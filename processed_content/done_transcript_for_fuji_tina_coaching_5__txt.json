Good. How's the babies and the family?\n00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.\n00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.\n00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone\nI'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.\n00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.\n00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone\nI will agree with you, that it's all right.\n00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nMy power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.\n00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo that almost never happens.\n00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.\n00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nto the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.\n00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?\n00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.\n00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh, yeah, the schedule.\n00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone\nIt's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.\n00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?\n00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone\nThat's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in\n00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nhousekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.\n00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.\n00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.\n00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone\nWe'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.\n00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.\n00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone\nI would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.\n00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. how did you find her?\n00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone\ndo you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.\n00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.\n00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.\n00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIt's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.\n00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?\n00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNineteen seventy six year of the dragon.\n00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone\nI have no shame.\n00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?\n00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone\nDoes she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.\n00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?\n00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone\nFour and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.\n00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd what kind of family are your neighbors?\n00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nTwo lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.\n00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?\n00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone\nThere's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.\n00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.\n00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone\nWe we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch\n00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\ntools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.\n00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.\n00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAh, look at that. We're applying switch.\n00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone\nI like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.\n00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLike, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.\n00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone\nWas it even mastery or something?\n00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nRevisited.\n00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.\n00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nEven if revisited. Okay.\n00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone\nThat's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.\n00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.\n00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone\nI will already totally read it.\n00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.\n00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.\n00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.\n00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone\nI forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?\n00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.\n00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone\nSorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.\n00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nFor that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.\n00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.\n00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nIs to not give it any power anymore.\n00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.\n00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nShe needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.\n00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.\n00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nfor 45 minutes.\n00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.\n00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nGreat. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.\n00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.\n00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nShe's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.\n00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo anyway. Yeah, I love that.\n00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAstronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?\n00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone\nOK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.\n00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOptimism is powerful.\n00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone\nIt's powerful. It's good.\n00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.\n00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nRegardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.\n00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.\n00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone\nThere's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.\n00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.\n00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone\nAre you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah\n00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?\n00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.\n00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.\n00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone\nWell, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.\n00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI love that you phrased it that way.\n00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone\nlove that you phrased it that way.\n00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\ntold me to.\n00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone\nlike that. I know.\n00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.\n00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.\n00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.\n00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone\nHas that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.\n00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.\n00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.\n00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?\n00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone\nOn the Q and E work.\n00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?\n00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone\nWell, Esther runs her own billing company.\n00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nShe bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.\n00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.\n00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd before the baby, how many hours a week was as\n00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.\n00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?\n00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone\nWell, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.\n00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. Watch it.\n00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone\nAll right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.\n00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOne of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?\n00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\n00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nMake that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.\n00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone\nis a statement. You know what I mean?\n00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.\n00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nis what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.\n00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.\n00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone\nThat's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.\n00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAgain, always leverage.\n00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone\nwhatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...\n00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?\n00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone\nYep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.\n00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.\n00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.\n00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\ndon't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...\n00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone\nAs Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.\n00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThere's a user report. Okay.\n00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone\nUm, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.\n00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLike, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.\n00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone\nBurn on average per day.\n00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.\n00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.\n00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.\n00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay.\n00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nyou're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.\n00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.\n00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.\n00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.\n00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.\n00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone\nsounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.\n00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I think your protein is low.\n00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd protein is low.\n00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.\n00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay.\n00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd if you click on it, you should be able to see all.\n00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.\n00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.\n00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.\n00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.\n00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah that didn't come through.\n00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nfor whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.\n00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone\nWell, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.\n00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.\n00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, that's that.\n00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThis is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.\n00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone\nI put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.\n00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Yeah.\n00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo. Is there a way to look better now?\n00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes.\n00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone\nThank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.\n00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSomewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.\n00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, no. That's not antagonizing.\n00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.\n00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone\nUm. What is the app you told me?\n00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.\n00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone\nI'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?\n00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNot just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.\n00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone\nI'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.\n00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nDid I have a really hard time writing?\n00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone\nSorry.\n00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLet's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?\n00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?\n00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.\n00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone\nAllow notifications.\n00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nit. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...\n00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone\nSo maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.\n00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nokay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.\n00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone\nYou don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.\n00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBecause that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.\n00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd you can change it every week.\n00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.\n00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone\nAnd oh, you have a list.\n00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nCan I have it?\n00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone\nI mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.\n00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.\n00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone\nOr I'm not going to be happy. OK.\n00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOK. But thanks.\n00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah.\n00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.\n00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay.\n00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nCool. Yes.\n00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone\nYes.\n00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHere's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.\n00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.\n00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nyou know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.\n00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone\nI'm excited.\n00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThis would be great.\n00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.\n00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.\n00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone\nPlease make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.\n00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\ngood. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?\n00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone\nI'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.\n00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nMost people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.\n00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?\n00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.\n00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone\nInteresting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.\n00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.\n00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone\nOkay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.\n00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.\n00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone\nlike, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.\n00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHe's loyal.\n00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.\n00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, a lot of things right.\n00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone\nAwesome. I value loyalty lot.\n00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nyeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?\n01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone\nOh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros\n01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nEmail to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.\n01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone\nYou gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.\n01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAwesome. And did you choose a time tracker?\n01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone\nI haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.\n01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWell, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.\n01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone\nSounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.\n01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nTotally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.\n01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone\nYeah.\n01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nhave a wonderful meeting.\n01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone\nThank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?\n01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.\n","contentPreview":"00:00:01 - Michael’s iPhone\nHello.\n00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHey, how are you?\n00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone\nGood, well.\n00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nare you?
