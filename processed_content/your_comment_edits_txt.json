I was working at a call center and had been for 6 years as a technical manager. We housed several tech giants like Apple, Intel, Adobe, Vizio.  \nI worked at Apple first as a technician but was in management within 2 months at the age of 20. I was already hooked on technology since age 8 when my cousin taught me BASIC programming and showed me how to write a game on a Radioshack TRS80 with25kb hard drive lol.\nThe call center taught me how to build networks from the ground up. I could build the servers and the crossover cables and do it in Appletalk, DOS, Sco Unix, Linux, Windows NT, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, and a coupel of Novell versions. Then I was taught how to manage metrics and do my own hiring and staffing in order to meet those metrics. I learned client diplomacy, how to hire good people, how to manage resources, and how to track and analyze data that kept me ahead of the game and constantly getting raises and bonuses.

I was working at a call center and had been for 6 years as a technical manager. We housed several tech giants like Apple, Intel, Adobe, Vizio.  \nI worked at Apple first as a technician but was in management within 2 months at the age of 20. I was already hooked on technology since age 8 when my cousin taught me BASIC programming and showed me how to write a game on a Radioshack TRS80 with25kb hard drive lol.\nThe call center taught me how to build networks from the ground up. I could build the servers and the crossover cables and do it in Appletalk, DOS, Sco Unix, Linux, Windows NT, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. Then I was taught how to manage metrics and do my own hiring and staffing in order to meet those metrics.
