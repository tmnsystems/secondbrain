How are you? Good. How is that onesie?\n00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nComfy, but I just started my period and I'm cramping and it hurts. And that is definitely what messed up my sleep. But did you know I did not know it messed up my sleep so bad until I started cracking my cycle?\n00:00:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, interesting.\n00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAnd that's the nights that you have a sleep. Oh my gosh, like the worst. And I never really made that correlation. Like I know what my cycle is. I almost always have a 28 day cycle, although in perimenopause, I've gone like four months, a few times without it. But because I take my hormones regularly, it kind of regulated it again.\n00:00:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, yeah.\n00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut the two days right before, I'm like, cannot sleep at all.\n00:00:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd then yesterday,\n00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nlike my I had the raging migraine all day long and my sugar was low no matter what I ate I even ate pizza and cookie dough oh and so that was really enjoyable but then like I woke up in the middle of the night and I could feel it dropping so then I went to eat more of it but I should not have done that because I felt like garbage anyway and then my sugar totally spiked on me I'm like you know make up your mind oh my god that's funny so then I went to sleep and my daughter went to seminary because we were so we were up early but like she can manage either seminary or school and can't seem to get both done because honestly it's a lot hmm yeah and she's trying to figure out herself and I'm in the place where I was just like oh and my other daughter she's in beauty school and she was not prepared for the fact that they were chemical peels on the faces yesterday, and microdermabrasion on the back. So her body went through it. And I'm just like, okay. And then I got asked out by this crusty old nasty man today, he texted. But like he tried ask me out a few years ago, I'm pretty sure he's old enough to be my dad.\n00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd I'm talking just crusty.\n00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\npeople's faces are cool. Okay, that was actually called gag reflex just now. I was not being sorry, dramatic. I just ate. And the thought of it is making me really, truly nervous. yeah, so he thought he would invite me to a church singles dinner. And I'm just like, I normally want to watch my mouth. But today I want to tell everybody to off.\n00:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSorry.\n00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI got you. I am very excited and happy to talk to you again.\n00:02:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, that's funny. God. what an experience for your holy cow. It's Interesting though that you're tracking your sleep cycles and you found it on the day of your period because it's like this morning I started watching YouTube video from a new person. I'm gonna start following She was on a hay house meditation because I couldn't sleep last night. So I started listening to it and she wrote the Book she's a doctor and but she writes about menopause as well and intermittent fasting and she's got a book She just released called Fast like a girl or something like and and then another one's about menopause for woman but anyway, the thing that she said was interesting is She she has a good YouTube video is about Phases you're in whether it's perimenopause whether it's menopause or post-menopause and the kind of Fasting or diet structure. That's good to follow. I found interesting. Anyways, I'm a little If you ever heard of her, I'll send you the link if you're interested. Yeah, my probably followers are already. I've learned so much. Okay, let me see. I'll send it to my friend, I'm not Amanda. I'm Amanda Chavon. My friend Chavon. My man in a group text. me just get this. There you go. Hold on. It's Dr. Mindy Hells. Yes. Oh, you know where? Okay. Okay, got it. And then it's so funny because when I was googling her, I'm like, I can't believe people make a business model on this because how many people Google her because she's big now. On Etsy, there are a ton of for like $2.99 or maybe $5.10, $18.\n00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAll of these planners for fasting using Indeed Peltz's protocol. Yeah, I mean, this is the thing because somebody was posting. Like, are we really in a recession? Like, is there really money problems? And I said. But here's the issue, there's plenty of money out there to be had by people who are creative and willing to be of service and to fill a need. But the other thing is that people who are doing that are also taking care of the people who don't know how to do that, who don't emotionally have it in them, who don't have resources or the capability for some reason, totally sorry I'm just like tangent, but like the gas prices, the groceries, the rent, all these other things, those things truly have increased 33 to 50% or more. Some of it has been like 400% looking at the grocery prices, it's closer to 400%. So people that are any kind of connected to their community are definitely filling the pain at the end. economy. But, you know, the perspective is, is that this, there is, did you ever see the movie robots with Will, Will Smith? No, yeah, I was Will Smith and that Robin Williams was in it.\n00:06:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, I'm sure I've seen it. Let me see, there's maybe Will Smith was the eye robot. Yeah, Okay, the cartoon one.\n00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, did you ever see it?\n00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI don't know.\n00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nMaybe not. Um, Robin Williams, it's a great cast. Jennifer Coolidge, Mel Brooks, William McGregor. It's amazing. Um, but, um, it was about this, uh, you know, awkward robot who didn't fit in, but he made his way in the world and he was a fan of this inventor who ended up being, you know, a jerk. But his thing was always see a need, feel a need. And that's how you make a arc and that's how you change the world and anyway so yes we really and truly are in a recession and but the reason people can't figure it out is because there is tons of money still being spent in a market but the the money has shifted but yeah oh you don't need all of it you just need enough and these people are like there's another quote that i love is um don't get in the way away if you think something's impossible get out of the way of people who are doing it or something like that love that yeah anyway so and all of this is in perfect alignment with what you're doing because i'll say we are doing yeah um because youtube is a way for everybody to get a piece of it and the whole you know what i came across and shared with you last week is that less than two percent or around two percent of youtube on YouTubers are actual content creators, that's wild.\n00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, anyway, well, no, and it was cool on the the teaching, like everyone loved it, and I'm doing a repeat of it on tomorrow as well. Oh, I should actually send an email out to remind people. Um, but, you know, it's just, it's so interesting that, um, people are looking for alternative things right now too, at the same time. Like, I don't know, maybe you do, but I hear from my other friends that people who used to sell a ton of switching tangent a little bit, who used to sell a lot of money on high ticket coaching, now trying to figure out what to do, right, because the sales aren't coming in. so now obviously they're looking at AC phones too, but, um, I think the YouTube thing, uh, is a no risk solution because it's free. Did I tell you? So my sister didn't even know that it was free to post a video on YouTube and start a channel.\n00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh, yeah.\n00:09:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI said, Oh, my God, Julia, I need to get you on a Zoom call and record you. And I post the video up because you're asking questions I never even thought people would have. I just assumed people, you know, so yeah, she's like, Oh, wow, that actually really is cool to launch a business that way, right? one of the guys on the YouTube course on Saturday, yeah, I also said that, um, yeah, we were always taught to monetize it by getting the subscribers and the views and then ads, but I love segueing to digital offers. So so and that's before I didn't tell anyone about the name change that we're going to do. I kept it to keep congruent with what they bought. I kept it as YouTube fast track naming convention, you know, I think I changed the slide deck to just say YouTube profits so that we didn't have to do too much re tooling later. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.\n00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI have my heating pad on too, just so you know Buffalo Plaid onesie so you can visualize this. I got up and took my daughter to oh my gosh I keep forgetting I got to meet with my attorney clients at one o'clock too. They're awesome I'm just like want to be in bed today not really but like physically. I was like that yesterday I actually from one o'clock on I just stopped working I but mine was different I had that hot chocolate hangover oh yeah yeah I finally feel amazed today but I'm getting back into intermittent fasting and I do feel better today like it's two o'clock I have energy so that's a good good thing yeah let's see Within two weeks, you just highlight all this. Here's the entire recording, um, but this is not downloadable, right?\n00:11:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, it is actually.\n00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me go there so I can download it. don't want to. Do you happen to have to zoom have a transcript for you? Because that would be what's most helpful to me.\n00:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUm, what I can do is upload it to unlisted YouTube channel and it produces the transcript.\n00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI get that. Would you please because I want to, um, go through and make the first version of an outline that you can go through. Oh, yeah, I covered all this. I bet you'll probably even surprise yourself by how maybe not because I know you studied any prepared everything. But with the questions that people asked you. Yeah. then everything that you covered. And then what we could do is look at did and um oh I don't know how good my brain is going to do right now sorry I was thinking about using Maui to create some you know graphically pleasing things that you're not spending time doing that and I could pay for that and and work with him and follow some instructions I was thinking um that you know lots of people make the make youtube products use youtube colors or they use their branding colors and I think a blend of because we know that blue is trust a deep dark a deep dark blue that goes good with the youtube red and um nice oh I like that I do let me see if I can find a hex color yeah the reason I chose the reds and the sales page because I remember watching another guy I don't know know is no heard of his name's Korosh I forget his last name he's kind of like a uh a secret allen sultanic like he's behind the scenes of a lot\n00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nlow ticket funnels as well. And I'm in his community because I paid $27 for his low ticket offer. He was reviewing someone's offer about YouTube. And I remember he gave the guy , he said, okay, you got to, the copy's not bad, but you know, you have to have red in here because this is YouTube course you're selling and people are familiar with YouTube and use the red. So that's where I got that little tip because normally I don't use red in my sales pages.\n00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. So dark blue gradient. I see that's a little darker than I want.\n00:13:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSo we're going to be like Superman colors than I was thinking. Oh yeah, I love that. Me too. I actually have a Superman t-shirt.\n00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI love it. So Marvel or DC? I'm a Superman's DC, but are you more Marvel or DC?\n00:13:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, I don't know the difference.\n00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI just like the movies. What? Yeah, I assume all of those are Marvel, but Superman is easy Batman and DC Now, you know nerdy I am That's cool.\n00:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI think I watched really cool I think what I mean about a TED talk how Marvel licensed a lot of these brands and it was yeah, it was a cool business kind of TED talk.\n00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Oh, yeah for sure so I think something not quite as dark as this, but I was hoping that if I picked one it would give me more Ooh like this something like that Um, so with the youtube red like that will just compliment really well.\n00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nLet's see You know, you literally could just grab the hexacode from the Superman logo I don't know you wanted to go that brighter blue.\n00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNo, I don't I well So I think about I strain when I okay And certain colors are easier on the eyes.\n00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nGod, okay. Okay.\n00:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, anyway, but I think something, something like that, and it almost feels kind of Superman esque. And you could put, let's if there's like a YouTube logo here, design elements.\n00:15:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd obviously, obviously a yellow will go with a nice fat too.\n00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Let's see. Elements back. I mean, they just look good together, that looks powerful to me.\n00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah. Yeah.\n00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nlooks really good, actually. I like that's pretty cool. That's got a nice and well, there's darker versions.\n00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI wonder what the darker version What's funny is check out, I'm going to put it in the zoom chat. I just googled like color combinations for red and blue. And this particular pin on Pinterest is kind of identical to the colors you got on there just for just for yachts. Go ahead and click that link in the zoom chat.\n00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nThat's hilarious, Maria. Yes. Are we not in sync? I love that. I love that. Oh, I like this. The colors are not quite the same, so we can edit to match.\n00:16:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nWell, I'm just going to grab my tea.\n00:16:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOK.\n00:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nMy tea.\n00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nMy green tea. tea. Mm, text. OK. Alrighty. I don't know. I am not a designer, but just just a little like idea. Something to start with. He's really great at stuff, but I like hobby. beginning of like let's use these kinds of colors um yeah i don't know but i mean i think it looks sharp i mean i will look that and go you or anything like that yeah no no i i love it i think it looks fantastic yeah yeah um just for the heck of do you want me to find that youtube sales page or that other guy for sure okay let me see let's we can use this as um just kind of gathering resources and then making a gangpline because you still have one call on deck for gaining information and then um but i would love to mass assimilate everything and if we're um you know we we weren't kind of opposite schedules but we don't need to be in meetings to be productive our rocks or chats are really productive i do screen captures i'm sure you do screen captures so like if we want to be aggressive about setting a deadline and putting something together like you can see i'm i'm willing to like we can create things together i can put things into membership areas like we can really roll this out quickly.\n00:19:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah. And I figured it'd be like go high level membership area because I know sistine.io has membership area but for like scaling it.\n00:19:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes and um worst key scenario like one of them worst case scenario but like damn um he would be helpful especially if you threw him a bum by not charging him so much or something. Yeah sure yeah but like he's got his team is like really good at it and fast and they know lots of things they could help us with the chat bot um so there's a lot that we could do and however that works out like uh I could help you with whatever you're doing with him like I don't want to uneven the burden but in terms of like getting something done quickly, efficiently, expertly. Yeah we've got some some resources to go to. My girl has um been kind of quiet. she's a young mom with young kids and trying to figure out babysitting stuff lately.\n00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOkay.\n00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut yeah, anyway, so I think that that could be a good place to start and build a home kind of quickly. I say easily because we've got people and if people need to be paid, I'm willing to put money out to pay for it. However, you know what I mean? Like I am in whatever this takes because I know that you're going to bring amazing content.\n00:20:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, it's hurting. Well, yeah, and what it'll be cool is like, here's what the Nirvana that I'm looking forward to. was going to say it because I know this is what you also will be good at. I'm sure and want to be in control of is like just all of the keeping to the plan, like the big rocks and\n00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nand future plan and having like financial meetings like you'll go okay like whether you hire a VA or someone to actually monitor you know the the money's coming in and money's going out for this and then um just I just think that would be really cool to have like CFO dashboard type meetings once a week or something or maybe it's in our like yeah so so yeah uh shoots so we can start I always start rudimentary we'll call it um you know we'll just do that and so we can track um so expense description I'm um source paid Um, so like if it's Tina's account or Maria's account, whatever, yeah, then revenue. Um, we'll, we'll track, um, resource, date, received, um, um, paid to Maria, yeah, I'm out, paid to Tina, out, we'll just, this is rudimentary too.\n00:22:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, I don't know, I get it, yeah.\n00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWow, and then oh, actually we'll go paid to Maria. Cause I have no idea how we're going to do it and organize, but I think that you were talking about like doing it US for reasons and so, yeah, you know, like because so many things are changing like now, even when I use, um, Upwork, they want to,\n00:23:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nand Fiverr. They want to charge me GST. So if I hire someone for like 10 bucks to do an e-book cover, then all of sudden they're charging 13% on it. So when I pay the person their 10 bucks, I'm also paying the extra $1.30. And that'll add up over time, which is ridiculous because me, I don't know how they're doing it because it's against tax law because the only time you pay GST is if the service provider lives in Canada as well. So if someone lives in Pakistan, I'm still paying this goods and services tax and harmonized tax. It's like, whoa, so yeah, we would lose out so much if we had to do through my Canadian company, all the members, like all the revenues in, all the expenses. I'd rather have your US entity have all the revenues in expenses and all that jazz.\n00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Well, we will, we will, we can plan on that and then figure out how to, you know, because we're not great, but that definitely sounds like we're probably better than, than doing it that way. So, um, Yeah, okay, so we will, so let me share this with you.-hmm. Sure. Yeah. Um, what, it's self-explanatory. Sure, anyway. You know, nobody can't, okay. Um, oh, what was the YouTube sales page?\n00:24:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, uh, yeah, I just set that to you in the Zoom chat.\n00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay.\n00:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nWell, there it is.\n00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nwas a nice time. It was a nice say it. Oh.\n00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nNow his givers are high because he's a YouTube agency as well. That created a little ticket. So all of those testimonials are his one-on-one agency client. So I thought that was a little not cool, but it is what it is, I guess.\n00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWell, yeah. So what is it about this that you do like and that you want to model?\n00:24:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nwhat, oh, no, no, no, nothing to model off. It was just, it was just, that was the funnel. The guy was critiquing because he had an old. for colors. And then and Kurosh was like, okay, you're selling YouTube and you got to make these colors red and white and black.\n00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, got you.\n00:25:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nThat's all. That was just the point. Like, I have no idea how well it converts. I'm sure it's good. But obviously he's got a good back end because he does like high ticket AMC YouTube work for people. So yeah.\n00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah.\n00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nBut I mean, it's not much of a product. He's just giving out 100 done for your video. He's actually bought it. It's just a freaking like, of course, he has some videos about it, which is good. But it literally is just like beginnings, like the hooks for a video. It's ridiculous.\n00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI wonder what kind of YouTube PLR we could get to value stack.\n00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, I already bought one on Etsy. And if you pull in that Canva template that I gave to resell rights, the YouTube ultimate, the ultimate YouTube planner. And it was Pretty decent, actually.\n00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nUm, what kind of did you give me?\n00:26:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUm, yeah, I think I also sent you like in that email that I gave you a copy of. There's a link to the slide deck. Actually, I'm sorry.\n00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI didn't like give you the Canva template on Friday and it's in the Trello board Friday night.\n00:26:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, if you just click the Google Drive link, I can show you where the links are to the presentation as well, whichever is easiest.\n00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nUm, well, let me get two profits for you and change this.\n00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, I don't know if I put it in that board, so I think I might put it in the list of YouTube profits under HQ, Business HQ, I think.\n00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh, yeah, because that's where we decided we were going to do things. Yeah, so, um, there you go, draft presentations. Yeah. Yeah, I have bad the windows that you probably can't see that are in the way I got to move. Oh, OK. Out of the way in the chat, uh, sorry. Where am I going?\n00:26:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUnder YouTube profits for offer. Let's do the second one draft presentation. Oh, okay. I moved it up higher.\n00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo you could see it higher Dang it open. I just want to open you.\n00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nThank you. There you go. Okay, cool Oh, look at this Yes Well, maybe I can See that way and if you go to page 12 Oh, I quoted you on the on the video on page 10 Uh, and then when I'm talking I say and this was from my friend Tina Marie that said this so good Do you want to live on youtube or do you want to live? I mean there now everything else I've made the don't be temple bundle research and google worship But the ultimate youtube planner camera template that's from master resale rights. It's actually pretty darn good I just changed the the the beginning of it um Yeah I just changed the cover page see how it's got pictured me there Gleeing against the graffiti wall.\n00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes Oh, I see.\n00:28:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOkay. I mean, it's pretty decent.\n00:28:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. And we could just change the branding like the style and the layout or did you already do that?\n00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nWell, all I did is change the cover to put a picture of me in the background. I didn't really didn't teach by it. I said, look, if you're the type of person that needs a planner, here's this because the Google Google sheet is really the planner and the implementation thing, you know?\n00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Just the tiniest bit of like making everything white instead of cream and like maybe changing the font and apply all so that it looks slightly different. I agree. it doesn't look at an immediate man thing.\n00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI literally downloaded it Friday at 11 p.m.\n00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nwith before this. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not saying you should have done it already. I was just saying we do this and I'd be happy to do it and all that. And you did so much.\n00:28:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, yeah, I was up to a minute on Friday preparing it.\n00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou are, you our rock star workhorse. It's so good.\n00:29:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nThe real man is for you to be making the money and like it not be for your clients or a husband or whatever. feel good that way and then Tina and honestly made me think because there's two other people that remember there was a few people pipeline. There's two other people still pretty serious about wanting to hire me and it makes me think like just to stick with this and this only you know and not even entertain. I'm just telling them hey look I'm fully booked till January February something. don't know but just because listen this pulled in I envisioned 30 sales I said 30 spots do you know that because remember when I talked there was 20 spots like 2k I think at five minutes to 12 before it closed and redirected to hey it's closed URL the 30th sale came in and I was and I was visioning 30 spots.\n00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nAh, girl, that manifestor in you.\n00:30:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYes. Yeah. So I thought that was cool. Now I reopened it just today to close to work since I'm teaching again live tomorrow. So I'm just going to send a quick email to my list in case any stragglers because I've had a few messages. Hey, can I still get in? But yeah, anyways, just some thoughts about that.\n00:30:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYou've got the one guy at $5,000 every month and you said that covers your lights on costs, right?\n00:30:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nIt really does. Like I do pay Sally some money out of it. Like I paid her 500 a few days ago to work on like the crap stuff that I like to do, like the formatting inside the funnel and his go-high level account and like putting together some.\n00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, go ahead. All right. Before I lose my train of thought because my pain, I lose my focus or easy. Yeah. One second. almost did it. Oh, so in terms of like now, this wouldn't be as much money. But first of all, right now, like your needs. are close to met, especially with the extra little bit of income, but would it not be more joyful for you even if you just did another let's say four more live webinars through the end of the year and sold that or we just like hustled out and knocked this out and made another two, five to 10k, who knows? the potential for 10k is pretty easy if we really work quick and but I think this would be so much more joyful. I don't to settle for anybody else's stuff. I think that this is a prime time for launching a product like this.\n00:31:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd what did you sell up for? Oh, just I just said it's 97. It's normally two 97 early bird price. And I said, Hey, this also probably become a $1,000 course because I'm adding to right?\n00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI think what if you kept selling it at 97 the end of the year. And on January, let's say fifth, right? So that people have time to get through the holidays and make a last minute decision. It's 97. But at that point, it goes to 147. And we don't tell them, we just tell them the price is increasing. Period. End of story, never to be this low again. And we can let it just, you know, microscopically kind of increase to 147. But if you already got that many sales at 97, and it was kind of by the seat of your pants, granted, your pants are brilliant marketer pants.\n00:32:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nthey're not average pants, right?\n00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nbut the sales page is . going to admit that.\n00:32:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nThe delivery and the content is amazing. Like that's where I spent all my time. there's probably 12 hours and just two hours of And I both know the ugly converts and words probably were not should be on the page. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I did have cell the screenshot, some of the people's zoom comments and she stuck it on the sales page, this more, a few of them.\n00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, not average pants, that's a long thing.\n00:33:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, I understand, yeah. And I did tell them that I'll be coming to them within seven days with a very small survey for their feedback, make this course even better, but also in little testimonial contests where they can win a $500 reward. So someone will win like a one hour with me. But I definitely want real testimonials, not just in a zoom comment, but like someone either emails me or leaves a comment on Facebook, on my post, or they send in a video testimonial.\n00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo here is a, obviously I've had no time to think this through, but what if, and I don't know how your, your viewer listed, but you're getting, you're getting, how many of the people that came to it, came through you too?\n00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nyou know? Isn't that interesting? Yeah, you know, I tried do a little poll. I'm not like I did an official poll who has a YouTube channel who doesn't and 80 percent of people have a YouTube channel who came um but um I would say uh probably out of the 30 people I would say 10 I was really surprised that they came from YouTube first joined school I will say that so then the school could be at five bucks a month uh and then school and I didn't really again I would say a one out of ten effort um I just posted a couple of posts to join the YouTube class um and that's really it so so I think even more could have came from it so that might be an interesting funnel YouTube videos to a school low low price you know five bucks a month thing to that your other digital offer\n00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo that could be something interesting, play it at work as well.\n00:35:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nWhich, when you think about it, is what I think Hermosi is really teaching on school.\n00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI could not care less about that guy, so I never even think about it. Oh, I know, I know, know. Funnel idea. And that might be wrong because maybe the better funnel idea is we stick with what we're talking about. We send them to a low ticket offer or a webinar. No, because it's already worked. Yeah, it does. Thank you. you. You, you, you, in less than two weeks of having this idea specifically, and this offer, as far as I know, you've only had this particular offer for teaching YouTube profits that you've been talking about for just two weeks. And that's correct.\n00:35:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nTwo weeks. That's correct.\n00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nyou, you, for sure, there was Facebook traffic and there was YouTube traffic. And I think you need to banish the low ticket in terms of like less than $97. I don't think we have to go there. I think we want to go there later to spend it, but right now. how if we want to maximize eyeballs and profitability and also energy and the fact that you got 30 people to say yes at 97 in two weeks they have to warm up to the idea that's pretty powerful those are powerful signals so let's mimic what you already did so it's YouTube and Facebook to school to sales page to live webinar or ESL or other webinar drop it and turn into that what what\n00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYes, what what what this for yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, we we could really capture the whole craziness about school right now. Um, know, there's so many people that are intrigued about school because of Alex Hermosi and I have to say it was easy.\n00:37:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLike even getting stuff up on system IO, there's still always pain in the butt, whereas I have to say for a lot of people delivering knowledge and coaching on school is probably one of the simplest software plays ever.\n00:37:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nWhy instead of getting more complicated right now, why don't we just do the YouTube class and course on school?\n00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBecause you can unlock that like that can be its own paid thing. Hold on, let's go into school. Yep. Yeah, right now I a Black Friday toolkit that is locked.\n00:38:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, everybody's already there.\n00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo, um, I should because you put me as a admin.\n00:38:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI did. You are an admin in mine. What if I change it to business accelerator? But I kept the make money with Maria online there for now because what you and I need to talk about is if we're going to probably start a new YouTube channel around this new brand of ours, I could record the setting up of that channel as part of the training material too.\n00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut yeah, why can't I? I should see it and make money online with Maria's doll. Yeah, okay, so classroom. Yeah, so the YouTube thing could be in here or we could create a whole new one for an extra $100 a month when that's one of the customers out of 30 you already sold. So like we can make that investment and it be worthwhile and and so and they'll see it and you can link to it Here if we have any other courses we can link to that. Why don't we just stick with school my Sorry, man my my brain just goes in and out when I get a rush of pain and heat Okay Got to catch my breath for a second Um So I like speed of implementation and I like minimum viability for new products. Yeah long term I would like to build out a robust system that does really good Nurturing and that's what I think high level is great for. Yeah, I have to take time here. I'm sorry. Hold on My body is going through it. Okay, um, do you just can come and just resurrect me right now.\n00:39:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nI'll be okay with that Okay\n00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay, with that, Jeez. Come on. So, yeah, so minimal invincibility, it is an extra expense, it's, I mean, a go-high level is $300 a month anyway at an agency level. you know, we could put that at, like, 2, 2025, where, okay, now we've got a community, now we've got people, and we could just start, instead of migrating people over, we can offer them, say, hey, we're migrating, but basically, live in both areas until everybody dies off here, or we moved over and can incentivize them to move over, because you get lost when you try to move people to new building, right? already got subscriptions going, and that's not good. Yeah. So, anyway, we could do that, but in the meantime, this allows us to teach them quickly into fulfill what's been sold and to nurture them, and then high level would be part of the larger master Sound which is first of all kind of automating the teaching experience with the follow-up Hey, did you check out this you know module one? I noticed you didn't check it out. Here's what you should what you can do for blah blah blah which takes a lot of time to write that kind of Engagement nurturing sequence, but we'll get more people to consume the content More people to get results and really help us to make a bigger impact which also then creates more brand awareness We'll sort of mouth all that but in addition to it then we can start working on expanding the You know the marketing and the business growth and upgrading right so higher value higher price and But also now where you can you will have money that we will have earned from here like like let's set a goal hold on so if we're talking about the beginning of q2 in 2025 that we've made 80,000 through this by then. So 40,000 for you, 40,000 for me, but let's say we set aside 10,000 for each. So maybe like we set aside 20% for business growth includes marketing systems teams forever. And then we just put that in a kitty. And it's, it's, you know, but high visibility, you see it, I see it, we both can see it. you know, you know, we know exactly where the money is at, at all times. And we have weekly updates on finances and total transparency. And not because either of us have any concern, but because that's just a practice. don't allow apathy, we don't allow any kind of temptation or anything to create that. I'm not worried about it, but the thing this, as soon as you stop worrying about stuff like that, you know, the adversary is good at what he does.\n00:42:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd he can, he can twist people.\n00:42:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo we just want to make sure that we avoid that opportunity and have total transparency on a weekly basis. Anyway, so you set aside. 8%. I think there's, for sure, I think we could do $80,000 by then. But even if we did half of that by then and have the whatever other income coming in and manage the resource as well, move it to high level, launch the bigger thing. We've got a following, we've got people who should automatically upgrade, even if it's 10% and even if it's 10% of let's say like 300 people and not, I think that that's conservative. Based off of the 30 you got into weeks.\n00:43:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah.\n00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo, um, let's just kind of write it down as like a. Let's see. So, would we start from scratch, a new school community, or what do you think? I think you do because then you get it branded. And you can really use branding power, give it a very specific name so that people who are curious. Let's just about and then they watch the sale. video that can be right there on that page.\n00:44:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah. And and and I think it's good too, because then we can keep it specific to the like people search now in school for stuff. And obviously, if they searched anything to do with YouTube, they wouldn't find me.\n00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nBut one guy did say he's sorry. I said right.\n00:44:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah. But one guy for the make money from me online, he did search digital offers, and that's how he found me. That's how he joined. So I thought that was cool to hear as well.\n00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI love that. So my brain is going by myself. I'm just going to this is going to be all over place. Q two.\n00:44:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nIt's okay.\n00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLevel. Whoa. Okay. Now. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh, yeah. That's how this works. So let's see. Road map. Whatever. It's different than that, but we'll see that. So Q4, new school group dedicated to 97 a month, YouTube, of course, price, goes back in January. What's the what's the first Monday after the first week of January? January 6th, or was I at trouble? This is it? January 6th, 2025 and we'll One, four, seven. Okay. Huge. Huge.\n00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd.\n00:47:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nSo, this is kind of capturing what we were talking about. So, we're talking EK by March, 20,% in growth accounts for those units. So, that's it. etc. Okay, so that captures what we're doing. So now, in the meantime, what what we need is to figure out what can we do and like what are you willing to do? What do you want to do? don't know how exhausting was to do that that life call. Do you want to do another one and do it like in two weeks from now so you have some more time to build it up and we just like build out a marketing campaign and devote some money to those, whether it be YouTube ads or just...\n00:48:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, I think we could because I still think 97 is a good price point to cool traffic. Yeah, and we just have to... Yeah, I mean, we'd have more testimonials too on sales patient. Pretty powerful. And literally, we have no upsells or downsells or order bumps so can imagine how much money... We could make. Um, yeah, I'm game for that.\n00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nLet's plan that out too. Okay, so, um, um, um, plan. We'll let be another live webinar in two weeks. So, um, so do you want to do it two weeks from last Saturday?\n00:49:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUm, yeah, we can do that.\n00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nwe'll just check in this enough time. Oh, I mean, you did that crazy fast.\n00:49:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSo, yeah, no, teaching is not a problem. It's more the ads for in the sales page. Because my thought processes, do we keep it in Sistine.io or do we move that to your high level account?\n00:49:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nNo, so what I think we do is keep the same thing while we're building out the back end and delivering the content, sell it the same way you sold it. So, we're not over complicating anything while putting out the long term strategy, but that allows us to just. been to making money now and kind of just refining the process.\n00:50:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nGot it. Okay.\n00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOkay. Um, so that was, that would be November 16th. And man, I'm kidding. Yeah.\n00:50:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSorry, my brain just checks out. No, no, no. Um, and we can talk more about tomorrow because when I do paid traffic, I like, I'll cry if we don't have an old bump or an upsell.\n00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes. So let's, let's just kind of think about that real quick. And I think that, um, you could have that be, um, you know, it, maybe it is just an upgrade of another $100 a month, but then they get access to a higher level group and you'll answer personal questions, like we don't have to overcomplicate it, it could be critiquing, it could be like, you know, what are the typical upsells that? Oh, go ahead.\n00:51:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I misunderstood. Um, I never liked selling anything recurring on a funnel, that type of traffic. So, well, except the $5 a month was a no-brainer for the school community, but so I was thinking that the current system, Iowa, um, pages for $97 one shot. So, so that one would have the order bump and the upsell because school doesn't allow order bumps.\n00:51:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nRight. So what I'm saying is what, what could be offered as an order bump so that we're maximizing on that.\n00:51:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUm, yeah, um, I gave away so much, unfortunately, in the original thing. So, um, and if we're gonna keep it at 97, I don't think I'd want to take anything away. So the natural thing for especially an upsell is anything that accelerates that. Um, so, Well, usually it's templates, but I really kind of give away the templates they need. I can't I think I need to think about it.\n00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nUm, Yeah.\n00:52:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nUm, I mean, one thing I think that would be cool for them to have, but I don't want to deliver it is like once a week working sessions, like, you know, how you show me that one time for ADHD owners, but I don't want to deliver on that. don't want to, as an empath, that just kill me.\n00:52:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, I go through your templates and figure out what is still a good stack, but what can you separate? So that it doesn't have to be a big upsell and and also remember, you know, we're testing. This is what testing. So if we find that person's drop because you took something away, yeah, then, you know, we revamp it and we we learn. Um, but if if go ahead, I know a really good upsell.\n00:52:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nIf we took out, because I don't know why much that sold on the sales page because I didn't really make it clear or talk about it a lot, but what would make a good upsell is something called the automated YouTube growth stack and it's us teaching them how to hire a VA, how to manage them. Here's the scripts. Yeah, like here's the SOP you give them, like the stuff that I was going to do in scribe anyway. That would be an amazing upsell one.\n00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nHigher VA scripts you give them. Remind me something else.\n00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh, a standard of frame seizures so that they literally can just give them, hey, here's the research and planning SOP. Go plan out four videos for me, you know, for this month. Here's the how to upload a YouTube video SOP, you know, go do this for me. Like it'd be systemized by the process.\n00:53:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nWhat about this also?\n00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYes, yes. Yeah.\n00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYes, so you and I, like, you know, yeah, we could do that. We could knock that out pretty quickly and we could get it done in two weeks. Yep. Um, I'm the kind of person who will stay up all night in the middle of the night to meet a deadline. And, um, I would rather not do that, I 100% with, like, I'm, I won't promise something and not fulfill it. So, um, I can't.\n00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYou know, that's how I work.\n00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI mean, that's how this YouTube thing got done.\n00:54:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nIf I didn't have pre sales of it, it would still be.\n00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOh, I should do this course. I know, but I want you to know that that's who I am too, because it hasn't yet yet. And, um, because we're talking about an aggressive timeline. And I know that you know that there are a lot of people be like, this is cool. Let's do this. And then crickets. Um, yeah, you're the one pulling the all nighter and doing that kind of stuff. So I want you to know that, like, I'm, I'm game for this. This is a sprint. And for me, you know, you kind of suffer for sprints a little bit and then you, you take break and so holidays are coming. That'll be a good break time and we will be able to coast through that off of the, the high of having served and delivered really well and we can spend, you know, a couple of weeks at the end of December, just really nurturing the group instead of creating anything or doing any webinars or anything, just spending whatever time that we are working, nurturing people, taking care of them, answering questions, letting them get to know us and the mama bears, like we are, um, and, and that can be where our personality and that part of the branding kind of comes through. And, uh, I think that that would be great. So, um, this. Yes. So. I don't want to. Oh, gosh. I got to go because I have to get ready for this call. So I think this was amazing. I don't want to laugh because it makes me cramp really bad.\n00:56:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSorry. Okay.\n00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nRight. So if we meet tomorrow, even honestly, I don't even think that we have to meet tomorrow. We can just start working. Man, why am I losing my breath? my asthma is bugging me really bad right now too. So, so let's see planning. So if we figure out what has to happen to make these happen. Yeah. What, like, what would you create? So the Trello board, like, I can create something, but all needs. some stuff to plug into it so I can see like, you know, what are you thinking? then I'll be able to riff off of what you create. But right now, like, I, there's a blank canvas in my brain. And so I'll a I'll do a quick loom video for you, because honestly, just face off the checklist in the Google spreadsheet, because that is my process. So, yeah, um, at Maria, please get me a transcript. And so we can start with that also. And so that should tag you. And we are going to have more tasks come out once I get that. And once you start with the the SOPs. And then we're going to be busy. Let's see. I would love to see if, if, If we can get a good turnout for two weeks from now, I would love to do it one more time while we're thinking and maybe take that best recording and turn it into an auto webinar.\n00:58:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOh yeah, that'd be cool, yeah.\n00:58:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nOr clip it and make VSL out of it or something like that. then we can script out and maybe make a better video and then talk about our own YouTube channel. But in the meantime, if we want to capitalize on making money, the fact that, you know, there's this end of the year buying, there's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the new year, you, all these types of things, then rather than try to make it perfect right now, let's just show up, you know, two more times, which is easy for me to say because I'm not the one showing up to do the webinar, but I think that as long as you're not overwhelmed with the rest of the work, that's kind of like an area that you like doing and you've already done the research. So I build an support for you in in between those times, I think it wouldn't be too much. But let me know if I'm wrong.\n00:59:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nLet's talk about it, you know, throughout the week, because I might. Yeah, because Sally started performing pretty good on on some of that funnel work for the other clients. So my time might be more freed up than I thought. So let's see.\n00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah.\n00:59:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nOkay.\n00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nI mean, in terms of like, would you be willing to do two for live webinars, one in two weeks and one four weeks later?\n00:59:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, when you mean live webbers, you mean, itching the thing, like people.\n00:59:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah, what you just did.\n00:59:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, absolutely.\n00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. Yeah. if that is something you're willing to do, and we do all the rest of this stuff, I think that that the revenue will come through that vehicle without a lot of complicated stuff while we build the fulfillment mechanisms, then we can build the automated leverage sales mechanism where you don't we're not doing like. webinars. We're doing either auto webinars or VSLs or creating a separate YouTube channel that is a magnet for leads and to this funnel anyway.\n01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, yeah, that makes sense.\n01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah. So simple and it's all because you did what you do naturally, just creating videos, doing research, discovered a system, wanted to teach it, and this blossomed out of Maria just being Maria.\n01:00:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nYeah, and so the only next thing to talk about, mainly miners, how to manage my time because now that I'm doing more of this, I'm more visible, I'm getting a lot of messages in my Facebook messenger, hey, we should connect. what about this?\n01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nhey, I had a consult call few months ago, I'm thinking of in the most. should read that you can. So even if it's just audio voices and dumps, like these are the scenarios. These are the things that are coming up. I would like help with figuring out how to handle this. So right now I have a vague idea of what it is, but they claim I am on exactly what's happening. Okay. You know how to have some people, let's just do this, this, this, and this. We'll not available, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And just to handle it, because you don't need to do anything other than this and take care of the one guy that you have.\n01:01:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nSo that's what I'm thinking and also just I don't want to also ruin good karma because some of these people are potentially good people for next year if we want to have one high ticket client for quarter one on one, you know? Right.\n01:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nthen we use like, you know, I'm filled up until this time and this is what's coming on. Do you want to be at the top of the list? And if you do, it requires a deposit. And if you don't, No worries. I'm just reached out to me. if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. And I love it. And nobody gets offended by it. People do get offended by it. That automatically lets me know there were too much of a diva to work with anyway.\n01:02:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nAnd thank you very much. Yeah, yeah.\n01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nPerfect.\n01:02:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)\nyou.\n01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)\nYeah.
