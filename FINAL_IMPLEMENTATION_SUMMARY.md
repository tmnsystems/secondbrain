## 1. System Architecture Overview

The SecondBrain system has been successfully implemented as a Multi-Claude-Persona (MCP) architecture that integrates multiple specialized AI agents into a cohesive, autonomous workflow system. The architecture centers around an OrchestratorAgent that coordinates communication and workflow execution across specialized agents:

                     ┌─────────────────┐

```

The implementation follows four core principles:
1. **Specialization**: Each agent has distinct responsibilities and capabilities
2. **Coordination**: The OrchestratorAgent manages communication and workflow execution
3. **Extensibility**: New agent types can be added to extend system capabilities
4. **Integration**: Agents can be combined in different ways to accomplish complex tasks

## 2. Agent Workflow Implementation

The agent workflow has been successfully set up with a structured approach to task management and execution:

### 2.1 Workflow Definition

Workflows in SecondBrain are defined with a structured format that specifies steps, inputs, outputs, error handlers, and other metadata. Each workflow executes as a coordinated series of agent actions.

```typescript
interface WorkflowDefinition {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  version?: string;
  input?: SchemaDefinition;
  output?: SchemaDefinition;
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  errorHandlers?: ErrorHandler[];
  timeoutMs?: number;
  tags?: string[];
}
```

### 2.2 Notion Integration

The NotionAgent serves as a critical component for task management and documentation:

- Project documentation is stored in Notion with structured pages and linked databases
- Tasks are tracked in a dedicated Notion database with properties for status, priority, agent, and dependencies
- Timeline visualization is implemented as a Gantt chart for project planning
- Knowledge base management enables capturing and retrieving information

### 2.3 Seven-Stage Build Flow

The system implements a comprehensive Seven-Stage Build Flow that includes:

1. **Planning**: Task analysis and breakdown by the PlannerAgent
2. **Design**: Architecture and interface design
3. **Building**: Code generation and component creation
4. **Testing**: Verification and validation by the TestAgent
5. **Review**: Quality assessment and recommendations by the ReviewerAgent
6. **Refinement**: Optimization and improvement by the RefactorAgent
7. **Deployment**: Release preparation and execution by the ReleaseAgent
