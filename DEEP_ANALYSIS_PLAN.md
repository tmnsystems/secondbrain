## Priority Framework

All analysis tasks will be prioritized using the following framework:

1. **Foundation Criticality**: How fundamental is this to the system's integrity?
2. **Future Impact**: How significant is this for future adaptability?
3. **Current Risk**: What is the immediate risk of not addressing this?
4. **Implementation Effort**: What resources are required to address this?

Tasks will be classified as:
- **Critical**: Foundation elements with high future impact and current risk
- **Important**: Elements with significant future impact or moderate current risk
- **Valuable**: Elements that enhance the system but have lower immediate impact
- **Optional**: Elements that provide incremental benefits

## Timeline Considerations

Rather than focusing on speed of execution, this plan prioritizes thoroughness and quality. The timeline will be adaptive, with these guidelines:

1. **Foundation Analysis**: This is the most critical phase and should not be rushed.
2. **Incremental Documentation**: Documentation should be created and updated incrementally.
3. **Continuous Integration**: Analysis findings should be continuously integrated into development.
4. **Quality Gates**: Each phase should include quality gates before proceeding.

## Success Criteria

The deep analysis plan will be considered successful when:

1. A comprehensive architecture blueprint is established
2. All critical technical debt is identified and prioritized
3. Extension points are well-documented and tested
4. A clear future-proofing roadmap is established
5. Development standards are documented and implemented

The ultimate goal is to ensure SecondBrain remains adaptable, extensible, and maintainable as it evolves and forms the foundation for other applications and services.
