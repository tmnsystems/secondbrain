How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.

And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Sorry, I'm late. I had a call just went long, but it was people I haven't talked to for years, and I was like, I gotta go. gotta go. it was so good. They're old clients and they were they are marketing agency and their primary clients were yoga studios and then COVID happened. So that just changed their lives and they couldn't afford to work with me anymore. And so she's just like, for months, she's like, I gotta talk to Tina, gotta talk to Tina. And so and I finally got them back, but it's a moment and pop is a husband and wife team. I watched their kids grow up. anyway, you know how I feel about you guys.
00:00:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, totally.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my people. So that was fun. But I'm sorry I'm late.
00:00:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
don't mean to be disrespectful of your time. Oh, that's no problem.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How am I in good to get to reconnect? How have you been? you seem like you're doing great?
00:01:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm doing well. You know, just things are going well with Tim who's the the gym owner guy. I've got my first promotion that I'll put together for him. It's going to start next week. And so I'm just crossing all the eyes, that kind stuff and and we'll see how this this goes primarily going out to his Facebook group and then his email list or a segment of his email list about you know 2,500 people and I ran his email this is interesting because like he gets really good open rates like we'll get 48 50 percent people open. But the the are like 0.3 0.4 percent. to and it's like that on every email that that I send every email that he sends even he was giving away thing I was like he was he ran this big giveaway of this it's called an in body scanner that a lot of gyms use so that people can like figure out their body fat percentage and muscle percentage up in skeletal density all this stuff and he did a deal with in body to give one away for free Wow. And send it out to his list and you know point three point four percent fifty percent opened nobody's clicking and so like I've so anyway I've just never run into that so I think there's probably Either he's got some spam accounts in there that may be opened and I don't know what the deal is, but he's working with Adrian Savage on email and deliverability and segmenting getting like the most engaged, 30-day engaged list and that kind of stuff. like he's working with good people on the email front, it's just a bizarre thing. So what I'm doing on this is I'm sending really like one or two line emails and getting people to reply if they're interested in getting the details.
00:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start?
00:04:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right, it will start next week.
00:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I haven't haven't tried it yet. So have you checked his cinder score? Is no, I haven't checked his cinder score.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. What's his emailing domain?
00:04:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, it is. P.F., marketing solutions.com.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And make me log in on to like create an account. Let's go. When get emails, do they go to your inbox?
00:05:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And did it happen immediately?
00:05:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's good. And but also like, um, let's check this. Oh, let me call it one second way. And take this underscore.
00:05:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, hmm. Oh, wow. Awesome. Very high. Mailing from infusion soft. Yeah. Or score 98. There's only one that's 91. all the rest of them are 98. So like, is there a disconnect maybe? And who he's getting on his email list versus what's being emailed out?
00:06:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, he's right now the ads that are running to get people both into the group and into the Facebook group and on the email list. I wrote it while I wrote the ad. It's about it's for, like, it's specifically for gym owners. So it's got all the right targeting as far as the language that attracts people in. that ad is performing well. People are coming to the group, and then they have to answer, I think, two or questions about their gen to get in the group and all that. He's using, what's it called, it's that there's a service that connects your Facebook group questions and infusion soft, so people are opting in to the list when they join the group. Along with all their info, so I don't think it's attracting non-Gem owners, it could be the wrong type of gem owner, which admittedly I don't know what that is, like, what, how to. to find what the wrong gym owner is for him, but I have thought, like on the other side of his promotion for him, of doing, you know, running an ad that's a little, that would maybe pull in some somebody who runs a gym who's maybe little more advanced, like by, because he's got all these different tracking sheets that he uses internally at his gym in Arizona, and I thought maybe we could, you know, give away something that, something like, you know, your marketing math sheet is what he calls it, it's one of the things that he has in his program, maybe if we were to give something like that away, to test that that may speak to somebody who's at a maybe a little further along in their gym where somebody knew they don't I mean they probably have that problem but they're just trying to get you know business through the door. So I don't know I mean he's got a this the girl Amanda who is there like his CMO essentially and Adobson Amanda Dake yeah yeah D-A-K-E and she's great like I have a call with her every week and you know she's she I mean I think she's doing a a fine job advising him and I think she knows him from I don't know if they worked together or what, but she knows Tim from years ago through something else. don't know. haven't asked, but yeah, it's just an interesting thing with his email list, so that's something to work on, and he's got this, but I'm writing so much for him. I he's getting, like, I wrote this new letter for his program that we're using next week, but I mean, I'm excited. It's so much better than the letter he was using, and, I mean, we'll see, you never know, but I think the letter I wrote for him is just really good. the customers will determine if it's a right fit. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have you been working for him? what is he paying you?

I started like in the middle of April, April 17th. Bill and five grand a month. It's for 30 days. I said a minimum of 90 days and then we'll reconnect and basically see if we want to keep working together, which I think if the promotion goes well, like if it gets, I mean, because he's selling this thing for $7,500. And it's, you know, book a call, that kind of thing. He's got his partner, Randy, handling the sales. It's really about a number of calls booked and people who get closed, and he really wants to follow this, I don't know if you're familiar with the clients and community guys, he wants to follow their model, so he bought their program and gets coaching for them. So I went through that they're training, and so we're running this promo following their guidelines because they lay it out, and it's fine, it makes a lot of sense, but it's basically in a similar to what Travis does with the tapping, so it's basically like all the posts are designed to get people to raise their hand. And he's got this appointment setter that follows up with them through DM to give them the details. I've written like three different scripts for her like DM scripts because they didn't them. But this will be the first time that we're selling, actually selling something. Everything else has just been so far like give value, give value. Which again is what the clients and community guys teach. So I don't know if let's say this promotion doesn't go well. I think we get five or six people to buy. It'll be considered a success and it'll probably want to keep working together. If it's not a success, I think he'll still want to keep working together. he may come back asking for a lower price and which I may be open to, but I would have to reduce the scope of what I'm doing for him now. Because I'm basically doing all of his copywriting. I mean, 95% of it. And all the Facebook posts, it's a couple emails a week. week I did an email every day to promote his event in the fall called the gross summit. And I ran a promotion for that. don't think anybody bought, I think it's a little early to be selling an event in September. But we didn't run a promotion in the group, it was just as email-less and we weren't talking about that. But I didn't want to run the promotion in the group because we got this bigger promotion coming up. that would have, even though the price point for the event is a lot lower, it's like $2.97 to attend. And I thought selling that in the group and then two weeks later selling this bigger ticket item, the sequencing just didn't make sense to do that. And we can run a... Pre-summit promotion later and summer closer to the date of the event. But I'm writing a couple of direct mail letters form as well. And I wasn't going to rewrite his sales letter for this program because I saw it and I was like, that's not a bad sales letter. But then I went through his program. And like I watched every single video at double speed and it's like, oh my gosh, there's so much more in here that is not even talked about. And so, so then I was like, all right, well, need a new letter. Sorry about that. And. Yes, I don't know what I guess I'll see one. He just paid his second bill, so his third one will be June 17th, so we'll do a check-in middle of July to see if he wants to keep working together, and I think he will. I mean, he's been really happy with what I write. He knows that the email list is doing what it's doing. But yeah, so that's the stuff that's going on with Tim. I paid off one of my credit card balances. I was a smaller one. was like $2,800, but I paid it off. That felt good, and then I'll pay off a second one in July, because I'm just setting money aside. That one will be like a little over six grand that I pay off. And, yeah, so just climbing out of the hole, things with Brian are going to well, we're going to do over-deliver boot camp in July and I am, you know, I'm really largely out of the the tech stuff, which is great. And we're kind of in a lull where you were at this time last year. What's that?
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a that's a big like where you're at right now in terms of the tech stuff, I think is like, I'm so different from where you were this time last year.
00:18:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great because like, you know, we've I got social media posts now running for. for Brian, that I have somebody else writing, she's from the Philippines, and she's doing a great job. then we've got this, we're taking all the, well, TXL calls, we're Jeremy Wise is turning them into podcasts. so now we're sending out weekly emails every Wednesday for just promoting a specific episode. that's largely hands-off for me because the the same writer doing social media is writing the emails for the podcast and Brian's editing them. And, well, she's writing them, but I built a write like Brian GPT. love it.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, have you been playing with four Oh, yes. Yeah. Crazy.
00:20:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Huh. I've just been talking to it. Yeah.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the ability to train it, how fast it gets like the copy that is spent after I had a few just like it gave me just so lame. And then I talked to it three more times. And then when it's been out, I was like, ah, that's unbelievable what it got to anyway. Okay. So you are Brian GPT.
00:20:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, Brian GPT. And it gets us about 80% there, which I was telling Brian is like, I think that's a huge help. Because he's a little down on it at first. But that's just, know, he's he's always down on things at first. And so I'm just like, you know, this is doing some heavy lifting and like you can just edit it. so now he's all on board. He likes it. And he gave some feedback, and we put that into the GPT as well, and once I explain that to him, it's like whatever you don't like, just tell me, and I'll go back and I'll add that as training to the GPT. But yeah, coming off the last break through advertising bootcamp, we're in a bit of a lull in Titan's world, just in terms of promotions, the next one coming up is over-deliver bootcamp in July. So, starting to plan and think that out. And yeah, I'm not working on anything really big for Brian right now, right? The second, and then the tea business is about to... to launch, so we've got John wrote the really great sales letter that's going to go in as an upsell behind his offer. I always keep forgetting the name of his offer for some reason. It's people signing up for an exercise nutrition program, and he has like 5,000 buyers coming through that every month through ClickBank. So we're going to put this tea offer as the upsell to that flow. And he's already spoken with one other big a click bank marketer who she she has something in the health and wellness. It's not fitness, but she's got something he was telling me and health and wellness and he was telling her about the the tea and she she wants to put the the upsell on her flow as well after we get it up and get some numbers. And then apparently John's got another click bank offer that that is like second second tier in the sense of like volume it's got it it's still got thousands of buyers but I don't think it's like 5,000 buyers maybe a couple thousand a month. And total coming through that offer and it's in the health and health and wellness space. And he wants to, once we get this up on the first upsell, he wants to put it in to that flow. But we've got the letter, and then I've got the inventory and where we just got, I had my designer put labels, design different labels for the packaging. So we're looking at those now. I wrote a conversion letter that will ride with when Pete, so our downsell is if somebody isn't with the 30-day supply of the tea, then we'll downsell them to a sample, like a free plus shipping offer. And so I wrote the letter and the order form that will ride with that sample. And then I'll also have a letter that goes to anybody who signs up. for the membership or just the third-day supply, but it would all be kind of built off of this letter that I wrote for the sample. And what I did for that was I took the letter that Lee and I wrote and I put it into chat GPT and I had it and then I told it a little bit about what we were doing and he and he and chat GPT um uh rewrote it and it's it's great. Like it did a really great job. I you know I got a few tweaks to it but yeah it's fantastic. And so I'm really excited to be re-re-launching this tea business and...
00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How amazing that you even feel that way about it though. just have to think about that. It's it's crazy. No, I'm serious. I have you.
00:26:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
to think about that. I know.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should just the the choices that you've made, Chris. I you can't see the whole you in here.
00:26:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm smiling. Yeah.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the choices that you've made, the liberation, the lack of desperation, like you're just in charge of everything. You're not controlled by anyone. You're not a victim of anyone. You don't have to tolerate anyone. You are positioned as peer or all of that was created deliberately. have gone through a process of systematically shifting the dynamics in everything. And you didn't have to get rid of and start over anything to like everything to make that happen. So Bogdan, gone, who her gone. But you didn't have to get rid not how normal people operate. This is not the average general life. This is not average by any means. Most people will never get to this level of power in their life where they can dictate the dynamic, but you're dictating benevolently. It isn't with a desire to oppress. It's with a desire to be free.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and not to use your freedom and power over somebody else.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You seek to bless. And so everything is motivated in a benevolent way, which is to me divine and God like, obviously we're not perfect and we can't be like him, but we can do our best. these relationships that you have, these people that you're working with, this work that you're doing and this piece that you have within that allows you to show up as a dad the way that you get to and as a husband the way that you get to. All of this was done because you wrestled yourself first. You wrestled your fears. You wrestled your insecurities. wrestled your choices and your decisions. And then you also wrestled the opponents, like Bogdan likely. It doesn't mean that they like, like, would be was an adversary. But an adversary to your freedom and your peace. He was his choices were however you want to call it, right?
00:29:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yes.
00:29:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that you are now at a point where you're just like, I can't really get rid of tea fast enough. And I'm like, but it's an asset. What can we do? Well, you know, maybe don't get rid of it yet. And then you ponder it a little bit and you're like, well, I could cut it down to this and it just kind of run itself. And then it expanded again. So it you reduced and then you marinated a little bit and just kind of let it maintain and then conserved energy like a battery filling back up like a solar battery. And now look at what's about to happen. all of that is you and you almost didn't have this partnership because they wanted to. Um, dictate a level that you're like, no, that's not going to happen. But instead of just renovating it and having your energy, you just be like, no, or rather than capitulating, because you're like, I, I'm not going to do this.
00:30:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't want to do marketing. Right.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, no, this is how it's going to be. Take it or read it and you meant it and that energy comes through. It comes through people know when somebody means it.
00:30:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so I'm just like, look at the boy.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just it's killing it because all of this has now compounding power. Yeah, massive compounding power, because you have alignment with these powerful relationships who are, you know, paying you $5,000 a month, Brian didn't pay you that well, Brian still doesn't really pay you that well in terms of. just showing up to do a job, right? for everything that you've brought to him, he doesn't pay you that well. In my opinion, it doesn't, like, I think everyone else is showing you more respect. And, you know, your relationship started with Brian is different. It's not really an apples to apples kind of thing. And it is about picking on Brian at all. My point is the elevated relationships that are coming that will get to compound in the way that they bring a financial return to you. But that also brings an energetic return to you and gives you more resources with which you can build and create. And that's pretty powerful. While at the same time that's happening, you've gotten tedious stuff off your plates and have an operating at a higher level, plus technology just zoomed and just went nuts for our chat dbt4o. Just imagine what's going to be available in six months from now. But nothing to be afraid of. Nobody's going to replace anybody and anything. Well, some people will go to a place, but for anybody that works strategically and understands leverage and levers, these are just levers, massive, powerful levers. And if you rather than come from place it and just go cruise control, right?
00:32:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Because that's where you die.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just go, okay, how can I leverage what's new? How can I leverage what's new? And just kind of put it into your foundational and fundamental system and process. It's going to be amazing. Like the conversation we're going to have from a year from now. Crazy, crazy, in a good way. Yeah.
00:32:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, you know, it's like I was thinking this week, I don't know if it was this morning or yesterday morning, but it's like, I'm really excited about this tea project. And I started, started dreaming a little bit, just thinking, like, man, what if this like, what if this works? And I usually, I, uh, I try, like, whenever I do that, like the voice in my head will kick in and be like, don't get too excited, like just don't get too excited. And, um, and I do that kind of just self protection, you know, I'm like, if it doesn't work, like I don't costs. Yeah. And Brian's that way. I've gotten a lot of that from him, as well. And, but at the same time, like, I was like, it's really cool. If this, if this worked, and there's, there's a model out there with this guy, Charles Livingston, who started Life Boost Coffee. And he's, he's now, he just launched a, uh, a line of teas. And so was like, and John is, he's good buddies with Charles and actually had a call with him a couple months ago saying I'm starting a tea business and Charles gave him some advice about what they learned when they were growing life-boost coffee and so I feel like we're following this like there's space in the market for this and we just got to, I don't know, I saw it work in to Lee's audience and we just got to figure out the right way to talk about it and I think we've got a good initial first step to put out there and I love that we're starting with doing upsells, going right after people, right after they buy in a sort of related... angle, I guess, and AI has been tremendously helpful on the research side of things. I started using this perplexity.ai because it gives you sites sources and links to But I just go in there and be like, give me some studies on how Joglin helps with weight loss.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know you can go do that with chat GPT-40 and get a great answer. Oh, really?
00:35:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, yeah.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll try that. I'm pretty much canceling everything now.
00:35:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. yeah, it's like, this is amazing. Isn't so much faster and so yeah, I'm really excited. I had about tea and I think like, man, wouldn't it be cool if, because like doing this stuff with, you know, consulting with Tim, like it's, it's fine, like I'm learning. It's good to practice that muscle. I'm writing a lot of copy and it's for a different audience. And I'm getting paid well, which I can just, you know, me a big shovel or a decent shovel to pay down my debt and all that good stuff. But, you know, it's, it's still like being dependent on somebody else and, I mean, some make sense same with, with Brian, but the one thing with, with Brian is that I am really looking forward to having this event that we're going to do in January. Like, I think that's going to bring in a lot of new memory. first accelerator. so I am pumped for that. And by that time, you know, the T will be out there and have that run in and be really cool.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it could be really cool. it. When's the last time you will actually hold on to something that you're I did it. Oh, when did you update it?
00:37:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Last week.
00:37:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're looking at the wrong one. Oh, yeah, we had a 2024 and I don't know where it is. Let's see. There it is. All right, let's see. So aside, good. And then where is your, let's see. I'm gonna put your for like paying off your deck kind of thing in this schedule.
00:38:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, so that I've got all the cards there and then below I've got them all listed out.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But have you, because they look mostly empty for like, I see city for me, but what you should do is put the projected what you want to drop on those for those months coming up.
00:38:29 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, well, I guess that line 18 set aside that 3k, it's for B of A. Okay. So I mean, I guess.
00:38:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there anything else that needs to get paid on those months?
00:38:51 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes, I'm glad you said that because I was just thinking about this. Just the, so I need the. update the business expense number because that needs to include, I have one card that's paying business expenses that comes out every month and then, so that would be off the top before taxes. So I think that 1800 would go to, I just paid it, was 1100, and that's the minimum payment on the, it's the biz, biz affire.
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's what I think you should do, and I think you should do it with whatever's rough idea in your head right now. But do you want to drop on any of these accounts for these next few months? So you have a more accurate idea of what there really is to work with. Because it helps with the surprises or the disappointment of a letdown kind of at the end. We're like, that's not as good as that looks right there. Or it could be like, oh, actually, well, I've got this to work with. So here's what I want to do now. And maybe it's paying down more. Maybe it's investing in something, whatever. So when you end, and it helps you get to those targets that you want to get with your finances faster when you put all of that in there. I'll have this, but I'll have my investment account. I'll have everything, all in a snapshot. So I look at the end of month projection knowing. like, this is the money that's growing, this is the money that's like investments growing, and then the revenue from business, and then here's the personal expenses and the businesses. I put everything together so I have an overall snapshot of what all the finances are. Since I don't, I like, I have a company, but I don't have a company, you know what I mean? I have that structure, so eventually, you know, like I have hired three people, I'm probably gonna hire a couple more for my own business, so this year I'm definitely gonna have to structure differently and have separate, completely separate finances, I haven't been doing that up until now, so it's really been super helpful for me to have everything on one page to have an idea, especially when I was first trying, when I was trying to get out of debt, that was huge for me to be able to see everything in a single line and be really confident about how much I had. how much I would have like what what work was coming doing obviously you don't know for sure but I've always had a pretty consistent revenue amount so um doing that just the piece of mind that comes from with the clarity but the energy from like yes I'm here and so if I go sell another thing it's extra money to go do this with or that with or whatever you know is that all I'm just one sheet or do you have multiple sheets so I have a I have a tab it's called monthly expenses and so that's everything that comes out and I have it color coded for business or personal just so I know and so what I do is I copy and paste that every month to my monthly budget and so like as each week I update it I'm like okay all of those charges have come out here's what's left that's an alignment with what it predicted I would have by the end of the the month, I just keep tabs on that and make sure that, you know, I'm just looking at it once a week and making sure everything comes out. So, and then on that tab that has a summary of all the things, that's where I make edits. But my main tab, my summary tab, like you have right here, what I do is I have that monthly stuff, so in the beginning of the month, I copy and paste the whole month playlist, right? So it has my variable and my fixed expenses, fixed expenses are, well, they're on the top, but then I end up sorting it by the date that they get drafted, just so that I have it in a linear kind of, what's the word, timeline, chronological order. But then they're also color coded too, and at the bottom it adds it all up as a summary of these are the things that are going to get drafted out. And that gets taken away from the monthly total of what I know is going to come in business. revenue-wise. My investment accounts don't get included in that.
00:44:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They're there so I can see it, but they don't get into my cash accounts.
00:44:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They just stay there. They don't get touched. Then at the top, I have a column for all of my different bank accounts, savings, checking, different banks. I do put the investment accounts in there, so I have a total, but it's not the total that everything gets subtracted from, if that makes sense. It gets its own total of all my assets, and then there's the this is the monthly budget total that everything can be debited from, and so that's the thing that changes every month. So I do have everything in there on a single page. The income prediction is its own tab, so I have an expense tab and an income tab. And I have an income for every year, and I just create because I don't have a ton of people or ton of offers, right? But either way, it wouldn't be too much different than this. It'd be a little bit longer. It's really long, but so every time there's the monthly, I used to have the group stuff and I used to have different products, which is about to return. So I would put the totals based on either the client or the product total and report those weekly or as whenever I did the update. So for clients, it's once a month. If it's going to be a product, I'll probably do it once a month total with that. Again, that's how I used to do it. And then so I got the monthly total, but it's going top to bottom and it's a really long. I don't know how many rows it is. And at the bottom, and I just do it for the whole year and one in one. tab and then it totals it at the bottom and so I've got an income tab, I've got an expense tab and the front tab, this one is my summary tab where I just copy and paste the expenses. The income is just a formula that adds up everything from my income tab so that it's calculating in real time what is coming in and what's going out is it's always right on alignment with what I have, it's always within my budget. If something changes and a new expense is coming, I just go insert a cell into the summary tab and it does that so yeah it's I could give you and I feel like I template for let's see what you know. what that looks like if you wanted to do it so that you could just kind of track. So like it's it's all the different types of expenses, school expenses, kid expenses, soccer stuff, whatever, all the personal stuff, and then all of the business stuff. So I have a really accurate idea of what's coming out every month. And I always have more money than I thought I did because I try to put in that buffer, especially for groceries, clothes, you know, things like that. Right. Yeah, but that way there was just no negative surprises. It was always a good surprise. Like, oh, I have got more money than I thought it did. And then it gets to a point where you don't necessarily have to check it every week, but it's still a good practice to do because you want to make sure that there's something didn't pop up that you weren't paying attention to.
00:47:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that'd be great. I think you you probably shared either that or maybe earlier version of that. with me in the past, let's see maybe, but but yeah, I'd love to see it and see if I could because I'm going in here and updating this and it's been helpful. So yeah, if there was way to to make it even more detailed, they'll begin.
00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. I've got it open. I have a template, but I would change it a little bit to be more like the format that I have. It's similar. Okay. Yeah.
00:48:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, I mean, you could zero everything out and send me what you use if you.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's basically like that, but I might be able to make it just more like for for what you have. So then it's more plug and play for you. Okay. So let's see, let's look at this. I mean, because let's see, so June doesn't have a lot of wiggle around. You're at the end of May is that like what you have in profits after everything, including paying things down.
00:49:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, no, I've got more than that. I put 11 grand for lights on cost because we're doing a trip. Guys up to New York. So, but I know right now I've got um, let's see, let me just pay, let me do it. Yeah, I checked in there, I had 29 grand in my account, it's the end of the month, then I just took out five on a, on my southwest car, because that was the, because I have expenses that are tight expenses on that. And so that's part of what Brian pays me, I just pay that towards, so, okay, so we're down to like 22, probably about 20 grand sitting in there now, not 12, and I'm not going to be taking out 8 grand between now and the end of the month. So I think instead of that 12 that's going to carry over, it's going to be more like. It'll end up being more like 17.
00:51:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you've got the live payout for TxL, and then that'll happen again in October?
00:51:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:51:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You had a happening in October.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you haven't mentioned profit partners at all? Yes. you working on it?
00:51:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, I'm not. It just kind of went to the back burner for me after doing that. But after doing the cohort, I didn't really like, I mean, I would do the cohort differently. So that's not like a reason to not do it, but, and I stopped, have an email my list in a while, somebody asked me about that, they're like, I haven't heard from you, and I wrote back, was like, I don't. I don't know, I don't know what I'm leading people toward, because the things that I'm excited about are, you know, the things I'm working on, and the, the, the business and things like that. And it's like, I, I don't know, like, I, I just kind of lost. energy around building my list, mailing my list, lost the energy around profit partners. And I think when I because I started, I mean, started working on the T back early and beginning of the year. And if I were to hold up, you know, option one of having like owning a business, it's generating revenue that's, you know, product based like the T versus doing something that's more personality based like profit partner. I'm I'm going to go for the product base one.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what if what you do is make it less hands-on? Like it doesn't have to be a bootcamp and instead it's just a series of videos and it's mostly self-paced and it's lower cost but it's just an engine that runs and maybe once a quarter you do a live call, live training and it's kind of a big deal, you know, like really get like some speakers on there, maybe it's like a four-hour kind of event but it can be in alignment with other things that you're doing, other people that you're working with so it's not a separate thing that takes separate energy. It's a it's a duplicated repurposed type of activity right because you're already talking to these people, they're already in your share and you can be like, hey, let's talk about the stuff that we're doing and let's show people how they can do it. And, you know, like, there's probably an angle because there's value in it. And I think you liked talking about it. I just think you, and this is the thing I found in my own self, a start, stop, start, stop. And I do it with a lot of different things, fitness regimens, different types of habits and activities, because I know that I'm pulled to it and I'm called to it. But when I start to do it, the path isn't super clear. And so I think sometimes God just shows me things so that I'm ready, so that when the time is right, I'll know it and recognize it because I've been thinking about it. And my subconscious has been able to work on it. And he's been attracting other people into my sphere and attracting me into theirs. like, there's all these things that go into it. And so maybe, so in the beginning, the burden was kind of I had have to have a product to make my own money so I'm not reliant just on TxL. Well now you've got T and now you have a consulting job that you're kind of doing and liking and you can do another one or two and easily make another $10,000 where with Trad GBT you wouldn't be spending a ton of time because you know how to train it really really fast on their stuff. So everything has changed but this is still something that you probably want to be able to give back. You have always been drawn to helping other people be successful in their own businesses being free, being liberated from not being taken advantage of by people that they're working for that they're making rich and they're not getting paid anything. So maybe it's a change of schedule and burden and the way that you package everything and how you offer it and you just pivot kind of an adjust the way that you're delivering it the way that you're selling it and even your price point like if you don't need it to work you don't need it to be a certain price point and so you know what I mean like maybe that's something to consider so that now it's not a well I have to do this and I feel resentment because of it and it's a I get to do this I'm going to do it my way just like every other deal that you've done right yeah with John and his son John right the tea guy yeah John John John you've you've adjusted the partnership with Brian every conversation that you're having you're like okay well here's what I'm willing to do it's on the table, take it or leave it. And you can do the same thing with profit partners, but if you're feeling like, okay, they can't pay that much because they really don't have good arrangements yet. They don't have good partnerships yet. not, really they have a lot of mindset issues probably like you did about how they even positioned themselves. So this is a very long runway.
00:58:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's the biggest problem with this.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not really a problem, but it is in terms of conversion. Is there is a long runway of overcoming mental hurdles of, I can't do this. I don't know how to package it. I don't know how to whatever. And so you could come up with a 90 day email sequence with chat GPT. So like you could go take all of your recordings, all of your transcripts. then, so this is what I've done. And I love the memory because I could start a whole new chat and it still remembers everything I've told it and other things. So, give it all of that content and say, this is my philosophy. This is my goal. This is what I want to teach people. Here's the problem that I know is that, you know, for example, it took me years to get to the point where I can confidently just say, look, this is what I'm going to do, take it or leave it. But on top of that, you also sharpened your saw. You also got to the point where you're like, I'm very good at what I do. You you can write copy, amazing copy. don't have to write, wait for Brian, Brian's barely going to touch and tweak anything you write anymore. So it wasn't just, you know, your mindset, it was also your skill set. Yeah. So you tell chat TPT, like, these are the issues that people are going to have and you think about all the issues they're going to have. And maybe, you know, at two o'clock in the morning, you're up, you're going to the bathroom, think of like, whatever. Don't let me forget it. Let's add this to the material. Let's add this to to the philosophy and make sure that we leave it into the content and I've been talking to it like that and it will weave it into the content and say oh this will fit perfect in this chapter and we'll add this lead magnet we could do this and I'm like oh yeah let's go yeah so you know you could say I need a 90 day or maybe it's a 120 day and then you recycle it right thing that just hit all of these bullet points consistently and tells them this is what you need to know and let's make it anecdotal which is not really great at coming up with anecdotes without training and even with training it's not very great at anecdotes I don't think not the way that I would write not the way that you would write but it can it definitely can be trained better and I'm we're getting there anyway but but then you can just redo it every 90 to 120 days and you know in four months maybe you get the next level and say, hey, do you feel like you're ready for the next step? And let them either unsubscribe, stay in and they recycle through the next thing, the same thing over and over again. Or at some point, they raise their hand and say, I'm interested in more. And it's either buy this thing, or now you're self selected to more. So I'm going to give you the next level of mindset. And eventually, they're either going to unsubscribe or buy. Because the what you should be doing for a list hygiene is getting rid of people who never open your emails, right? So that's what I would do. And it's very low level. And the training could all be video plus you want to have a but if they do, and you get an extra two, three, four, $5,000 a month, talk. talking about profit partners one on one, which is, to me, the thing that would energize you, and also potentially bring you your own profit partner, because who knows who they're connected to? Um, you know, maybe that's another way that you could do it where it's not draining anymore. And with the automations of chat TPT, may I not allow work?
01:02:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm open to something like that. It's, um, yeah, I'm open to something like that. But it, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like, like, not, I'm not drawn to put energy into it, like right at this juncture.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, anybody anything around profit partners?
01:02:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do I know?
01:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, then we'll just let it sit, you don't You don't have to do anything, but if you if you get inclined and you think about it And then you can just start building a framework and chat GPT I haven't even run into limitations since 4o came out.
01:03:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Mm-hmm.
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not running out of topians Didn't tell me I couldn't upload X amount of things I've had to continue like a couple times, but that's it because it just goes so long. It's so amazing. Yeah I'm just like that's a huge upgrade. Yeah, amazing for $20 a month.
01:03:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like that's crazy.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know So it looks like okay, I What are you and Seth and Brian working on anything?
01:03:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not yet It's balls in my court to outline The RFM what Seth and I talked about doing was taking people through I guess his email process to the outcome will be to have a, to show them how to find the best people on their list and then we're going to give them an offer to run to their list. So, what were a, a structure of an offer that they would plug in, basically, and we would sell TXL this way because we would say, basically we've, we've shown you how to find the very best people on your list. Now we're giving you, we're just saying, run this, run this offer, run this offer structure, making money, and use that money to join TxL. like pay for TxL before you join type of thing.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so it's just in my court to finish outlining that, show it to Brian, or I want to show it to Seth first, but that's where it sits. And then Seth told me, I guess you were on the call, actually now that I think about it with this as a hypnosis.
01:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, it's kind of self hypnosis therapy, and it combines other existing therapies, like CBT cognitive therapy. Yeah, so he's working on an offer for them right now.
01:05:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We had a sales call with them Friday.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. And they kind of balked at the price a little bit for a dent for you. But it was a big price. And I told Seth that he should do But because he's making big impact in big companies, and every time it's blowing them away and he's charging peanuts basically for something that's gonna add a whole lot to their bottom line. And he's at the point where he needs to build a team and make some investments so that I've got something to work with for him. But also it's pretty powerful. And I wanna see it in more people's businesses that actually have transformational offerings. So like the way that you teach people you personally, but also in TXL, how to be better leaders, be better persuaders, move people from where they are to where they have already said they wanna go through copy, through persuasion, through buying this thing, which is a transformational thing. TXL is a transformational thing. You come in and you improve your skills, which relates to, you know, correlates to and translates to better revenue. But also more confidence. And more confidence brings more energy. Just it feels better. You know, you're happier when you're more confident. If you're self-doubting, you're unhappy. That's just how it is. So with the way that he writes things, compared with the automations that take that psychology and that writing on a schedule with behavioral-based responses, it's like consulting and coaching somebody in person on a day to day. It feels very different.
01:07:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
feels so much more personal.
01:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's architecture and it's engineering. this is not how anything is really running right now. And, but if a person wants to be leading and wants to be really supportive, and they don't want to show up every day to do it because we also have our own lives, this is the solution. And I want to see it in businesses because if you put all those things together, that means you've got more people with more skills and more confidence going out and doing their things. You know what they don't have? They don't have the fear that the government's going to take over them or whatever person. They're less afraid. They're more powerful than more independent. That goes with so many of the other values that we have is wanting to be a free people, self-sustaining, independent, whatever. Free parents, happier parents, stronger, more confident parents that can go home and teach our kids how to do all of these things. So it um but nobody else is doing it so I'm definitely like whatever you can do to get that in there and start seeing it happen I think that you have the ability to go take the same kind of concept and put it into other things like once you see how it works you'll I know you have this skill technically and copy and persuasion rise to go and do something like this in other things ethically obviously not stealing the formula but it's the type of thing that it's going to get out there you know and you use it and repurpose it but there's abundance Seth will get what he needs and wants plenty um but once you see it I think it can really change the way that you operate and really leverage things for you because you'll look at that and go this is this is what I do you with profit partnering this is how I walk somebody through an experience and I don't have to be there for them but they they're like I'm in love with Chris because he has taught me everything He's my coach. He's my mentor. He's my teacher. He changed my life. And you're like, yeah, wrote those emails once.
01:10:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, you're not going to see really how it all works until you, you watch it. He built inside of something. So if you get the framework, this is leverage that you will benefit over and over again. That the Titans can as well, but that you and Brian will, you know, share the cost or however that works. Yeah. It'll be something you can even potentially do with teeth and that the transformation is a person who doesn't know a lot about how the nervous system works, right? The digestive system or whatever. And so you walk them through these things and like if they raise their hand and say, look, I want to be the healthiest person. And I can't, well, if you're gonna do that, you can't just take supplements. You have to understand how these things work. So let's walk you through an experience where you learn all of these things, and then you make some decisions, well guess what those decisions are? Buying your products, but it's buying your products because you've done the research and you know that if they've got these things going on, this is the ideal thing for them. So it's persuasion, I wouldn't call it manipulation because the manipulation is getting somebody to do something that they would not do that is against their values. But they got twisted into doing something against their values, tricked basically. To me, you know, that's what it is. Persuading somebody to do something they wanna do and just continuing to encourage them and given the information that they need to do that, you know, that's ethical and good. I think that that's what this is for. So anyway, this is my pitch and plug for, get that. Don't overwork yourself, know, if you're busy and now is not a good time. That's one thing But I see powerful leverage in you seeing what he's done. I mean, he has not been great about Explaining how powerful it is and being clear about it But he's like in the same way that when you went through BAM Your copy just just Yeah, he has been having that transformation as we've been working because we've been working together It's been 13 months now and he could not tell me anything clearly and now he can put it in just a few words and a few paragraphs Which it used to take him hours, and I still didn't know everything I needed to know. Yeah, so Once now that he's getting clear, it's it's gonna be coming out and it's it's hopefully gonna get some traction because this is This is the thing many of us have been needing who don't want to be tied to the job, tied to the community, tied to social media, tied to email, tied to customer support, but also know that a person needs to be reminded, needs to be held accountable, needs to be given bite-sized pieces all the way through. Nobody wanted to write all those email sequences. So this aligning with where we're at with chat TPT. Forget about it. I'm telling you, God is like, babies, I know you're tired, I got this for you.
01:13:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's on my list. I make just slow process on it, so it's not an empty document somewhere. just require some thinking. Simple. I mean, I guess it is a simple topic, but.
01:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could I return to you.
01:14:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what I know. What else? What questions do you have? Let it ask you questions because that's what you and I do. I ask you questions and you answer it. And you're like, well, that actually brings up a good idea. Let me think about this. And then it evolves.
01:14:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Right.
01:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't let that ABT replace me because I'm better, but you know, but you can do it. It can it can probe and do something. And matter of fact, the way that my copy evolved was that and it was crazy because. So I went through and I was making a lead magnet for. Principles and priorities. And I had just told it the importance of. That the reason it's, it's the first. concept in the first pillar that I teach is because values, principles and values, they inform priority and priority informs what gets done and what gets measured. And that obviously is going to inform what we actually have and so then it goes through and it goes the secret way to like how I'm going to go read it. I'm just going to do this normal wrap up. Someone is just crazy. Tick tock marketing strategies is where we ended up writing this I think. I gave it bunch of notes after that. going Oh, you know what actually I sent it to some of that. But it was, yeah, no, I really, I do really want to tell you this show this. I had to scroll up past the billions of conversations that we have. Okay, it was after our ball of reality. never mind. I'm just priority. So no one cares. That's how I can find it because I told it no one cares. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. Okay, so it wrote this. It said title, the surprising key to unlocking your business potential, how core values transform your priorities. And I was like, nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's not good at all. What people care about is actually getting traction and momentum in their business and they feel stuck. I'm pretty sure you have enough understanding about human emotion to be able to write better than this. What questions do you need to ask yourself? People are writing to make sure that you are writing something that will evoke powerful emotion So it asked the questions six of them. What are the primary pain points of my audience? Then it asked another question, and then what emotions are tied to the pain point? What transformation are they seeking? What's the immediate benefit they will gain from my solution? How can I create urgency in the sense of importance? What proof of credibility can I provide and then? The new copy it did not ask you questions. It did not answer it It answered itself and then wrote the copy without any further interaction for me The new title unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack Introduction feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks announcing progress. You're not alone Most business owners struggle with the same issues feeling like they're spinning their rails without getting any traction The good news is there's a simple yet powerful solution that can change everything in just minutes So I have taught it that stuff but it doesn't matter because in the past I taught it so many things and it won't pull from it and it won't take the psychology that I had taught it and it didn't put it into copy like it just it took so much training and this I like what I just told you like nobody cares blah blah whatever I would go 20 rounds and still not get anything great but what it did right there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve word headline unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack um I will read the rest of that next is feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks oh mama keep reading you know what I mean mm-hmm so um but where it started where is it started like unlocking your priorities give her a brat there else I'm out there
01:19:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
that's awesome.
01:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, simple turning and oh, so the conversation, that's all I was saying, like to your outline for RFM.
01:19:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is how I talked to it. And, know, I don't it doesn't care about its feelings, but I want to do it was important. It wasn't being rude. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's the truth. And so I said, that's not a good headline at all. What people care about it. And then what questions do you need to ask yourself to make sure that you evoke powerful emotion? Because I told it, people purchase and make decisions based off of emotion. So if you give it the principles that you know that copy has to have and say, remember this, always remember this. Never forget this. That type of thing.
01:19:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It will start remembering.
01:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you can say, okay, based on what you already know, what questions do you have that you need to know before knowing that this is something you need? Or what questions do you think my buyer has that they need to have a clear answer to before they purchase? And then it will give you some questions, you're like, oh yeah, you're right. So I need to go put this in there. I'm telling you, it will walk you through the whole process and the way that we have done in some sessions, in copywriting sessions, you'll get there, but you can stop and start whenever you want to. And you can say, I forgot what we were working on, remind me, and it will tell you the last conversation you had anywhere in any of the conversations.
01:20:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Wow, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm definitely going to do that for the SARS-Fins thing. That's great.
01:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I suppose you probably had enough of talking to me after I let you go.
01:20:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's good to catch up. Um, yeah, I mean, maybe we could, uh, connect like this or like once a month or something.
01:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love that, but I would, it would really be great to me to just at least be able to touch faces at least every couple of weeks. would rather just kind of weakly like, Hey, this is what's good. Like, tell me the wins or if something is stressing you out, I really would like to know about that. Like I'm so if we did the, like this is the offer I'm wanting to test and try and I think won't be hard, especially because people like you tend to just not say anything. So it's really not taking my time when I would give it, um, but especially if something stressing you out, just get it out and just be like this. And then maybe I can ask you questions, maybe I can give you encouragement, just be here. Sometimes it's just nice to have somebody that knows your business and knows you.
01:21:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Just really that.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also if you have a win, it's something that will feed into whatever else we're doing because that win is definitely going to have relationship to other work that you're doing. So if you would just take a second, a few minutes, whatever, to pop in each week, if I'm like, how's it going? Tell Tina, what's up? Boy, I've been investing you for six and a half years also.
01:22:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's not one way. I know, I know.
01:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
care about you. I want to see, I want to know that you're okay in doing well. And I want to celebrate with you when you're doing awesome, but you are doing awesome.
01:22:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hear you. I get it.
01:22:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. I'm not great about it. It's always the calls were always helpful because it's like on the calendar. Yeah. Like, I got to be there, the, you know, voice notes or whatever it is. It's like, I'll do that. Well, let's put that in minute.
01:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can put it on the calendar. Hey, checking with Tina.
01:22:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So you see that pop up and you're like, okay, Tina gets five minutes. I'm going to give her an update. can do that on our Wednesday time slot.
01:23:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay well then I will put that on there and it's an invite so both of us and I'm gonna look at that and go I don't see my message.
01:23:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine.

I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?

Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, Mark. You're crazy. That's exactly what he ate.
01:07:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, your employees are gonna actually have to do tasks, weekly, gasp.
01:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, that is the issue. Anyway, okay. That is awesome. I forget what you realized you figured out, but I know you figured it out, and you won't forget when it comes to what you figured out was supervised.
01:08:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, do you mind? Yeah, totally. I need to build our own.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because I can go back to my notes and get that if you need a reminder.
01:08:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I got it.
01:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, sir. Okay, don't forget ideas for like a gift basket. That's pretty much going to be all about Denise. We'll probably figure out something for you too.
01:08:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, It's the other D&D call.
01:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got two air pods and you probably drop them in the dog bowl.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, but they're the ones that everyone's complaining about. No, actually, that's already broke.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on another set.
01:08:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mary is using the ones that you got using the one.
01:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's one that works.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think I dropped them in the dog bowl. eat the pieces of a shelf. I told that to Josh amazing. Oh, I just got air pods and like be gentle.
01:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't forget to think about the Denise basket and then, you know, have a great weekend, Labor Day weekend.
01:09:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, thanks. Oh, I think all the music I get canceled, maybe I'll probably all of them, except Mark.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
01:09:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I meant. I don't, I don't, yeah, yeah.
01:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not coming that way.
01:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God. I mean, it's a base. It's a basis meeting, but it's really not inviting you, but yeah, totally. Okay. You know, I'll be late.

Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.
00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone
There's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.
00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Are you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?
00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.
00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

> 00:00:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Good morning.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:07 - Michael Fujinaka
How are you? It really well.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's your sleep?
00:00:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I'm just putting that up here. Could have been better in the last couple of days, but. Yeah. Well, can I show you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
please. All right.
00:00:23 - Michael Fujinaka
You look exactly like your picture.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's good. I guess. No, I'm not. I haven't probably haven't done video. I feel really loud today. I don't know. It's just equity in my room. Oh, that's good. Actually, also, I was just thinking I would really like this to be a. Could you send these to me Sunday night so that Monday I have them? Because that's going to be an accountability test. Yeah. So you get one time to fail and then we install consequences. I understood.
00:01:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Are you able to see my screen right now?
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes I am. So I'm looking at the dates on the ora ringer at the top. I see. Yeah, and you sent those to me. So deep sleep. I'd be very interested to see, I know you broke your Apple Watch, but if you end up replacing it, I'd be very interested to compare the data. None of them are perfectly reliable. I feel like if you really want to dial into this and I'm a data person, so figuring out the way that you like to see the data, the way that it makes the most sense to you. don't like this layout. I'll Also, so the SleepWatch app that I use for Apple calls it restful sleep versus, well, so that light sleep, deep sleep is a little bit different. But I'd be interested to see how it compares. like I use sleep cycle and sleep watched. And then there's also Apple Health data and they all report differently even though they're using the same mechanism to record data to report the data differently. So there are algorithms for how they calculate the data is obviously different. So I like to look at the multiple data points and say, okay, which one makes the most sense in the correlation to how I feel and what my experience is that day. I still tend to look at all of them anyway, because I'm not and I think that you'd be okay with this too. Like my fiance, he can't look at this stuff because he'll get anxiety over it and he'll just obsess about it. And there are people who just like, they look at that and they forgot about it. I don't. I look at it and go it's information and it's probably not fully accurate and how I feel is probably a better indicator. But anyway, if you're really going to dial this in, I would recommend whatever data points you're willing to acquire apps, Apple Watch versus ordering that type of thing. And then let's have about a month, but also hear about the whole new thing into the mix with the baby. That'll be interesting to watch what happened. how is Esther, by the way, that I meant to be like, that's the first thing I want to know.
00:03:55 - Michael Fujinaka
What's she doing? She unfortunately got COVID two days on Friday. So I was. I had not had to. We shifted what we were doing so I watched Emi the last couple of days and then Emi got COVID yesterday. So we actually might tomorrow. They're actually telling us not to come to the hospital tomorrow. we might actually just push the due date back to 40 weeks instead of 39.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So it's Her mom's here now helping us. She also has COVID now.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm kind of holed up in this room today where I'll be working. How does your family do with it? Like it's not the same for everyone. For me, it was devastating, but for other people, we haven't touched them.
00:04:43 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, yeah. mean, it's, it's kind of business as usual. It's COVID. just not that it's not that potent for us right now.
00:04:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was last time.
00:04:52 - Michael Fujinaka
So yeah, like my wife and her mom, they all cook. I mean, Emi is running around and laughing, even though she's not. So yeah, it's business as usual, except I just need more careful. At first, I wasn't careful because I was like, well, I'm not going to get it anyways. But I'm not going to have got it yet. So now we're like, well, we don't want to start your timer right now. Like if I get it, then I get it for 10 days, I think that. So now we're like, okay, well, maybe I should be careful now too. So we'll see, I still might get it.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to test this morning, actually. Yeah, business as usual sort of. Well, that's good. It was I have, as I've been hospitalized, I told you, I think hospitalized with it four times for seven to 10 days, and my oxygen was max levels and I have narrow airways, my right lungs almost like so COVID was a big deal for me. And then it totally messed up my digestive system. But it's so interesting how it's different for everyone. But anyway, learned a lot of healing over that too. Okay, so sleep stuff. Oh, We're not sharing screen anymore. I'm like, what happened? I can't see it anymore. It's good. So Sunday nights just email me send those images and your journal, I would really like to see. So I'm just doing it in like a written format. Well, you can take a picture of it if you want to, or you can use an app like whatever works. But for if we're going to even talk about this, then I want to really talk about it because otherwise it makes no sense. And so food, exercise, sunshine, sleep, mood, and anything that you might have done differently in the day that would impact that you noticed. And how you feel about the sleep, your energy that day. Let's do scale of one to 10 on productivity mood. Um, me highlight this too. So I give it note. Productivity, mood, energy, and kind of notice when you start to fade out a little bit throughout the day, let's check that. And if we watched that for a few weeks, again, wild card with the baby, like this is a whole different thing. But you still should learn some of the patterns of your body and what things make the biggest impact and what things, you know, really aren't. And then, then you'll have, you'll be aware of your own levers. So if, for example, some days, there's a lot that I need to get done. my, and I'm sleepy, I'm not well functioning, and it might be eight o'clock at night, and I might use caffeine, because I'm in the middle of deep brainwork. my cognitive function will improve with that. But my sleep will be so sacrificed. But if if the priority for that day, and I have the lead way the next day to be able to take a nap or something like that, in order to, because also I'm a finisher, so I need to complete something. Otherwise, I won't go to sleep, that those loops will be open to my brain, and I won't be able to rest and relax anyway. So since I know my sleep is already going to be disrupted, I'm just going to power through. But the next day, I will get almost nothing done brain level wise. I may be able to get some things done physically. So then I'll do some housework. That might be when I spend a little bit more time just sitting outside relaxing, because I'm soaking in the sunshine, because that's still productive. My body needs it. It's good for my hormones, all of those types of things. So every day isn't the same. But every day is planned and leveraged according to what I know about how my body operates. My brain operates. according to the things that I want to accomplish at that
00:09:00 - Michael Fujinaka
makes sense. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Like on July, what was it that night that I got 17 minutes of deep sleep? I guess it was July to 3rd when I woke up. Yeah, I got it was awful that day. I was like in a haze in a days and you know, there's a couple of times in the night, Emmy woke up twice screaming in the night. So I got up at I think one and then I got up again at 4.30. And yeah, it just destroyed me on Wednesday. And then Wednesday night, tried to get to sleep. But you know, I could see that I got it. I started my sleep routine at 9.30. I remember you said your sleep routine takes about an hour. Yeah, it does take me about an hour to wind down. I take a shower, put on my lotion or whatever, brush my teeth, write my journal. And by the time I actually lay down, it's about, yeah, it is about 10.30.
00:09:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's about 90 minutes, actually. 60 to 90 minutes. 60 if I'm exhausted. 90 at the least, otherwise, sometimes it's two hours, but if we're talking about the whole sleep hygiene thing, the like washing base, brushing teeth, I pray and kind of meditate, saying good night to the girls, closing up the house, like to me that's a whole part of the winding down. And then I'm so, but that's not part of the 90 minutes. Once I get in bed, that's the 60 to 90 minutes. So like the brushing the teeth, all that stuff, I'm talking about just being in bed. That's usually the 60 to 90 minutes, 90 on a bad day, 60 on a good day. And there I'm listening to something or reading or I have a mindless kind of game that I play because it's like I still have energy in my body, so I'm not ready to just and but because it's mindless, I don't have to, I'm not using my my brain to solve things. Um, yeah, anyway, so So that whole thing and I discovered that just going through lots of different things. can't read books if I read a book I want to know what's next. I have to finish it. I have to complete it. I can't put things down. I can I don't like to It's not relaxing to me. So I can't do that, but I can listen to scriptures because I've read them so many times. already know how they end anyway, but it's also It's the narrator. There's all these different things that I've learned About how my brain responds interacts engages or doesn't can't listen to music cuz wants to follow the pattern All of these things and I'm paying attention to everything that comes into it. So anyway, just learning that type of stuff And and that's why I really want you to notice like in the journal the next day. So what was your routine life? What? that you do before you went to bed. But what you'll find is that it's really difficult to, you can't create the same thing every single day, especially as a parent. And so knowing what the levers are and mostly just getting up in the day, recognizing how you feel, taking into account the things that you have to do that day. But I also like to take stock of what has to happen throughout the week. What we can talk about time blocking as soon as we start to get into this business stuff, which I'd like to talk about today. But it's kind of evaluating the, I'll call them big rocks. I don't know if you've ever heard of Stephen Covey. Stephen Covey, a Franklin Covey who does the organizers and the day planners and things like that.
00:12:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I think I have, yeah. Evan habits of highly affected people.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, I know that. Yeah. So he has done this great presentation, and you might have seen it because lots of people. We'll have done it, but it's you have a jar and next to the jar are sand and rocks, pebbles and bigger rocks and water. And he says, can you fit all of this into the jar? And people try to do it and it doesn't work, it won't all fit. But then he starts with a fresh jar and he puts in the big rocks first and then he puts in the smaller rocks and then he puts in the sand and then he puts in the water and everything fits in the jar. And so he said the only way that you can get everything in is by starting with the big rocks first. So that's where terminology and a lot of business stuff has come up with big rocks and it's what matters most is what you start with because even at the end of the day, let's say some of the stuff doesn't get into the jar, you got what matters most. So you kind of decide through a series of priorities, principles, values, and whatnot. of evaluating what it is that you're doing. So what are the big rocks for each business? What are the big rocks for you as a person? What are the big rocks for you as a father? And we do have some homework to come back to you with the family values.
00:14:15 - Michael Fujinaka
Hopefully you did that. I did not.
00:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, where's my notebook? Boogie. Didn't get his homework done. What kind of consequences should we have for not doing homework that you're paying for to get these results?
00:14:33 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know. What you suggest?
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's painful? And what can I hold you to? That's the thing. I have to be able to hold you to it.
00:14:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I know. have no idea. I have been doing the cool showers in the morning. That's very painful.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but that's not thing like if you're already choosing to do it It's the accountability part you need work with and so the the Consequence has to be something Inforceable ish like that the one client. He's like the only way I'm gonna do it is if you charge me money He's like a Jewish. I hate paying money Okay, so But he was the only one that was really bad at accountability. I don't really have to do it for other people But this is your thing so we've got to come up with an accountability structure for not doing that and Especially because that is a foundational element of the work that we're gonna do I need to know what the containers are Or your time and for your values throughout the week so that we can create the system But if you haven't defined it and you haven't taken the time to do that then we don't have the foundational pieces are worth it makes a lot of sense but I did tell you that last week and you still didn't do it you're right you're right all right yeah let's let's do something about that yeah that's painful to you that's what it's funny losing money is painful let's do it how painful you got you have to decide I have to decide no idea it has to be painful to you but well I know my massage is cost $90 actually yeah $90 so I think if I lose $90 I could get another nice massage that's good because now it's not you know it's not excessive but it's you can relate that to something else yeah but we're gonna do that for everything that you don't do every time you don't do it I'm gonna send you an invoice at the end of it and expect you to pay it and just, but don't do that anymore. I mean, I'll take your money if you want me to, but I'd rather you do the work because then you get the results.
00:17:12 - Michael Fujinaka
I would too, got it, I agree.
00:17:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so you owe me family homework. I'm gonna go ahead and send you an email after this as a reminder. So family goals, time. What does the day look like? And the week in terms of like, what should your weekend look like? How available are you? That type of thing. I'll go ahead and write it out a little more clearly. And I imagine Esther's gonna get you out of this by probably answering most of it for you, but that's okay, that's delegation as long as the job gets done and you agree with it. It has to be that you agree with it with then you're not, there's going to be resistance, right? So we're not going to lie to ourselves and say, yeah, this is it. And we're not going to play games and we're not going to say anything that's not true. Got it. Okay. So that and food, time, energy, mood, journal, every Sunday by 9 p.m. because I don't want you up at 8 p.m. Let's say that. I don't want you up later because of it to cram it and get it done. So it's not in my inbox by 8 p.m. on Sunday, you're late. So because I don't, I don't want you staying up late to do it to avoid consequences. Everything about what we do together is going to be engineered. to improve and help you stay within the things that you've you said are important to you.
00:19:06 - Michael Fujinaka
So I did read the book or I'm listening to the book switch and that concept is in that book where it says you have to shape the path and make it easy for the elephant to go down the path. So yeah, if I didn't even pay attention to that part, I didn't realize that was in the book. Yeah, interesting, like this is a path, right? It's like you're making me do it at 8 p.m. so that I'm not tempted to stay up late to finish my homework, which I know I'll do. And so that will force me to start the homework earlier to get it done by hate.
00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I want you to pay attention to too, in terms of like people that you work with and whatever, this is our third conversation. I already knew I had to do that with you.
00:19:55 - Michael Fujinaka
Because I'm paying attention to you.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it. So that's important. If you're going to work with that is helping you with anything. They got to be paying attention to you. Last week you were saying it was new somebody listening to you and and working on like what matters to you and what's So I want you to continue to see the evidence of what that is rather than you just telling you, hey, Fuji, we're going to talk about you and it's going to be about you, but really it's not about you.
00:20:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So I didn't see my notes on this and I thought you were going to forget about the family goals. So yeah, no, it's good.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not here to forget. I'm not paid to forget. I'm here to get results and I'm competitive. So I plan on doing a good job for you. That's what I do. I love it. Okay, so actually, where's my notes?
00:21:00 - Michael Fujinaka
Can I think of how the rock and the sand and the pebble thing fits what it said in switch was that you know that someone had like a bunch of loans that to pay off and it was interesting switch was advocating that you start with the small goals that you could beat out quickly. But I guess in that is just one example that maybe like to fit it in the same scheme as you know if you have a big rock that you need to fit in you still need to figure out how to like you know like you can't just tackle the big rock I mean you can but go after the big rock in a way that gives you small victories so that that kind of makes sense to me is that you know getting early small victories will get the buy-in to keep going.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and this is why I talk about levers and leverage because what works for you one day may not work for you another day because of your energy so going back. to the finite willpower also and the fact that you've got to battle your brain for some things. So let's say you've got a big rock but you can't get yourself to do it. So one of the things I do and I'm working on creating a course for it because I want to teach this to more people but I only have I take very few one-on-one clients but it's a time evaluator and of all the things that I've had people do and we will do this it has been the most kind of eye-opening pivotal exercise that we have and it's a simple spreadsheet and we track everything that you do for a couple weeks. Really it works ideally if we do it for a few weeks because there's so much variety in the tasks generally for especially for CEOs entrepreneurs because we're all over the place. So what we do is track everything that's being done throughout your day, period, personal, whatever, obviously within reason, we don't need our personal personal personal stuff. But then you, you categorize things according to profitability, to skill level, like is it something you're really good at? Something you really bad out, bad out, where's the spectrum? Energizing versus draining, necessary versus, so how much time do we spend doing things that are neither profitable nor necessary? We find those things that go, do you, out of your 24 hours in a day, effectively maybe 13, 14 hours a day, is that really where you want to spend it? And, right, but also, as you start to look at it, what has been, Just really kind of eye-opening for people is how little time they spend on the most profitable activities Um, and then the other thing is finding out what are the things that are necessary? Are semi-profitable, but they're foundational Meaning that they have to happen in order for the profitable activities to happen and that could be bookkeeping things like that So in those things that are draining um not First position profitable, but secondary profitable or necessary in some way um There's two things that we'll do so when possible we delegate And so hire an expert always an expert because if it's not an autonomous expert In that seat taking care of that thing for you you still have to put mental energy on it Managing them. Did you do it right? Whatever so we don't be cheap when it comes to delegation We get leaders as much as as possible, balancing out how much it costs, obviously, but trying to, I'm always managing energy most with zero energy. I could have all the money in the world. If I don't have any energy, what am I going to do with it? I can't enjoy it. I can't leverage it. I can't figure out how to manage it because I'm too tired. So we always manage energy first, which is why I love that sleep was your primary goal and focus that you wanted it to work on. So anyway, but if there are things that are profitable and necessary and you currently don't have anybody that you could delegate it to, but it's either you're not great at it or it's draining. So the stuff that has to get done that sucks. We'll just call it that way, right? So energy silences. I call them energy silences when you sandwich something that you, that is energizing and good and it doesn't have to be business it doesn't have to be a rock it could be breakfast it could be a walk it could be cuddles it could be anything that puts energy into you then you do the thing that sucks and you've already planned what you're doing afterwards and you've planned a cut-off time so the cut-off time could be either a very specific time or a easily predictable ending point meaning like in an hour roughly i should be done with this particular part of it right so let's say you are like me and you need to close the loop you're not going to cut off when there's a few more minutes left of it you're going to you just want to complete it so if you can tell that there is a you know an ending point choose that and then when you're done you're done and you immediately go to the good energy thing but mentally you already know you're looking forward to that you already know there's something good that's coming right after this you and it resets your energy, resets your mood and that actually so of the energy sandwiches you you want these especially when this thing sucks but is really necessary you really want these to be potent whatever they are and almost always I want the ending part of the sandwich to be a physical activity because the stress that goes into your body when you're doing that difficult thing you want to release that you want to literally work it out of you so walk, gym, exercise, something but you want to be moving as much as possible so I'll show you what that looks like and we will do that but not right now let's see okay let me go oh I did that's what I was pulling up all right you ready to start talking about the business stuff
00:28:01 - Michael Fujinaka
I'm already, uh, I'm already behind on the sleep and everything. just, uh, pack it on and just nervous about what we're going to do. Let's do it.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. We're digging in. Yeah. Um, okay. So I'm looking at, I'm ranking things based on the hours that you said that you work eight to 11 days per month, Q and E. Yeah. And how many hours in those eight to 11 days per month? Uh, a week. I mean, a day roughly.
00:28:41 - Michael Fujinaka
pretty much in general, we try to craft those days to fill up clients. So I usually depart at about 730, like I'm leaving the house at 730. I drive maybe an hour. Try taking Uber now because I'm And then I, yeah, it's pretty much all day that I'm working. May I show you a calendar?
00:29:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anything you want to share, the more information I have, the better.
00:29:17 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay. So, let's see if I can pull this up here. Screen number one. So this is how, let me July, July and August are messed up because of the baby, but essentially if you could see right here where it says the 22nd of July. It's my next big day of work.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:53 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. That's the one where we're meeting at five. Yeah. So I start. So my office this time is in daily city. So I have 10. and offices around northern California that I drive to this one's in daily city about 30 minutes. So I'll probably leave in the uber. I have to get there 30 minutes before my start time so I have to get there at 7.45 so on this day I'm going to leave it 7.15 from my uber. And then you see I have appointments every 45 minutes 8.15, 9.9.45, 10.30, 11.15. I think I said go a few lunch here so 12, 12.30, 1.15 and then I finished it too roughly for that day. And then the next the following day I started 9 in San Leandro which is also about this one's about 45 minutes away. I at 9. have to get 30.30 so I leave at about 7.45 and uber and I have appointments every 45 minutes until 5 o'clock taking uber home takes an hour to get home from San Leandro at night time so I'll get home about 6 that day. You get the idea, sort of. Yeah, then on Wednesday, it's the same thing, but my office is in San Jose, which is about 30 minutes away. this one finishes at 2 PM, and then 25th, I don't have any work. The next week I work on Wednesday and Thursday, the following week in August, I work on the 6th and the 7th, following week after that on the 13th, following week after that, I work three days. So that's kind of my schedule. It's all over the place, but eight to 11 days a month, generally.
00:31:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how do you feel on those days?
00:31:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I love it. really good at it. I'm really good at this kind of work, and so I do enjoy going. It's like my time to do something I'm really good at. And I know what to do, right? It's easy now. It's easy. I'm good at it. I think that's why I like it, right? I know I could do it and it makes me a lot of money. Every appointment that you see is essentially $2,000 with profit for me. So it's easy to get myself out of bed to do, you know, five, six, sometimes 10 visits a day.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is, I was, I was nervous about that, but I love that you love it. You know that there's not a lot of people that really love what they do. I love it. I love things. You said it.
00:32:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I like it a lot because I'm just good at it and it's easy now. know what's coming. It's fun to kind of like figure out how to make it work for these medical cases. And yeah, it pays me a lot of money. It's like it hits all the boxes. So I don't know if like I love it. I would. Choose to do this, but it's if I have to work. It's definitely work. I love or I like a lot You wouldn't choose that. No, I mean, I'd rather sit on the beach thing go surfing like I did on Wednesday You know, they're like boogie boarding on the beach. That's what I do. I'd spearfish for food, you know But but if I had to do something that made money or like I had to do some that work This is like the biggest bang for my calorie like It's just I got it.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay Good. It's all and it's not When you see like well, you generally won't see my face probably I try to do it from time to time to connect, you know and But but when you hear it and you hear me cuz because you'll be able to recognize what I'm like wait, what? I want to understand if there's a Conflicting kind of state payments or values like, all right, because if you say you love it, but you wouldn't choose to do it, then, but you, you in the realm of I've got to work, I've got to earn money. If I have to, then this really, and the fact that you said, so being really good at it, it being highly profitable. And then also, when you said you like to figure out how to make it work for people, so puzzles, you know, they kind of light up an intelligent mind and that it's kind of some gamification for you to be able to participate and engage in. And to me, that speaks to the longevity of it, being able to, as long as there is, because I don't know, especially because you enjoy the, I don't know, spearfishing is like relaxing, but that's also
00:35:00 - Michael Fujinaka
a game to like. Oh, I just do that out there. don't know. I would go surfing every day or jujitsu every day.
00:35:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
jujitsu too is a wrestle though. So that that um and jujitsu is like you're engaging every muscle in your body. So that's my love.
00:35:20 - Michael Fujinaka
That is my love. If I had to say something I would do every day at 12 which my colleagues do sometimes that is what I would do every day. jujitsu for an hour.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you do it?
00:35:35 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, once a week on Sunday afternoon. So they have a free it's called open mat. It's for people like me that don't pay membership. It's called open mat. So anyone that is busy can't go can go from 10 to 12 a.m. on Sundays. I missed it this week because everyone had COVID yesterday. But yeah, usually I could do that and then I've been trying to make an effort to go Fridays from noon to one. another open mat for people that are busy, but they have a class every day at 12 to 1 and I've been I've been thinking about like figuring out if I could make that work from my schedule to go like you know Monday through Thursday or something or even just Monday Wednesday Friday. But yeah, that'd be great. But all right, you know, you know, schedule is just so so varied when I have to do the Q and E days that it's just sometimes just I haven't wanted to get a membership because yeah, I don't know.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there only one dojo in your area?
00:36:36 - Michael Fujinaka
No, there's there's a couple.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is where principles and priorities values come into play and where sometimes we make decisions based on values that aren't actually the ones that we really have in that service best. but they're the ones that are most apparent. So not spending money you're not using. Whereas the other way to look at it would be investing in access, maximum level access. So if I was making a million dollars or whatever, like let's just say I'm making so much money that I never have to worry about it, everything's paid and my wealth is growing. Okay. True. And I'm not in a situation where I have zero time in order to do that. I have wiggle in everything. I do.
00:37:41 - Michael Fujinaka
Right?
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And I know that joy is an energy maximizer and I know that physical fitness is a life, money, joy, and longevity maximizer. Agree. Okay. I'm going to give myself and use my resources to have as much access to pause. I'm going to be a member of every JoJo.
00:38:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I see. Yeah, I was wait. Yeah, I just can't. It's hard to like wrap my head around spending 180. The membership of this gym, I love the gym because I know all the people, but it's like, it's $180 a month. And it's, they don't have any packages. It's just like you either use it or you lose it. So like every time I can't go because they have evening classes too from six to eight, but I've said like, that's family time for me. So I'm like, oh, but if I can only go eight possible Monday through Fridays a month.
00:38:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you pay $120 to go play for an hour at the place that you love the most?
00:38:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know if I'd be $120 an hour.
00:38:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the place that you love the most to play on the best playground. Or do the thing that you love 100 you pay $90 per massage.
00:39:04 - Michael Fujinaka
I love massage. Yeah, I love you just do That could be $90. I got a package.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:39:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I love to just do I also don't like paying it because in the classes, I don't like how they're run How do you do fighting for 12 like I just this like they spent half their time doing like cardio Which is like jumping jacks and I'm like, okay for 30 minutes I can do at home the last 15 minutes is they teach a move and then the last 15 minutes is what I love is the rolling Like, you know getting actually like wrestle with you. Yeah, so it's only like 15 minutes of that whole hour of these spend So that's another reason like I can't wrap my head around spending 100 whatever $180 for that 15 minutes of that kind of play.
00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would I pay for it for two hours? Yeah, an hour, yeah Well, so but here's the thing if you're going twice a week Yeah, that's 30 minutes. True times 4.5 in the month, right? So that's two and a half hours. You just said, if I got two hours, I'd pay $180.
00:40:07 - Michael Fujinaka
Well, okay, that's interesting.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's less than a dollar a minute, by the way.
00:40:16 - Michael Fujinaka
You're right. My wife says it's, I told her this too, and she's like, just sign up. What are you waiting for? I'm like, oh, gosh, this is so frustrating. don't wrestle the entire class.
00:40:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to rush. But what if, what if you became an investor and instead of paying for a class, you say, I'll give you $1,000 a month, but I would like you to create this one class. And it's just rolling. It's just my favorite thing. And I'll come to it and they put your little card out there.
00:40:44 - Michael Fujinaka
Interesting.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, this is the thing when you have resources and you look for levers everywhere. if one doesn't exist, you make one. That's one of the great gifts about money. Like, you, you're like, I want to make sure I can give my family and do all of these things. But it's also power and you can do good things with it. So now they're getting extra money from you. But what are the odds that you're the only one that wants that?
00:41:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that's true.
00:41:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're just managing the way that they choose to. Maybe the way that they think is right. But maybe they don't know on a business level. They're missing out because other people feel the way you do.
00:41:24 - Michael Fujinaka
I love that. That's actually really creative. One of the coaches there is willing to stay a little longer because I'm drilled with them. There's two things I like is drilling, which is practicing the moves. my whole Jiu Jitsu game, I'm really good at probably maybe 10 things. Out of all the different thousands of moves, I'm good at 10 of them. And I drill them more than anyone else. I practice practice practice. And that's what I like. So my idea would be I'd do 30 minutes of that. maybe I work on an 11th move, for instance, and I just do that for 30 minutes, and in the last 30 minutes, we fight, or we wrestle. So yeah, that's a really good idea. Maybe I could propose that to the schools, like, hey, I will fund an extra 30 minutes at the end of class, that way I get 15 minutes in the class that is the wrestling, and then 30 minutes of my, you know, the drilling. And then I'll pay for that coach to stay there. You know, that's actually really creating there. I know they get paid 25 an hour.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not, it's actually cheaper than the members. Yes, yes, but also think about this long term. You're very young. You know you're gonna continue to make more money. You're going to need to have investments to protect your money, or the government's just gonna take a huge chunk of it. What if you bought your own dojo, and you hired your own sentes, and you get to make the rules? there's so many different ways. maybe it's not the now thing, but if you loved Jujitsu that much, you could create programs. youth programs, other training programs, and again it doesn't have to be an altruistic thing, it could be just an investment in your network. The more people that you know and that know you and see you as just a community leader, whatever, the more business you get, and I don't know if what you do makes that relative or not, but there's all kinds of angles to always consider, but at the end of the how I'm going to get what I want. I'm going to use every resource available to get what I want, because when I'm happiest, the people that I take care of are best served. I think everybody's like that. All of us have gifts to give, and even if we take any kind of altruism out of it, we're just happier and better and more productive when we get the things that we want. Jujut. too is like tell me something that there's that's bad about it. There's nothing bad about it. There might be some risk of injury involved, but there's risk in life. You could choke on a fly breathing in like anything could happen, you know what I mean? So, but if that's, man, all right, we're gonna spend the rest of the time going over this, but actually this is useful though because I did get to your schedule and so this is important.
00:44:28 - Michael Fujinaka
was realize the times of my life when I there was a time of my life for about two years where I would go to that the 12 one o'clock class probably probably three times a week and I know that when I do jujitsu like on Sundays usually or some of the Fridays I mean I I'm just everything's better right my mood's better and I'm not as snappy I I yeah because you got that cortisol out yeah yeah I'm willing to. Yeah, I'm willing to work and You probably sleep better. Oh, yeah, I definitely sleep better. think so. I know I know more you did too Yeah, and it is crazy that I don't use the resources to to get access I've never thought about thinking of it like that But yeah, if I pay or use my resources for access Yeah, I just I hate I hate the value of it Even if I'm paying for it, want there to be good value in it But yeah, there might be creative ways I could work with that.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is you just flipped the value You were looking at what you weren't getting instead of what you were getting and you weren't looking at How you multiply what you get so you just said that when you do it you're in better mood You're more energized you sleep better. All of those are already values that you stated. Those are currencies so If you're looking at the only currency exchange as I give money I get 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, right? Then that's an upside-down equation. Well, we all have to learn how to evaluate more powerfully. That's where the leverage is. So, but if the currency exchange is, you're giving $180 and 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, plus hours of happiness, plus an entire night's better sleep, plus all the activity that comes as a result of the better sleep, a better mood, AKA, happier Esther, happier Emmy, happier new baby.
00:46:43 - Michael Fujinaka
That currency is, your ROI is pretty solid there, Fuji. Okay, for 180 bucks, yeah.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:51 - Michael Fujinaka
I actually went through the trouble of asking the coach if I could buy a package, you know, like a package deal where I put, you know, $100 and I get a package. you know five lessons or something and they were like now we don't we don't have that it's 180 dollars or nothing so I I did try little things to weasel but yeah I think if I shifted what I'm getting the ROI like as an investment oh this is great thanks Tia this is great welcome I'm here I'm here to help um and I this is why I end up keeping people for years and I like to do it because I'm going to look for ways to be helpful to you and if I feel like I'm slowing down and not being so helpful I'm gonna go be like okay what does Fujini now go work on it I feel really I feel really good like hopeful right now I think yeah I am gonna make an effort to to get back into this because it is something I whenever I talk to people it's something that I love is jujitsu and wrestling and yeah girls too to put them in there oh yeah yeah that's yeah Emmy I've I've been taking every Monday Wednesday ice. I actually shifted, if you notice my schedule, I actually shifted my Monday and Wednesdays. The reason I finished at two is because I can come home, takes an hour to get home. At three o'clock I pick up Emmy and then I get her to Jiu Jitsu by 3.30, class starts at four. So I'm making an effort to essentially coach Monday and Wednesday toddler class Jiu Jitsu for.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, I love that.
00:48:27 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I don't get to do it, right? I'm just there moving the little three-year-olds around. But yeah, as long as I'm able to do that with my schedule, actually, we revamped my whole schedule to make it so that Monday and Wednesdays I'm pretty much free every week from three to four.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and this comes back to the family values and container, because you just said as long as I'm able to. With your situation and the leveraged activities that you have, there's no reason you shouldn't ever be able to if you. prioritize that. You have the ability to keep everything in proper containers so that you're maximizing your revenue without spilling into the family value container. And that's why we need to set them. So when you give me that, that time with Emmy and Jiu Jitsu needs to be there. I need you to think about everything that is important in your schedule that you have probably just done not unconsciously but without making a conscious correlation to a value. Like this is what I do, not this is what I do because this is critical and important to me and I want to make sure to protect this. Because I think that there are things that you do that with but you just haven't consciously said. and stated this is the value and the reason why I'm doing this and and that okay so it's 11 days let's see and that was QME July medical so what is the thing that you do with Mark?
00:50:21 - Michael Fujinaka
That's July medical it was what I started with mark was a different business that I had a really poor business relationship and I exited that in 2022 so July medical is something I started in 2023 and it's the same business that I used to do except now it's 100% telehealth. Okay I see so when Mark's clients get into car collisions usually their doctors you know about this but you know their insurance their own doctors won't see them because car collisions are like another litigation. There's legal, so their doctors don't see them so my clinic or clinics like mine will step into seed patients on a contingency or lean and that means I don't get paid for a year two to three years but I see them for free on a contingency and now my clinic july is 100% virtual and so that's what I work with mark on.
00:51:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay um do you only do that with mark like is he your only person that you do that with?
00:51:31 - Michael Fujinaka
No I probably have about six to ten law firms that utilize my clinic and each of those law firms will send me roughly I don't know 10 to 20 clients a month and my expected return on each of those clients is about three to four hundred dollars each client but I but I have to wait right the payout is right right never or two to three years in advance so yeah mark was saying his average settlement is like 18 months yep
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but you don't get any other clients other than what attorneys send you in that business, is that correct? I don't allow it.
00:52:10 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't let people come to my clinic unless they're represented by an attorney because they just, they're going to fail. Like if you fight against the insurance company without an attorney, most people fail and I get zero.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And that's one full day per week.
00:52:33 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I mean, I think I have to spend about eight hours, maybe doing it. And that's the stuff that we talked about earlier in this called the bookkeeping, you know, making, watching over my staff checking notes. Every single note that comes through. So we're doing about like 15 visits a day. I look through every one of those notes every day to make sure my nurses that work for me are writing good notes. So I think all in all, it probably is about eight hours a week, roughly.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not all in one day, just kind of spread out, or how does that work?
00:53:09 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, every night, I take about 30 minutes to go through all the nurses' notes. you use just about 10 to 15 notes. And so I read through them all, make sure they're accurate, and then I approve them to be sent to the lawyers. So that takes about maybe 30 minutes. then the other, maybe I'll take like a block because I really don't like to do it. So every Friday or Saturday, I'll do it. I take about an hour, two hours to look through my books. I look through, I make sure that the staff is getting paid, kind of more like the administrative stuff. I will answer any hateful, even I hateful, but like emails that people are, like patients are unhappy about what something we wrote. So I kind of leave all that to the end of the week, and then I do it in a block of time. It's about two hours, an hour, two hours.
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you ever resist that task or does it bother you or you just do it?
00:54:10 - Michael Fujinaka
The 30 minutes every evening, I do it because it's, I mean, I know how much I'm going to make. Each visits 300 bucks and 10 visits, that's about $3,000 to $5,000, So I don't mind doing that at all. thing I resist is probably going through the problems, the problem emails that I have. And I have a manager that actually screens it. So that's been helping a lot the last couple of months. It's just things that need my attention, just very weird things that come up. one of them needed, couldn't do an MRI because they had a gunshot to their shoulder. So I needed to change the note to make it a CT, a CAT scan or an x-ray instead of a magnetic, you know, MRI. it's like little things like that that come up that my manager can't fix.
00:54:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I have to take care of every week. So, um, one thing to potentially consider is maybe that's an activity that you can move in or schedule to be something that you do right before Jiu Jitsu or something physical where you can go release that stress very quickly, or somehow consider the energy sandwich and but create a physical release for after that. So, obviously, not late at night, also that's probably not conducive to your sleep.
00:55:33 - Michael Fujinaka
That's a good point.
00:55:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I usually do it in the evening. Yeah. um, I don't allow stressful conversations whenever possible. Sometimes things have to be had past like dinner time. We'll discuss it tomorrow. Oh, interesting. will discuss it tomorrow because because number one, the open moves in my brain. So, likelihood that we're going to solve that tonight. Yeah. With the amount of time left in the day with the fact that everybody's winding down, whatever, probably not very good, but it is going to live in my brain. And I'm going to try to solve it where I can't actually be working on it because it requires somebody else to participate in a conversation in a process whatever, right, because they're the one that brought the problem. So, but if I say we will discuss it tomorrow, I didn't ask any questions, I didn't engage in it, so I'm able to compartmentalize most things. Some things are, all right, we're dealing with this now. This needs to be resolved right now. You'll know what those types of things are.
00:56:35 - Michael Fujinaka
They're not very common, but some of those things come up.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Especially as daughters, you're going to get those. But whenever possible, I would just say that problem will wait until tomorrow when I'm in that kind of zone. So, in the morning, I don't want to engage with anybody. don't do client work. I don't answer emails. I don't respond to anything that could be, um, conflicting or contentious and they're not the same conflicting could just be I don't even know I have to make a decision and I have to evaluate things so it's complex I'll say complex nothing complex in the morning because now I'm in problem solving mode. But in the morning I want to be in creative mode. So, because I want to use my best mathematical skills for creation and building and leveraging rather than problem solving because solving a problem honestly I could do that stuff in my sleep. But being creative is not a space that I'm in all the time. My brain is good enough I can solve most problems most of the time. Creating is different. building my business, creating new solutions, creating new organizations, hiring things like that so so my morning time is for. reading, meditating, just being slow and quiet sometimes just hair and makeup is a therapy thing for me. I'm just quiet. I'm not listening to anything. I'm just pondering and thinking while I'm doing it. And this has been really helpful for Mark too. He's doing meditative stuff now, but he used to talk Dolce. But in the morning, what he used to do is reach for his mom and immediately stress cortisol problem solving. His creativity, his problem solving in a creative way has massively changed since his morning routine has changed. Speaking of which, have to go meet with him in one minute. So we'll go through more of this schedule. But the goal is every week that you've got something that you feel like you can work on. something that you're pondering, something you're enacting, so we've got the gist of it. will send you a follow-up email within the next few hours. I'll say by end of day today, just because Mondays are kind of crazy and I gotta make sure where's my phone, set my alarm, set an alarm for 3 p.m. Call it get-go-g notes. And now you're official. Yeah, so good job. You'll be getting an invoice too for being 8 if you do it again. We'll give you, I don't want to give you a free pass. I'm gonna give you a free pass, but don't do this again. Get your homework done because, you know, massage or like, just imagine you won't pay $180 for just when you like it. You're definitely gonna hate that whole $90 for not getting your homework done. So I'm gonna give you one pass, one. All right. good talking to um you know if you guys do end up having the baby if everything i would love to hear about it we'll do be healthy be well and we'll talk to you soon

I'm doing great.
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you doing? I'm good. Time like flies. feels like forever. And also yesterday that I talked to you. Like, it's always the weirdest thing to me that time just is like that.
00:00:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The summer going fast for the kids.
00:00:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Madeline a lake day tomorrow.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. We always go to the beach.
00:00:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Pontune. Pontune? Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.
00:01:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's right. And Mount Hood too, right?
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

How long ago was that?
00:01:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, God.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was in college.
00:01:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like 99 or something.
00:01:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.

I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We have it. It's a. a lot lazza roll or something like that it's It just mellows around we would do it around if there's gonna be fireworks Cuz she gets real nervous with that, but Yeah, we gave her a pill If you find out what the details are and let me know cuz I have a dog that cries every time he gets in the car drives me Bonkers bonkers.
01:13:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I will let you go. It's so good to catch up with you You just maybe not be such a stranger for a month maybe yeah, no promises You know I wrote on that sheet a couple times couple I saw once I Know once this month and it was last week All right, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. too.

Oh, nice.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm very excited about it. But I have this people that build my deck did not build it right. And so it's very creaky. It's not always been creaky. And that's where I work. And it's driving me bonkers. So now I have to deal with people coming in and out and probably doggies and the doggies like to play tag with the deer around here. They will chase each other up and down the fence. Because if we had some baby deer that were born and they used to sleep under my porch and they've grown up around my dogs.
00:00:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And they will so cool.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chase my dogs and my dogs will chase them. But my dogs will be barking their heads up while it's happening. So it's cute. But also my brain.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love it though.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like deer.
00:00:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you kidding me? I remember when I lived in Florida, the golf course community we had deer in our backyard some mornings and beautiful to watch.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they're actually living there. That's That's so cool. I will show you, I'm going to text you a picture of these so you can just kind of see the area.
00:01:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
These are my kiddos and my daughter.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going grab my Turn it on. Well, that is my two youngest daughters and my, the one in the back, that's her boyfriend helping them build it. And there's also a tree house that I had built for them up there, which is huge. It's got astroturf and lights inside and papisane chairs and we can see the whole city and It doesn't take a while to get to me because I just turn you on So but so where do you live exactly? Southern Oregon Okay, and so you call it if I'm a falls. It's a dinky little Redneck town is what it is a hillbilly place, and I can't wait to leave but I had babies here, so Years and and so do you have like a big backyard so that though? It's not very big actually so we were resting for a long time after I got divorced I basically found the safest place I could as fast as I could and then they sold it and I didn't get much notice So I had two months to find Finance and close our house Which is that almost snow time. And the criteria primarily was be in our church ward and in our same school district.
00:03:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that limited it tremendously.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it was a beautiful house and it was brand new. So nobody's lived in it. And it's on a hill, which is crazy in the winter because we get a lot of snow. But my kids went from playing outside and playing basketball all the time to day stops playing outside immediately. only moved the block away. But because of the steepness of the hill, these lazy kiddos would not walk up it. So they stopped playing. There's no neighbors that talk and visit. And it's beautiful, but it's just I need them to be where they're engaging with people more and okay, pros and cons to everything.
00:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. So this one they're building.
00:03:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are they building in this picture? That's a gazebo.
00:03:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's going to be it's
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to be, see if I can find a picture to show you what it's going to be, because I also have a really nice couch that goes outside, but the pine tree just keeps dripping sap on it. Well, it would if I didn't keep it covered all the time, but because I keep it covered all the time, nobody wants to deal with the cover and take it off. so this has netting on it. We also have a smoker grill out there, but this is what they're building.
00:04:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's going to be gorgeous idea.
00:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I already have the lights and everything.
00:04:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fairy lights. Yes.
00:04:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I bought this big like wicker egg chair that is. seen those.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So making our, I'm a, I'm a homemaker. That's my money goes to home and family and traveling.
00:04:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's it. I love it. Yeah. We redid our whole backyard last year to want to make it look like an English magical garden. So we have that we we might still. We'll do the gazebo. We said no at first when the designer suggested it. But just because it's mostly evening when I want to be out there.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Come here. Come here. Come here.
00:05:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that dear.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't say hi.
00:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, cute.
00:05:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my that's my Baha'nies boy. Okay.
00:05:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
English, English garden.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I saw picture with your mom or a video. She was smelling her roses and it looked so peaceful and nice back there.
00:05:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It is. Yeah. We're in a really small town here too in Canada. yeah, it's nice. And my mom's backyard. Actually, I worked from her house yesterday afternoon and she was just cute thing because like she goes to take a nap in the afternoon and then and it was really bad rain. Like we've had flooding here and everything. But it. So you're not at about three o'clock yesterday, all of a sudden five o'clock, she comes down and her bathing suit like, what are you doing? It's five o'clock and she goes, I'm going for a swim. I'm tired of being inside the house all day. know, I'm like, Mom, you have more energy than me.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're amazing. It's the naps, Maria.
00:06:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
powerful. It must be because I was just amazed. was just like, here she comes. she's 88 years old and she just, yeah, come down down and get her bathing suit and just goes and swims, jumps in the pool. I'm like, Oh my God. And then she's like, how come you don't have bathing suit here? So I know, you know what? I'm going to go buy second one and just keep it there. Cause I probably would have joined her, right?
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I told my friend to do. Cause I have a friend and she comes in Queens for me on Friday because she's amazing and an organizer and so smart. Anyway, I talked her into it and pay her good, but I'm like, I'm swimming with me. yeah, yeah, like that water sunshine. I don't need a lot else.
00:06:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. know, that's right.
00:06:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I've been excited about this. I tried to be productive. I'm telling you, the beginning of my existence is not having people to work with. It didn't used to be a problem for me, but the older I get, the more it gets like that. I think part of it also is after getting into this transitionary phase, I really feel my emotions coming on, I'm annoyed by it. But since my older girls have moved out and I haven't had the chaos at home. And the energy of all these people, because I left the workplace, that was difficult. Then the kids got bigger, know, I had four of them. And so that filled me up. But now they're gone most of time. The two are the two oldest are gone all the time and the two youngest are gone most of the time. And so I wasn't aware of how much I was feeding off of their energy, even when they weren't in the room.
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Got it.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's annoying. I'm not really a cry baby, but like my emotions are I worked so hard to not suppress them anymore.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I purposely let them be free, but it's really annoying when it's this one.
00:08:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll cry when I'm mad. I'll cry when I'm happy.
00:08:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll cry when away.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like, I've got to figure out. I don't have enough work to hire somebody regularly. And I'm like, if I just get one more client, I'll just pay somebody just to sit there with me.
00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I need riffing.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need somebody to sit there and hammer things out. And I've never needed that before, because I had energy around me. I didn't know that I was literally drawing energy from their presence, even just being in the house. But I'm very conscious of but now because I noticed when I'm productive, it's when they're here and they're busy doing stuff, even if we're not together, I'm like, I can do stuff. They'll be gone all week long. And I'm like, I'm gonna get so much stuff done, get nothing done. The second they get home, like, boop, boop, boop, boop.
00:09:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, interesting. Yeah, so that's where I've been, like I'm not really not getting a lot done, but I did work with chat GBT last night.
00:09:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get these little spurts where something pops to my brain and I will capture it. But that's basically as productive as it gets. I won't sit down and do things. But because you asked me, let me go to my notes here. to be crying, whatever. me look somewhere from my face, stop the leap. What are you, what's that? There's a child. Anyway, so talking about a welcome video, you said to think about video training and structure. so what I was thinking, Let me close this, is that, sorry, I'm not on my normal computer, I'm on my laptop, so I have to kind of like organize everything better for this to crank drive minutes. So, think about video training and structure, and so, I was thinking about this, and I think that no matter what entry point, somebody comes in with me, there are, there are going to be some key principles that I want them to understand before we go forward, because I want them to complete whatever they came here for, because it's always their time otherwise. And so, the thing that I know, wow, that was, sorry, okay, the thing that I know is that, in order for us to do things, we have to be committed to it, so we have to buy into it. Otherwise, it's just a momentary fluke, you know, they're in the moment, like how many times Time is your brain committed to something and your 10 minutes later is like, I'm not the same person.
00:11:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're not doing that. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but if I get buy-in, I kind of get buy-in to the spirit, not just the energy of that moment. So, I think in the beginning, I want to tell them when they get there, okay, so and so you sign up for this, whether it's paid or free, whatever it is that we're doing. And the reason that you did it is because there's a result that you want. And there's a result that you want because there's something missing that you don't have or there's something present that you don't want or both. Okay. So, here's how we're going to get it, but let me explain to you why working with me and going through what I'm teaching you is a little bit different. I'm going to explain to you leverage. And I'm going to explain it very quickly, explain what a lever is, and explain how it's doing working you. that's almost impossible making it very simple by applying pressure to a device, a device being a system, a structure, a process, whatever. But I'm actually going to have like a little picture or maybe a jiff that shows a very simple lever, a stick, a rock, a heavy thing, and they're like, you can't move the rock and then you push pressure on the lever, boom, the rock goes up. That's leverage. Most people are not ever thinking about leverage. And if they are thinking about it, it's not constantly, it's not persistently, it's not intentionally. Because everything that I do is leveraged, always looking to increase my leverage. I'm always, people talk about working smarter, not harder, but how do you do it? It's levers. It is what devices can you use that gets more from less. So I want to teach that to them very quickly. Like we just cover that maybe two minutes, but they should be engaged in it. Most of their brain. are going to be like, you were listening, they're probably going to be listening, like, I can get more from less. And you're telling me how people always tell me I should, but they don't tell me how.
00:13:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or why it's simple or why it can happen. So they just learn something new. first few seconds that they're there with me.
00:13:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The next thing is I'm going to tell them I need you to consider energy. This is a resource that we all have. But as you know, it fluctuates. It's sometimes unreliable. It's sometimes not there when you need it to be. But most people think about energy retroactively. I want them to think of it proactively. I am always thinking about energy. I am thinking about tomorrow's energy today. And I'm doing everything I can to maximize today's energy and tomorrow's energy and making my choices consciously so that I have sufficient, if not, plenty of energy to be able to do all the things that are most important to me. And then the next thing I'll tell them about priorities because how do I have energy for the things that are most important to me if I have it consciously and intentionally chosen what is most important to me. So, so-and-so name, we're going to go through an exercise, a series of exercises that are very quick, that are very succinct like the things that I just explained to you that are going to help you sort and filter the current activities that you have so that you can learn how to prioritize them and so that you can learn how to leverage your time to get the most out of it in the least amount of effort as well as maximize your energy. And this might seem like a big ask and that it's a lot to do but what I can tell you is and I promise you that if you will spend whatever time it takes to get to this. Some people can get through it in 10 minutes. Some people take, you know, two hours. But if you take the time to go through and organize these, to complete this task because I don't want to overwhelm them with describing it yet, then I guarantee you, you're going to have a shift in the way that you spend your time and the way that you spend your energy and you will think about it differently forever from this point on. But when you think about it differently, it's going to be so clear in your mind about how you can do differently. when you, here's the thing, if you want to be different, you have to do something different. But if you want that different to be good and strategic, then the difference that you do has to be good and strategic. And I'm going to tell you, without knowing your business, without being over your shoulder, I'm going to show you how you can custom tailor, not according to what I I think is important, but what is important to you, your activities so that you get more from less of your time and so that you have more energy and more peace while you're doing your activities, your work activities, business, whatever. I'll improve that script a little bit, but basically that's it and then send them through the exercise and then have a closing one. Like, okay, this is not, so first of all, I want you to pause for a minute and I want you to ponder and reflect on what did you experience? What was your aha moment? I would like you to write down your ahas. What were your epiphanies? did you notice that maybe you didn't notice before? What did you notice about how you should not be spending your time or how you should be spending your time? What did you notice about energy and what could be altered and improved? Now what we're gonna do is go through and apply this. I want you to do, sort your activities according to, you know, what we just did, and then I want you to spend the next 30 days operating with this new awareness. But what I want you to do again in 30 days, and maybe you're not an overachiever and maybe you want to do it in 90 days, but you want to come back to this activity soon, and what you want to do is the same activity. You want to take stock again of where your time is going, how it's impacting your energy, how it's impacting your profits, because now they've had it all explained to them that it's energy profits, time, all this stuff that they're looking at. And ask yourself, because now you're a new person, you're a new person tomorrow, you're a new person 30 days from now, you're a new person 90 days from now, and I want you to go back through this activity and go, is there something else I'm not paying attention to that I'm not aware of? And what I can promise you is that you will have changed, you will have a new epiphany So if you continue to do this, this is called an iteration, we make a new change, we make a new improvement, and if you continually do that, and maybe it's not every 30 days, maybe sometimes it's every three months, and maybe one day it's six months later, and maybe life got crazy and it's a year later. But thing about this is that I'm going to teach you timeless principles. You can go back and apply anything I'll ever teach you, and every time you apply it, you will have an improvement, because you will have changed in your awareness and understanding will have increased, and so your ability to apply the timeless principle will improve the results. So it doesn't matter, if you're really consistent about doing it, if you're more consistent, you get better results, but every time you do it, you will get good results.
00:18:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so, so Breaking that out. I I started taking notes here. So so video ones about leverage video to energy and priorities to shift To shift you away like how you spend time how you think about your time And you're gonna kind of have them do exercises in that video too during video too By the way, like it everything you just said first of all Overall summary, but I went into like okay.
00:19:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's create this mode. Okay mechanical mode.
00:19:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
get it. I'm good Yeah, yeah. so so yeah, like just real quick Rather than just drawing. I just want to start this little document. So Energy and and here you'll you'll do also talk about yourself and success stories, right? Okay our results So energy and priorities shift away, okay, so and then come back in three days since activity repeat Take stock where time is going how it's impacting your problems. It's all this in video too and the exercises.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I didn't break these up. What we could do is I could just make whatever comes out and then we cut it if cutting is needed. But what I was imagining is the leverage energy and priorities is all in the welcome video because all of that is a preface to what we're about to do.
00:20:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's very short. I cover it in less than five minutes.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it could be broken into chapters or it could be broken into short of videos. But I really do think it needs to be a contained thing because this is the before you start you need to have this. It's a micro lesson.
00:20:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Five minutes is still very short.
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it is a timeless lesson in and of itself. Leverage, energy priorities, and learning how to maximize those and also the concept of persistence and consistency. which are not the same thing. Persistence is how energetically you're at it, right? drive for it. Consistence is frequency. they're both separate elements, but if they're both present, those are productivity amplifiers and magnifiers and multipliers. So that's what makes it leveraged also when there's persistence behind it.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Persistence is a leverage.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consistency is a lever. So, but these are not, this is not how people are thinking. Most people don't think this way, which is why when I get the new clients I've been getting are attorneys and doctors and they're paying me a thousand dollars an hour and their minds are blown. And so like I, in my point, is not anything. It's just that these are some of them are Ivy League and They're still not thinking like this. My point is that this is not, people aren't trained this way, but once they have the understanding, these are not difficult concepts and these people are not too stupid to understand this. It is, it's just not taught and given. And so anyway, anybody could apply it to any type of business, any type of activity, any type of stewardship and they will be better, they could be a soccer coach and this would help them. This would help them. You know what I mean? Like any stewardship that you have, leaders said, this is how I think I'm going to be arrogant, but I'm probably arrogant.
00:22:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I'm sure it would help a lot. I guess the thing I'm thinking in my mind is just, yeah, let's get the training done and out there and start having people go through it to get the more testimonials and stuff for it.
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just sitting down and getting it done, but I need to just sit down and get it done. Today. It'd be a good day. I just I need to do day. You like just give me do they say Tina? need you to have X done by X and be aggressive about it because I could do it. I need I need accountability. need help. Please.
00:23:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So so two questions. Yeah, we can give you deadline is and the first question is is in one week good enough like by Tuesday next week.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah.
00:23:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because it should take a total of like four hours or less. Like it could be one hour. But I know myself sometimes it condense 60 minutes of concepts into a five minute video more valuable than just blabbing away for 60 minutes.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't mean think it'll be an hour.
00:23:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I already have a video for this. Actually, I just want to make it for it's way better now. So it's all years ago and it was like 20 minutes. So let's have a deadline of a week from Tuesday. Yep. Oh, Friday. Okay.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Friday. Awesome.
00:23:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I could have it done by tomorrow.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But I won't push myself.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I have What's today Tuesday? Yeah, yeah, and the second question is for you to get this done will be better, would it be better for us to just do a working session where I go. Okay, go create video one right now and let's come back in half an hour. Okay, let's do that. So, so, yeah, go create video one right now and then let's reconvene right now.
00:24:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Well, normally that would be good today because of the work situation.
00:24:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Gotcha.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. But but we could say, you know, create first draft today. Let's have a working session tomorrow. Like we can even wrap it up if you want to because I don't want to monopolize your time. I paid for a certain amount and I don't want to use that. Yeah.
00:24:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What? Go ahead. Tomorrow's wide open after 12 noon my time.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I didn't get around, yeah, my brain, Maria, oh, so I'm taking my daughter to girls camp tomorrow. That's early in the morning. And, um, the heck is that? Oh, so I found a co-working thing yesterday, actually. Oh, cool. And, um, it's called flow dock club, I think.
00:25:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to try doing something like that.
00:25:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
totally forgot about it already.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, um, flow dot club, I'll go to the website. Yeah, go look at that.
00:25:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. We're going to get your work done. Go get focused free. Oh, that's cool.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It seems like different people create their own sessions and their types of sessions. that they want. So this one that I chose, it's called 120 minutes, finished strong flow club with Lex, and she's like a law student or something. And so they have five minutes of briefly sharing goals with the group, 50 minutes of doing solo focus work on mute, five minutes celebrating at the end. And I was like, that's perfect.
00:26:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's amazing. This is amazing.
00:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I really need that.
00:26:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:26:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow.
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. Yeah, I like it.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but then I meant if it was today, that'd be even better. I don't know how they're, how long they're gonna be working on this because even though, but I imagine it's gonna be a while and that's just a major brain disruptor.
00:26:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, I get it. I get it.
00:26:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like if I have my cleaner here and sometimes just ask me questions. Oh, I know. Yeah. Oh, you're going to hair appointment is white going with you. Are they still working? I'll pay you all. I love you. Bye. Have fun. I love her hair done. Okay, so hasn't told me what time she wants to be for girls camp tomorrow and it's 45 minutes away. So I really Don't know what my availability is until I know at least she'll be there by 10.
00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I at least we'll be back by 11 My time so noon my time is to wake up. Wait, what time did you say you're available? Yeah, like after 12 noon Um, nine a.m. So If you're available after 12 noon, your time that's three o'clock, my time that works. I go up till about five o'clock. And then Thursday, Thursday after 2.30 PM, after 11.30 AM your time.
00:28:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I have a call with Dan from 12 to 1 on Thursdays, but then I'm done after that. So if you have that time block tomorrow at noon, and I hate to ask for a tentative time, but I'm okay if you can't do it. But if we're just reviewing what there is and then, because honestly, if I finished it, I'll just send it to you and say, here's what we thought. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be a fixed time. We can just do kind of a back and forth for the most part. And then if... I can experiment with that flow session and see if that's helpful, but basically what I need for me. Okay, so your offer super , by the way, was, you know, it takes you 18 or whatever, 180 hours. I don't remember to come up. was a structure and a format of things that need to get and things that you would extract and then this is what we've got out. So the bullet point of even that mental focus of, okay, these are the things that we need to have. So you go, you know, Tina, you go create this and then you're telling me if you tell me what you're doing, that will help me just go, okay, these are my containers.
00:29:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go fill them up.
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there, I don't even like, if I could look at the sales page, I'd go back and look at that. Epic, could you help me figure out what the structure is and what, what all I want to need to do and like, how do we get to the finished product? So I know if I create it, the, I create the training, um, then there's, there's copy and there's all these other things. What parts do you do? What parts are we doing together?
00:30:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:30:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
been a thing.
00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So basically, um, I'll, and you're kind of a rare breach that you're going to So like, I kind of do the copy and, but you know, you, like, you might have something that's like stellar to write instead or add to it, et cetera. Um, less is more in these little $3 things. keep in mind it's really just a headline bullet points stuff. And then, um, I will like, uh, help put together basically, like once you have the training done, like I can kind of just take a look at it and. Just, it's more just review what you've done, like, like, again, you're kind of every that you're very experienced all this. So it's more like, is there a worksheet or success action that needs to be better or added to it to make sure there's consumption, right? my biggest thing about this is like, how many people are really going to use it? So there's that. And as far as getting it done, yeah, like I'll do the sales page and even the technical set up of it and the reality is, again, then what's the order bump going to be? So I help strategize like what the offer portfolio is. So what the order bump should be and then what is the what's after they buy the $3 thing, whether or not they buy the order bump or not, they land on either a thanks page or like upsell one page. So typically what's not in scope, obviously, is crafting up to the one upsell too for you. But typically what a lot of people do, and I even suggest that even for the, like, product boss who've made a million dollars with their $37 offer, right, is they first started with just the front end thing, and then it wasn't up. So one was just a thank you page for the first month. And then after that, they added. So what you could do on the thinking page, like we just need to figure out what what you want to send them into. So it could be, you know, book a call and into, you know, your private coaching, it could be, you know, just for now, love how creating hybrid coaching, like, I don't know what it looks like, and how much of your time I can buy, and how much of your help I could have that being able to stay focused and basically getting through the offer creation.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I can implement this co-working so I've got, you know, something to help me do my stuff where I don't need your high level brain. But I tend to overthink offers, and copy. I do know less is more, but I also know that long copy does a really good job when somebody needs more time to be convinced so I go through a gamut of logic and I just go like that. But I also know that done is better than perfect and perfect isn't real. But because I get stuck in my head having somebody just go, well, this works. Let's try this. You know, this is what I do with my people.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, let's just try it. Like, you don't know. Yeah, that's kind of what that is. Just try it. That's kind of what this is because like, what I, to be honest, what I kind of foresee for you for just a cadence, I really feel this is that it'd be cool because you're also your energy so amazing live and zoom and stuff. It'd be cool if like, end result, six months from now, what's the cadence look like? That, And also from the customer journey point of view is that they come in and two ways to get access to you from cold, right? Is either buying the $3 thing and remember you're still building your list because the way the $3 thing is they opt in, right? For it before they buy so they're gonna have lot of abandoned carts Which is still on your list and that person might buy something else for me And and then you have once a month like a mid ticket like a hundred dollar maybe live workshop once a month. That's it So you're starting to build an offer portfolio from that because if the workshop is slightly different every month not the same one Those things can become you're up. So one you're up cell to see how we're kind of the case But also I'm riding on something else here. That's interesting We're in a weird and year into this also because your your love of psychology and everything and trends Um 2024 and 2025 26 we're in a weird movement moving forward because with AI and everything. Yeah, content online is a commodity like anybody like you know a 16 year old kid could pretend to be a 45 year old and say I made a million dollars and put up a bunch of content and you know whatever do okay so I think we're shifting to A that's why I like the $3 thing people want some immediate thing for cheap right to get to know you yeah low-risk yeah and they get a taste of your stuff but be also some live access to you because authenticity sells right so so in that live access you know is engineered like I'll get to the group coaching session for second but but if it's once a month like this workshop you don't have to do this for the rest of your life you actually building up all these other little products that can be sold and then also the workshops can be recorded and chair won't go up sorry and so that becomes part of the concert That library anyway, my brain will exactly exactly. And then if you're going to this, this is actually, I'm actually re visualizing my own micro offer kind of business to is is and I like this concept is that then you go to the hybrid coaching that's way more high ticket, like maybe it's a hundred bucks a week or 250 a week with you and you're only doing in your game for this to, you know, live coaching a month. But they get access to you. We can figure out what the pricing is and stuff, but because I know you're really good at that, like, because that really resonated with me last week about the value, right? so discounting. But you know, you could have some more high end kind of group container coaching that is not like open, close, open, close.
00:36:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more like it's there.
00:36:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't like that game and also can't talk about consistency.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do that. So it's out of alignment. with my other principles to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. so the monthly workshops can also be built based on kind of the feedback you're getting from people. Like you could have a beta, beta founders join my, you know, XYZ program, you know, Go ahead.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just going to say what I like about it being so low ticket filling it up is that what what is really difficult for me is low energy. So, so like when I show up to alive and I've done group training and there's hardly anybody there and everyone's quiet, it drives me nuts. I can talk to myself. I want to. I don't enjoy just hearing the sound of my voice that you wouldn't know because I don't shut up. But this energy, it's because of you. Like, because you're here and not just because a person is here, but a person with an amazing mind and personality and values, I'm feeding off of that. So if there's nobody in there or there's a couple of people or their weak energy, like I really want to be able to fill up a room.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:38:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, back to I draw energy from kids that are here, and I'm not even with them. Like I'm very sensitive to energy. But also, as you've experienced, I can project it, which is why I'm never afraid of AI because no type of AI has spiritual soulful energy. And I do know that my translates through text even.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why, but I know that when people read my words, even just the words change them. Pure text, no images. So, you know, like I'm excited for that, but I also have to keep it in the energy container of, I can't build a framework that requires too much of my time. I need to leverage my time so that yeah, whatever access people get to me. Um, what I wanted to be is an environment where the energy is there for them to top into because even if they are aware that they're feeling the energy and being benefited by the energy, they're still being benefited by it. They don't have to. They just need to feel it and that they're getting so, so one of the things that I've learned is that where most people just kind of throw a grenade at a business or they just make you want to overhaul everything, I'm taking surgical cuts, that's what the leverage is. So anyway, but I really want to be able to find a way to work with you long term. I don't think I need a lot of your time and maybe because we were talking about the CEO of the Spicy Brain CEO being separate, but and I would love to serve you if there would be a way that you would like to use my brain, I would be happy to just share it. Find like I'm not opposed to paying obviously. Yeah. Yeah, not what I mean, but whatever it is Maria I really I want to spend more time doing this together. I would love to support you So to separate I have a habit of converging things and this needs to have its container But anyway, I get excited when you talk about it and those offers that makes logical sense to me And I'm excited because this is what I need Cool. Yeah, so so no, it's cool So yeah, and I definitely think that too because I think you could help me a lot on focusing and in your time management stuff and just You know, yeah, so so now so really what we're talking about is sort of like you're just selling Different levels of access to yourself right like is the three-dollar thing You know is like there's just your training right in the worksheets, you know, but I do have more training So just just because my work on Yeah semantics of it and logistics of it like there is definitely more training to be had that doesn't need to have access. Yeah, because I think that I can train it in video very well. And I think that my energy and my experience have been that even in video and it doesn't have to be live, the energy is still contagious. Yeah, infectious, you know, and so I do think that they're on the spectrum are more levels of it's not access to me per se, but just to the training and that there's always an upsell of access with whatever level of training they're getting. yeah. But there's definitely more modular type stuff that we can sell and package and put together. And if I do these co-working sessions, I can hammer them out because I can do the stuff in my sleep. Yeah, have the energy, just the energy. Yeah, anyway, so that help kind of Yes, we're selling access to me. Yes, there's a spectrum of it and the price point, but we also can sell just the information and the training. That's a lot of words to insert that. Sorry.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, I got it. That's good. good. um, yeah. So I think, I think, yeah, first up, let's just get the training part done, the $3 thing done. um, you said, your clients just get out there.
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'll get it out there. Okay.
00:42:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And just, so, and just close things off. um, when are we, it's kind of potentially tomorrow, right? And you're just going to text me.
00:42:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what, how about we do this because I, I don't, um, can we schedule it for Thursday or even, um, Friday? And do just email communication back and forth, because I think if I create something, we don't need to be on a call for you to say, you know, you need to go create this, like, I just need you to be able to review it. And then to me calls are for brainstorming, clarity, you know, things that can't be done through email or vox or even I love the audio messages, because I don't like I love talking to you. I love that. If I if I can just get the stuff done, I'd rather have your time for riffing, you know, that type of thing that can't be accomplished the other way.
00:43:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree.
00:43:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. Okay. how about we don't even schedule anything yet. I'll get my work done. And then the only way to get access to your time is to get my work done.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. And Friday's your deadline. Okay. All right.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Love it.
00:43:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thanks. All right.

So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?

00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, we can shift gears, Tona. We can go back to that because I'd rather use Mark's brain for two things. So what you brought up is just...
00:07:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

Yeah. My little girl went to school for the first time in a week. They've got COVID. It's been going around yesterday. I almost want to cry just thinking about it, but I got her up, and I'm like, are you going to go to school? She goes like... I need to like yeah, you do and so I go out and she gets dressed and she's to the door and she's got her backpack on She's being a good girl, I look at her and she got tears down her eyes, and I'm like going back to bed You were not going to school Okay, I feel better now. Okay, wait, no actually she thinks that's distracting me I was trying to pay attention to what you wanted. Okay, so When you're talking about she has a first shot at first one shot at first impression. Yes What is good ice? Oh, look how cute.
00:08:30 - Chona Sweet

00:08:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're beautiful Cool sandwich place in New York City Tell it's based in Tuscany, I guess like all on Tonshio sandwiches So they make the bread fresh every five minutes and so it's really thin You guys get all this good food.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I live in redneckville, okay, and they're And when I get to go visit my sweetheart, I'm like this Let's have like just feed me. I'm I'm happy. Okay. So, okay, so the automation and follow up. Sorry, is a conversation we were having. But the fact that you brought up first impressions, make me wonder if there's an issue that's happening. Okay, so let's talk about that.
00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.

I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.
01:01:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
can call back and do a conference call with me, you and him.
01:01:15 - Chona Sweet
You want me to talk to him for his waiters, other stuff we need to talk and I'll call you.
01:01:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Plus, I mean, to me, you work with plenty of these types of founders and everything. They get excited by Shiny Ball without any help. That's him.
01:01:28 - Chona Sweet
That's you and him.
01:01:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I want you to think of the driving analogy.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
in a parking space for 30 minutes doing nothing to implement your phone is not going to get you to a spot you need to get to either.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No. Decompressing. That's called decompressing mark.
01:16:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I will slap you. You're just called procrastinating too.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't her sandwich. Then I know. Yeah.
01:16:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mental. She has food in the fridge.
01:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She has it. Mental. I don't even think you understand the mental load of a woman. Like it's a whole not a thing. It's not, it's not picking. Like our brains are different. Our brains are different. So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.
01:16:58 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:17:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, you know, but most of you are in better.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, maybe you can like, do you get more and better? Yeah. Yeah.
01:17:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Not a $406,000 bag nice and sweeter.
01:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Money has nothing to with literally got paid to $406,000 bag and we're both like what the F is. Why?
01:17:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I know. I know.
01:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bag of my house costs.
01:17:30 - Chona Sweet
Okay. That's a bad world. It's just crazy. And there are people that.
01:17:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So how many patients do you need to see to get that? No.
01:17:39 - Chona Sweet
How many houses could you build in the Philippines for that? Seven. saying no to this is, you know, something wrote me like I wouldn't even dare. It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.
01:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Draw that thing out for me because I can help you with that conversation and Mark, there's a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
01:18:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was it happy?
01:18:54 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
01:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:18:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm just, I don't even know what to do with that. think I was happy. My dad was happy.
01:19:01 - Chona Sweet
He's kind of drugged up. He was drugged up at the yeah, no forgiving too much drugs that helped him to sleep.
01:19:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that's okay.
01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.

When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.

Hi.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you, Fuji?
00:00:03 - Michael F
Good. Well, I'm so sorry I missed Monday.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. It happened like that stuff happened, Mom. It's a second. Sorry. this is why I didn't want you in here in the first place, you know? Yeah, it could be anything though.
00:00:32 - Michael F
like to bark at the deer all the time.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They tag with the deer, which is hilarious. They'll chase each other up and down the fence. All right, so let's start with reports, just first your kind of verbal report of how things have gone for you this week.
00:01:00 - Michael F
I started working again so like yesterday and today I did full days of work well totally full but so I usually help with the baby until like one or something like that and then Esther takes over the rest of the evening and then I go actually we have an extra room so I go sleep in our office and then I get up whatever 745 whatever it is and then 730 and then go to work so yeah I'm thankful for the uninterrupted sleep so it's nice that Esther but yeah it's tough on Esther like she was super tired yesterday and super tired today just because I'm not helping her so it takes her like an extra you know 15 minutes to feed instead of gain sleep yeah just baby things baby things that's gonna be it so you have some assignments
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to them?
00:02:01 - Michael F
Yeah, they lose it and then make a better, think, better chart for the sleeve, I think.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we also talked about finishing the business spreadsheet that the time tracker, we talked about tracking time, but we're not going to start that yet, right? Because I think we said we start, I think I asked you to decide when you wanted to start because we're not really, things will normal out more once you get in September when you get your housekeeper, I guess, but she's kind of the assistant also.
00:02:46 - Michael F
Yeah, I think that's a little more reasonable.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, going to wait until then. And how does you do on, I see the stuff that you have in the timesheet homework, but not nothing in step two, just the step one. And talk about that in a minute. talk about that in a We talked about you getting some information from the, or maybe this was the week before now, because sometimes things run together, but from the neighbors about the cleaner. Oh, yeah.
00:03:44 - Michael F
Yeah, we interviewed her. Doesn't really like the cooking, because we were thinking we could use her as a cook to meal prep for us, but the neighbor was like, she doesn't. She can cook in a pinch, but wouldn't have her as that final. She's very meticulous, like she's kind of like loves keeping things clean, so that's nice. So hopefully her and Esther will see eye to eye. And then, yeah, overall, I think the neighbor just says she's just very good with the kids. The kids love her. And, you know, she's not a teaching nanny where the kids are going to come out being like, you know, readers or stuff, she's more of just a companion. She's always talking to them in Spanish. She's just talking, talking to them. And she says both of the kids are like super, and they're both introverted. And she's like, yeah, both of my kids are just like, love talking. They talk in Spanish. And she thinks a big part of that was the, Dolores, the housekeeper, because she's just talking to them, not on her phone or anything like that. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about Something happens in employment.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it just helps you simplify the steps to hire her formally as an employee and so we talked a little bit about the structure of how you would hire her like whether or not you would make that a separate LLC with Esther or like an escort for paying wages. Did you give that any more thought for structure?
00:05:26 - Michael F
No.
00:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that anything that you still want to think about?
00:05:30 - Michael F
You've got some time so. Yeah, you know I'll actually that would just the easiest things I just asked my accountant. I'm like hey can we should we can we hire this person okay and then I think that'll take some yeah I'll just shoot a quick email to my accountant that'll take care of that issue. He says yes then we'll hire her under one of the companies. He says it doesn't really matter then I'll just do this pop-ins payroll thing and and set up. I don't think I'm for that. You asked them by any chance that they use nanny cams. No, I didn't. Sorry, I was going to do that now, but didn't.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want a reminder to think about that or not big deal?
00:06:22 - Michael F
I think let me talk that over with Esther. think that's a good thing. Yeah, maybe a reminder to talk that with Esther. She's been, yeah, because she hasn't had my help at night. She's been a little more sleepy and jumpy. So I haven't really talked to her the last few days about anything serious, more just kind of what do you need? What food do you need by your bed? can I help you with? But I think hopefully tonight I'll be able to help out obviously tomorrow. So I think she'll feel better after she gets. I have no idea how she slept last night. She hasn't texted me all day, so she might be just dead today again.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe they all got some naps together.
00:07:10 - Michael F
Yeah, we bought a new bassinet because she was just dying. She wouldn't sleep in our other bassinet, so we're trying to win that like rocks.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh baby swings are lifesavers.
00:07:22 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would literally just pick the baby swing up. My muscles were good. I'd just drag it around the house if I was doing kitchen work working, whatever, because yeah, it'd be when they get bigger bouncers, but yeah.
00:07:37 - Michael F
There we have one.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but swings when they're little, especially the ones that have the mobile and the music at the same time, and they go side to side instead of front and back so that the baby doesn't experience like that falling sensation, and it's just more.
00:07:55 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah, we have that one that goes like this.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh. Yes. Okay, so what day, like is she starting the first week of September?
00:08:11 - Michael F
The contract I think we're going to do is just straight up September, I actually don't even know what day that is, Sunday, okay, so it's probably September 2nd, yeah, so we'll start her on September 2nd.
00:08:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Esther's got a few weeks, do you guys have some like days to figure it out basically where you have slow days where you can just kind of let her catch up on sleep or something?
00:08:36 - Michael F
We're gonna, oh, oh, yeah, you mean like the trial run, oh yeah, no I didn't ask Esther about that, that would be kind of neat, yeah, just like going like a sadder.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, because Dolores works Monday through Friday with the other family, but I was asking about you like on your slow days just being able to give her a relief on a day a week or something where she could just.
00:09:00 - Michael F
catch up. Oh yeah, that's interesting. I have an like on like Monday, I could help her Sunday evening Monday. Yeah. I think about while you're back to work, there's components of it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One is just the actual being able to do it, but two, there is the remember how it felt as soon as you knew you had somebody coming in. There was an instant relief. So if Esther knows that there's a day that she gets to look forward to know if I could just get through this day, Michael's going to be here and I can rest and or food. She just calls me food time. so she just kind of has like, I don't have to get through to September. I just have to get through to this day. And then I can sleep all day long if that's what it takes. just kind of rest and know because I mean, it sometimes, especially when When they're that young, it can feel just so daunting that your body is never going to get a chance to recover because you don't know when you're going to get to sleep at all.
00:10:11 - Michael F
Sleep deprivation is really hard on mental health too. Yeah, I think she's catching up to her now, but yeah, that's a good idea I could offer that. She gets up every two and a half, three hours to pump, which is just killer for her sleeping. And so, yeah, on the nights that I'm around, she just focuses on pumping and then I do the bottle feed, diaper, and then rock the baby back to sleep. So yeah, I mean, I think maybe, yeah, I can ask her if there's anything more that I can do to give her a more prolonged time off, but I know the pumping is really difficult right now because she's, well, she's breastfeeding in the day, and then she says at night, breasts hurt, so she has to pump every three hours. ours to clear it. Yeah, let me ask, let me ask if there's anything I could do to just give her something to look forward to or or something.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just until you get Dolores and in it, you know, it's not necessarily sleep doesn't have to be about nighttime, but just whenever you can get couple extra chunks like yeah, it was interesting. I was reading a study this week about how napping every well, so being a napper, being quantified as being somebody who naps at least three or more times a week, reduces death by heart disease or any kind of help heart failure by like 67% in women and like 84% in men. And that there is no medication, not necessarily being well, a pill, but any other prescription of any type that has such an impact. no pill that you can give anyone with any kind of heart issues that would have as much of an impact. so you can make all the correlation and inferences to what that does. And also, especially with people like you that have circadian issues, napping is really the only type of solution. And we know that it's been around long time because it used to be there was first sleep and second sleep, because there are people who have always been there who couldn't sleep all the way through the night. And so they got a bit little and I did things and went back to sleep. So sometimes trying to solve for nature doesn't really work out well other than doing the thing that we don't want to do in the middle of day, which is not, but it can be a minimum of it can be effective even at 20 minutes. So anything about for both of you, her and her current situation and you just overall Me being able to create nap pods where you work in your offices. Yeah, that's what my fiance does He has in his companies because he cannot sleep I call him a vampire because he's pretty much never slaves and He's got these little like egg-shaped cocoon areas that are nap pods that he can use but also his employees can use too because there are people who just can't sleep and so there's Sounds there's weighted blankets All kinds of things to kind of descend someone to just sleep much faster and come out more rested so that's kind of cool.
00:13:37 - Michael F
Yeah, I I don't think I've ever gotten into a routine of taking a nap I'm just terrible at the willpower to get up But I guess if I had to have enough if I had an appointment that was coming up, I'd have to force myself up Yeah, that's I
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to the world. I'm comatized. So I only nap when the only way that I'm getting through the day with any kind of productivity is I have to nap. I'm physically and cognitively would I would just be a zombie who did nothing and I existed for the rest of the day. And that's unacceptable to me so I'd rather nap and even if I had to take a two hour nap and it screws up my sleep schedule and I'm up till 11 I've got things to do. So everything in life is about trade-offs. That's a trade-off I'll make. But what happens is when I'm really exhausted, it is so hard to wake up.
00:14:34 - Michael F
So there's a few things that I do.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll have something to drink next to me, sugar. Well, like a vitamin water, not a lot. Sugar, caffeine, something like that can do it.
00:14:44 - Michael F
Just having to get up to take care of my child automatically kicks adrenaline in.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's chemical of one sort, even if it's my own chemicals. I can't be late to pick up my daughter. And that goes back to the whole kind of thing about energy sounds. is just purposely manipulating your energy to do what you want to the other thing that I'll do is I will set my alarm and give myself like a 40 minute wake up window when I read anything I could read a book I could read Facebook especially if I read news it just pisses me off so then I get mad but then again the adrenaline kicks in and it's not about engaging with it I don't actually have to care as soon as I read I'm like let's go I got stuff to do but learning what things like if you ever happen to notice is there a thing that wakes you up like I noticed one day that I was really really exhausted and there were two types of things that immediately triggered that my blood got pumping and I was ready to go with no other kind of help other than what I was reading and stimulating it was um something that made me really happy so a message from a friend a sister my sweetheart whatever That's just me and we go, oh, that's awesome, let's go, today's great. Or that is ridiculous, this world is crazy, I get ugh, whatever, and I'm up. It sounds like a stress response, but really I kind of feed off of opposition, so it's not, it's my motivator. But if you figure out what those triggers are for you, or build in a slow wake up, so let's say you take an app and you know that you're really groggy, and there was a podcast you wanted to listen to. If you are able to, now the podcast is going to put you back asleep, you can't do that. Or read it or whatever, but something that starts stimulating your brain so that the wake up process happens, and then just allowing for the time, but when you look at 40, 50, whatever, right, versus losing even two. hours, even if it's for a 20 minute nap and let's say front loading and back loading the slow down the wake up takes you two hours. But if you get to 80 capacity for the rest of the day, that's up to me.
00:17:14 - Michael F
I like that. Yeah, I think there's natural things like right now, I'm actually sitting outside of my daughter's preschool because I'm going to get her at 315. So like on days and I think I told you in jujitsu, right, we actually three months ago, we carved out my schedule so that on Monday and Wednesdays I finished at two and then I drive to her school. I get here by three and then actually I could just sit in this lot right here and nap for 15, 20 minutes, you know, and then that could be my nap on these days, Monday, Wednesdays at least. And then for Thursday, Friday, yeah, I don't know about that wake up window. could probably think of something but even when I'm tired, there's like nothing in the world. world that is interesting to me.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think if I have like a deadline, like a meeting at one o'clock or, you know, 130, then that's easy.
00:18:07 - Michael F
I just say, okay, well, I could sleep until 110 and then I have a meeting at 150. So yeah, that's interesting. It was three naps a week, three or four.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it was what qualified as a napper was at least three naps consistently.
00:18:24 - Michael F
Okay, so during, yeah, that makes sense during the work week, try to get days when you're just zocked out.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's yeah. And you seem to always have them a couple days where sleep really, really sucked. Right? So if you use them and if you can look kind of for what the pattern is and recognize, oh, this is one of those like minimal capacity days, but maximum, like I got a lot to do. You're like, okay, throw an app in here and do a little journaling and figure out, you know, how does that equation... eight and work out how much more productive are you what does it do to the rest of your nap and what I would do is on days where you take a nap also do something make sure that there's some sunshine because it helps with melatonin production at night and then any kind of movement you can get that day so if it's and it might be harder you might be able to you might have to switch days and figure out what that rhythm is because like for me if I exercise it takes me hours to wind down and be able to go to sleep depending on when it happens and you might not be able to work out or even do jujitsu when you're really sleepy are you ever too tired for jujitsu?
00:19:47 - Michael F
no that's like if there's a day I'm not working at noon I'm just like if I'm exhausted I'll still go I'm always like that like I could work out I mean I used to always work out when I was just exhausted
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because once I did, then I would wake me up or... Right.
00:20:04 - Michael F
But...
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. Anyway, all right. So those are some things to think about.
00:20:09 - Michael F
So... like the idea of napkin. Sometime ago, I did take a sleep class in med school, and I remember there was stuff about napkin, and you know, it is beneficial to you, and I remember even a seven-minute nap was better than 60 milligrams of caffeine in cognitive tests of recall. I don't know what that study was, like, you might find that one interesting, yeah, I was like, a seven-minute nap is equivalent or better to 60 milligrams of caffeine on cognitive recall tests, like how many things you remember, but yeah, but no, yeah, I like that idea. I'm just trying to make that little change and nap something enjoyable, it's not like something that I have to force myself to do. And I think if I could just carve out a little bit of time to nap, I think that would be really cool.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll try to shoot for too 20 minutes to start and then figure out, you know, what are the things that maybe help you get there? So for me, pressure sound because my brain is too stimulated by certain types of things. But it's not human voices and outside activity. So like, if I was in a car, I could totally sleep because people don't bother me but it's sudden loud noises that will disrupt me or it's consistent conversation because my brain wants to tune into it, even if I really don't want it to. So things to keep, maybe in the car or with you all the time, earplugs and or headphones or earbuds, know, something where you can play some and figure out what frequencies work best for you, white noise, brown noise, peak noise, prone to pink and brown, especially brown noise, a mask, which may be too much of a signal in a parking lot, if the parking lot is safe. Yeah, think about those things you do. You don't want to already know you're not being so much, but if you have a cap pulled down low, you still get the pressure on your head, it still blocks the sun out of your eyes. It has the same kind of effect, but it doesn't really send a visual signal to everybody walking by necessarily that you're napping, especially if you're like holding your phone or whatever, like you could just be listening to something. Potentially they have little weighted, instead of weighted blankets, they have weighted, it's like a lap pad. Weighted things can help people get that faster. anyway, if you're really going to be on a mission of sleep hacking and trying to get the most rejuvenation, cognitive and physical performance out of the least, then find the things that get you there faster, that get you to REM sleep or deep sleep faster and as frequently as needed in order to be able to function at the way that you want to through life.
00:22:57 - Michael F
Yeah, I like that.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we have I have the
00:23:00 - Michael F
I have like the headphones. I have three different eye masks that I alternate with. I've never tried a weighted blanket, but I'm interested in that. I'm always hot. I always thought I'd run hot. So that's why I love the car has like cool air conditioning all the time, so I'm always cool in here.
00:23:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you always keep a sheet on you though? Like do you always want to have some sort of, okay, so that's mostly like PTSD and trauma people. So that might not be something, which is why it's really good for people, a lot of people because so many people have been through trauma. So that might not even be anything that's beneficial to you.
00:23:41 - Michael F
It might be more fun.
00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I I'm in my birthday suit, like just splaining out. Free and safe, free and safe. So napping then you have to just get, so maybe taking off your shoes and being barefoot.
00:23:56 - Michael F
I hope you get a nap better.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like if you're in a scrubs nothing constructing so that just all of those things and if you know like today I'm going to take a nap just making sure that that's the case maybe you've got some loose scrubs for nap days I don't know just all of the things and and you'll I think you'll notice over time that you figured out because you're being intentional and strategic about it it won't always work out that you can get it but you'll be able to operate at a higher level more often than not and catch up on sleep more often than not like I have gotten to the point where I don't even have to actually sleep I just have to lay down and close my eyes 20 minutes half an hour and I'm powering through the rest of the day like I actually slept and it's shocking me but I also did discover some really good things um dl phenolanaly it's an amino acid and it's pretty much replaced capping for me it's amazing and uh I did with depression and anxiety, that's gone. And, uh, gospel title sharing helps me with my ADD. Um, during the day helps me stay focused, helps me like, I was really experienced, especially in Perry, menopause, this type of the tongue thing. could not, I've got all the words except for one. And I can't, like, I feel the word, I know what it represents, but I could not say the one word. And so I haven't been dealing with that, but being a phospholipid, it, um, coats the cells so that they can communicate better. And, uh, you know, all of these little things. And then, um, the anything that helps with the neurotransmitters, because I do have those types of issues. They all help with sleep. Uh, things to think about and find out like what your issues are as we go through this. Okay. Um, to the spreadsheet now, you're not really where we can look at it on a good screen. And it's probably been a while. So I'm just going to go ahead and recap what you wrote. Hold on, me go back to my notes real quick.
00:26:10 - Michael F
I'll be easier for you to analyze. This is our second week trying it. Is it easier in the spreadsheet format like this?
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when this becomes really actually the most effective is when you've done time tracking and we have more details on the things and I can see basically the inventory of your hours, where your time is going, how much of your time is going, and then so if you tell me that your most profitable activities face-to-face visits now, you could quantify that because you've got meanings tracked. So we could do some math on that and we could figure out what that is. But then there would be other conversations and we are about to start getting into spending most of our time on this business stuff. It was more important to me to figure out you getting the house cleaner, the assistant, having some of that, you know, this is groundwork. But, but come September, almost all of our calls, I'm going to want you to be in front of your computer, we're going to be going over data. of the time, anytime something comes up, you know, like we just can't do that, then what we will do is redirect the conversation to catching up more in detail long sleeve, probably little bit more philosophical, just different thoughts, those types of things, like we started in the beginning. so, as a natural kind of consequence of just life, and some of those coming up, this is how we kind of circle back, have the technical, analytical, and come back to the kind of philosophical, it's not really that, it's still practical and analytical, but it's just more about how we're thinking about things. So, you, let me go ahead and let's see.
00:27:56 - Michael F
I'm excited for the business data and the numbers because As, yeah, I I think I told you that's what burned to me in my first business, know, between 20, 17, essentially. six years of my fricking life, I wasted because I never looked at numbers. And I'm really so I'm really excited to have someone to, and even now I'm not really looking at my numbers.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really excited to have someone to, you know, force me to look at the numbers with me. We can start. That doesn't have to wait till September. I'm glad that you're excited. So let me look at next week. Because you're just getting back to week, but that doesn't mean that still have my bookkeepers are still sending me monthly, you know, monthly balance sheets.
00:28:45 - Michael F
I have no idea how to read a balance sheet, but I'm pretty good at P&L now. But, you know, those are stuff that I can always look at. And yeah, my bank statements, of course. And yeah.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. know what's helpful for you or what what we can do to optimize things, what you need, but um, I usually don't go deeper than P and L's and depending on how segmented some of the accountant get with that stuff, sometimes my eyes glaze over and I'm like, I want to get that deep, but yeah, I have a detail of P and L that my bookkeepers do and a condensed P and L that I've created with them in a PDF document. So we could show you both and that would be great. Um, and then just kind of going over them in detail. So the things that we're looking for first is, is anything bloated? anything bleeding? if I ask you about something and you're like, I don't really know about any of it, then I want to dig deeper into that. Are you just wasting money? Because everybody, not everybody, but so far, everybody I've worked with has had that happening at some point where it was an expense that got started and is no longer really as valuable or or efficient or something like that. we'll look at that. But then what we're looking for too is, so, because this is driving me nuts, got something in my eye and I just won't. I wanna get it out, but busy. so like looking at most profitable activities, you have Q and E face to face visits. So what do you do that generates those visits?
00:30:27 - Michael F
How do you get more of those? Yeah, that's a good question. It's a lottery system. Well, just take a step back. I have 10 offices in Northern California, and I roughly visit each of those once a month. And I step clients, I try to stack as many clients into those days, so I just have to go once. So to get a person, it's a lottery system based on how close that office is to an injured person that's claiming a work injury. So that's why I go to. like random cities that are highly populous and more blue collared so that because that's where injured people are. So in terms of like how I get more lottery hits, I have like a list of the most popular zip codes in California and I do look at that every about every year and I can kind of move locations within zip codes to find where the injured people are living in zip codes so we've tried to optimize that for the most part in our current we can only have 10 locations that's why I'm not doing like 20 but we try to optimize as best we can and that's how we've come up with our current 10 locations but I think there's more that we could do like if we kept switching them out but yeah part about switching them out is it takes about it's about it takes three months to close one location and then as soon as that's closed it takes about three to three to four months to ramp up on the next, so you're looking at like a cycle of six months to replace every one of my 10 locations. Yeah, so that's why like as long as we're maintaining at least three or four hits of the lottery every month, we're okay with that's that's what we've been doing. There's there has been locations that have gotten me less than two lottery picks a month. Those are the ones like in San Francisco, no one picked me ever in the lottery. So I cut that and I switched it to Merced, California. So that's that's the most recent switch we made.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing, do you have a report of like a spreadsheet or anything tracked where you have how many lottery hits that you get each month for each location?
00:32:48 - Michael F
I do, yes.
00:32:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Esther's manager has that.
00:32:52 - Michael F
Is that something that could be shared with me so that I could Absolutely. Yeah, I would love to see that I haven't looked at it in a box since I changed locations.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, what was that?
00:33:02 - Michael F
About three months ago.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't even know if I have any.
00:33:07 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me collect that. That's easy to collect. I'll just ask for a minute. Okay.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put that on my list.
00:33:25 - Michael F
There's also little like, you know, games that are played because the more doctors that do what I do in a particular zip code, that have an office in that same zip code is me, the less lottery hits I get, right?
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not just a population of how many people live in San Jose.
00:33:41 - Michael F
It's how many doctors just like me are in that zip code and that dilutes my lottery pick. So that's why I went to Merced to try to see if there's more fertile ground where there's less people willing to go out there. But it is two hours away.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's two and a half hours away. So do you get a monthly report of? injuries in the location and that doctors existing in the location?
00:34:04 - Michael F
No, it's a report that I asked California for. California keeps how many lottery, lottery generated in each zip code. And then they keep track of how many doctors are in each code. So I can see how many injured workers there are, lottery hits, and I can see how many doctors per zip code. So I can request that report from the state.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't done that. I can that monthly.
00:34:30 - Michael F
I could.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't. I haven't in like six months since I chose. If when we get to an assistant or somebody figure out if there's anybody that exists that you delegate this to, but deputize somebody to do that every month and to get it to you, you shouldn't be doing it, but you should be looking at it.
00:34:50 - Michael F
So is there already somebody that exists who would have the ability to accomplish that for you and who counted on it? Our manager should, you know, she's I'm a risk master's manager should probably be the one to do this because, um, yeah, that's her. That's wonderful job just to make sure we stay in business and the job, right?
00:35:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so let's, let's make sure that that gets done and you're looking at that every month because then you can, um, do projections more accurately and rather than be proactive, like watch, there's an adjustment, but also sometimes, um, this probably because you have so many locations, you're probably a really good sense of what's actually happening with it. The doctor population is something you wouldn't be aware of unless you're looking at it. And so let's say the doctor population is decreasing steadily and you don't know. And you're wondering, so, so there's a couple of things that I think that could happen that you may not necessarily know that that walk watching it every month could tell you. of all, if doctors are leaving, why are they leaving? Do they know something? You don't know. Has there been some legislation change that's creating issues in the business that hasn't caught up with you yet that maybe you don't want to be in that location, whatever, I don't know, the state versus local government, probably not too much of a big deal for regulations. but also, let's say, because it's a lottery, you're not getting any hints for little long, you're like, I got to pull out and go somewhere else. But simultaneously, doctors are leaving, retiring, moving, whatever. You don't know why they're moving. You just know that they're not there. Maybe instead of pulling out, you want to ride that wave out a little bit longer because the population's going. So, and you know, if you're going to be doing this for a long time, let's say, five, 10, 15, 20 years, whatever, maybe not that long. But the longer that you're going to do it, the more data you have, two things. If you're going to sell it, all the data that you have makes it more sellable, or if you ever wanted to get investors, probably not. But I'm just saying data that's There's so many different reasons why you want to have as much as possible. And as far as KPIs, that performance indicator or, I can't think of the other word that I want, it's not KPIs, whatever, but those those those indicator numbers of what could have an impact on the business, doctor population being one of them, injuries and injuries will have a correlation to industry. So let's say the industry is expanding or shrinking, if it's expanding, more injuries are going to be And that's another thing too, if you if you watch that. So we just want to have more information, track it, track it regularly, bottom line.
00:37:38 - Michael F
I like the idea, it's something that I know I should look at and I know, actually I remember why I haven't put my manager in is because in this industry, not a lot of people know you can get that data. It's called the Public Relations Act, actually you could get it, anyone can get it, you have to make a public relations data act from California and a lot of the my competitors don't know about. this. So they just kind of blindly pick locations. But I've known about this for a while. That's why I haven't given my manager this data. Only me and Esther know about it as much as we trust our manager.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a very small You find an NDA because even though they're really only worth as much as you're willing to go to war with, most people are more afraid of them because they don't know that.
00:38:24 - Michael F
Okay, that's a good idea. Just like be like, hey, this is part of your- yeah, give her the NDA to sign and then be like, okay, I have this confidence. So remember, Swiss, when you learn, help people make the right decisions.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or relation is, here's your NDA. Go do this. Oh, I better not tell anybody. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. I don't think we've ever had our sign in NDA. mean, you should anyway because you're a doctor. I think just anything about your business. You have a specific unique business. They're as you involved. Again, they're only as good as you're willing to fight for and go to war over, but most people don't know that.
00:39:10 - Michael F
Yeah, make it easy to be tempted to share the data freely. Go on webinar and speak about, yeah, Dr.
00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food, your request to this report tells you all the data. Yep. And sometimes you can help people understand too, because sometimes people are just like, well, I'm just telling Billy Bob over here. Billy Bob doesn't know anything. Billy Bob doesn't do anything like that. You don't know who Billy Bob knows and who he talks to. He might have a friend that's in a similar business and they just have to be chatting. Oh, yeah, I heard about this thing that this guy did. And now your competitor knows it. So people are more connected than we think. They have more conversations than we think. So just say like, the safest thing is, you just don't discuss this outside of this office, period, end of story. And you could say it in the Fuji way, not the Tina with the I'll cut you eyeballs. I'm not finding a violin or anything. I'm calm. It's the sweeper in me playing soccer that is like you will not pass that has never died.
00:40:11 - Michael F
So funny.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, so sales calls to law firms for July medical. So what is an interesting one? Yeah, what generates the sales calls? What is the rhythm to that? What are like, tell me everything all around that and then I'll formulate more questions.
00:40:40 - Michael F
Well, when I started this business, um, July, this is completely so this is July medical. This is the one I worked with Mark. Mark's law firm on. I had no clients like who's going to send their client to a telehealth doctor when they can go to an in-person doctor, right? So, um, initially, I, I look back at the business that I. close with my partner and I took the whole list of everyone that had ever sent me a patient from that business and then I just literally tried to get on the phone with them and yeah I would just try to the case managers that work for those law for I found that lawyers don't do anything the lawyers don't maybe mark those but those lawyers don't it's the case managers that give me business they send their clients to me so I just got that list from my old clinic and I just called them and thankfully most of them remembered my clinic remembered my reports and I had to explain to them yeah I do the you know I do this on televisits but I'm like a quarterback and then yeah a couple of them got it so you know I got a couple referrals the first month and I just kept doing that up until about I did it for about the first six months and once I got to about six months into the business which was September of last year I kind of cut back on doing that because I just had I was I was getting good traction anyway and you know I was
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
moments are right though.
00:42:01 - Michael F
If you're not moment to mean you're dying.
00:42:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're moment to be. You're either getting or losing but you're never you never stagnant really. So be purposely intentionally. So one of the things I'd like you to consider is where in your schedule and.
00:42:25 - Michael F
Well I just not on that note. It was actually a conscious decision that Mark and I had talked about. In this in personal injury it's quite litiginous and the insurance companies will come after the doctors actually more so than the lawyers because we don't have patient client privilege and so they could take my deposition, take me to court. So at the point where my business was getting between like three to four hundred visits a month which is where I've been at for like last six months. Eight months now. That was in September, and that's when Mark and I were like, you know, if I get too big, I'm going to stick out, especially because I'm... So we actually sort of like throttled it, because if I kept getting, and what I do now is I kind of cherry pick my referrals, like I actually started turning away some, like for instance, there's a class of injury called slip and balls or dog bites, and those are highly litiginous because it's like, well, how do you know they slipped, right? There's no... It's hard to prove, and so the doctors get questioned a lot. So I actually stopped in like December, I stopped taking that with Mark's help, and now I turn away all that business, even though it could make me like a lot more money, right? But that was the way that I've, instead of like increasing the number, I've tried to pick better cases.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I do you have, anything where you've done the map, a spreadsheet, a calculator of volume over quality and what that looks like to your revenue line over time?
00:44:18 - Michael F
No, it's hard because I don't get paid, I don't get paid for about maybe like 18 months to two years, like I haven't gotten paid for, like some have started paying me, but it usually takes like maybe a year, 18 months to get paid.
00:44:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm aware of that because of mark stuff.
00:44:38 - Michael F
Yeah, it's freaking wild.
00:44:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So don't you, don't you know though in roughly six months what the amount's gonna be supposed to be?
00:44:52 - Michael F
Well, I mean, I can, I have like my spreadsheet and I can tell you right now how much I expect from each case. case, like, my average. So yeah, I could apply that. Really, I'm just looking at how many cases I get in a month, right?
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just multiply that by 300. So there's multiple things. Like, first of all, we look at the case volume, we look at attorney fees, which is, and I don't know, is there a variation of how much you get paid? There's not right? That's like always the same for every case.
00:45:27 - Michael F
I mean, if the lawyer does really well, like the average, like, I haven't done it in a while, but each law firm has a different average, right? sweet laws average is about 500 per case, but my law firms are like 300, right? but I just use 300 in my head because I'm like, well, that's the most conservative thing.
00:45:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I was getting at is that there are certain data points.
00:45:56 - Michael F
How many cases come in?
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many get settled? a month, how many get paid out?
00:46:03 - Michael F
That's right.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now he has Lidify in Salesforce. Do you have, do you just use spreadsheets?
00:46:13 - Michael F
Like where do you track your cases? When I get a check, I have a Google spreadsheet that is, I've mirrored it. So I've created a second Google spreadsheet off the first one that no one else can see except me. And then when I get a check, I just find their name and put how much money I got to get the call.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a better system.
00:46:36 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah. It's hard to track my month. I have no idea how much I got per month, except for my bookkeepers will tell me.
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to have just one of our calls just be devoted to that business and bring Mark in for some of his ideas?
00:46:52 - Michael F
Also, no, this is not a judgey thing. This is just because he and I have worked together.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So also, it'll help me not feel stupid because I When I get into a new business, there's so much I don't know, but I'm in here and I got to be confident and ask these questions, so this is me telling you you're not the only one, like we're all trying to figure out how to do the best thing where we're at. And we all have different skill sets that we bring to the table so, you know, my experience doing the same things over and over again in different businesses. I mean, again, I've got lots of years on you. Lots of years of practice, lots of watching my own thoughts, watching other people's faults and seeing that there are certain things to do. I'm not raising brand new babies anymore. Like, there's so many different things. But even with all of that, there's way more that I don't know that I do know, and it always will be like that. So, you know, but I was just thinking that for two things. Just his mark has been ideas, and it would help me understand your dynamic a little bit better too. to be able to see that in action on a call. I feel like I might feel like a third wheel with a romance that goes on. so we'll talk about that. would you share with me? And if you if you can, because I don't know if you can with so you do not get privileged with your with these people because that's accidents or how does that work?
00:48:36 - Michael F
Yeah, everything that I do pretty much is discoverable under with a subpoena. Yeah, it's very uncomfortable. Like they can even go as far as text message. That's why Mark and I communicate on signal because those delete and I have all my staff message on signal, all our calls are on signal. But yeah, unfortunately, everything is. I mean, like sharing, sharing data with consultants, sharing data with accountants, bookkeepers, that's not a problem.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because what I would like to see is basically anything that you have that you track any of your business. So what would be really helpful is, okay, this is the record, anything that you can do to give me a full understanding of why you do it, why you do it this way, what it tracks, how long you've been tracking it, that type of thing. That honestly, if that was all that we accomplished over the next couple of weeks is transferring that data so I could start kind of wrapping my head around it so that I can formulate the best questions. But here's the thing I want you to always think about when you're planning out your day, when you're planning out your week, when you're planning out your month, when you're planning out your quarter, and I don't even know if you think about it in terms of quarterly goals and things like that, that would have been my guess. Which is okay, we're just really getting track to like you're just very brand new on your own, you know, I never. used to think like that. It's really only been probably the last 10 years that I've been working that way and I could improve a lot and I do the quotes because so for example I have Mark and I think I told you to read Emith. lot of these business type books assume values that I have that I don't have and then I never will have. For example Mark's value is if I want to go in the office for month I'm not going to go into the office for a month. Now almost anybody who's a business consultant is going to say you're insane that's stupid you can't run a business like that. I would not because I would say you're not going to run the best business that way. There's going to be a lot that's going to suffer that way but there's trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in the business it's profitable. Your people are happy and your highest value is the freedom. to do what you want to with your time, I think you created the perfect thing. And business books and business courses don't approach things like that. They will give you that judge you kind of like, well, you could do better. You could hire someone, you could do this. Yeah, it's, but everything comes with more stress, every person that you hire, it's more stressed, it's more responsibility, it's more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to mean expectations is where most stress and anxiety comes from. The more people you involve, and the more, you know, you're like, these are our goals, this is what we're doing, the more you have expectations that you have to meet. So if your higher value is flexibility, and fluidity in life, so that you can be a free agent across the board, then the trade-offs are going to be, you're going to lose some of the structure, and you're going to lose some of the benefit of the structure and momentum, but you're going to maintain that autonomy. and that freedom throughout your life. So you're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and the freedom is the first thing, which is generally who I'm working with, because yeah, I could do all of that, I don't want to. I don't either. I could have been a valedictorian and I'm like, that's way too much effort. I don't want to study. I will, whatever I accumulate during the class, that's it. I still graduated with honors, but I did zero homework. Zero studying. I'm just like, why? I'd rather play soccer. rather do this. I'd rather do that. I'd rather go, yeah. cheerleader and football and track and softball and tennis. Is that everything?
00:52:52 - Michael F
Basketball.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like to play. I still like to play a lot. So. You're you're in the season of parenthood. So we'll take all those things are in the count, but when What time is it?
00:53:08 - Michael F
When do we start?
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, 15 When you're looking at these things I Always want you to start now. You're probably not gonna be looking at this in the week But but I would like you to just glance at this at least once a week for little while while you're starting to consider Time-blocking Which is not necessarily something you're going to do On a physical level like putting into the calendar you can and we can talk about that I Do mental time blocks because that's how loose I keep my calendar There are some things that are physically on there. They're the appointments. They're the meanings Everything else is I am keeping kind of a mental note of the types of things that I want to do and I always know what my priority is I always know I'm always thinking about it. So I always know and also because I've been doing it so long and it's so steady. I don't have to do that. But I still do on occasion come back and look at things like this myself. So you've got in these two businesses. Now QME is the one that makes all the money right now, right?
00:54:17 - Michael F
Yeah. And that's the freedom thing and it's why I July because as long as I'm doing QMEs, I have to do face to face like today, right? There's no getting around that. Like I know that at least 10 days a month, have to 10 days a month or maybe eight, depending on if it's full or not. But like at least eight days a month, I have to be somewhere and that, yeah, I think it's good for the amount of money it makes.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I mean, a long term, I would like to off for a month.
00:54:52 - Michael F
And not have to worry about that. So that's why that's a big reason why I like July and why I'm just kind of foster it.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, for those purposes, the thing that you want to be thinking about with the QME is how do we maximize lottery hits, which is retracting the data and seeing what it is. And we can use some AI to look at the reports, too, instead of having just brain fatigue going over and trying to look at patterns we might be missing. And we can do that. And I'll show you how, even if you already use it, almost every time I show somebody something, I process it differently. And so there's a new thought, oh, I didn't think to do it this way. So we'll do that. And so every week, you at least ponder multiple times throughout the week, is there anything I can do to increase these visits? If you just think of it like, no, not really, but you still want it to be kind of at the back of your mind constantly, so that you're intuitive. except there's a kind of just on that, you know what I mean? You might hear a conversation about something that just was like, maybe I should be looking in this area, whatever. So just the kind of thinking about it just increases your perception or opportunities that might be out, or threats. And for a July medical, we want to figure out what levers there are. So, you want to make sure you don't have opposing goals. Sorry. This smoke is super bad here today.
00:56:34 - Michael F
The air quality is like 281.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fires are so bad.
00:56:38 - Michael F
Where are you again?
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Southern Oregon. Commathals. I don't know if you're part of it. It's a hit though. But yeah, but we get everybody's smoke. It just lands on our basin. What was I thinking? Okay, so you have to watch for opposing goals. If the goal is July medical is your path to freedom, but you're trying to stay under the radar, so you're not growing. Do those conflict?
00:57:11 - Michael F
Yes. Yes.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And if autonomy is the ultimate goal, then are you going to live your life based off of fear of competition? I would say that's a terrible way to live. You have to decide what's the most important thing. Now, I'm not saying don't mitigate those risks in whatever ways that you can. What I'm saying is that we figure out are there other ways to do that. So those are longer conversations.
00:57:52 - Michael F
They're not necessarily longer conversations. They're ongoing conversations.
00:57:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These are the kind of things where answers reveal themselves because we're intentionally looking for them. solutions. But you have to decide and you already have, but you need to make sure also that you're on the same page with whoever you're talking to, including Mark. But if your priority is July medical is your path to being as free as you want with your time, then that has to be the price. Originally, priority didn't even have it was it was singular.
00:58:24 - Michael F
There was no plural form of the word. Yeah, that's true. I can imagine. It was just there was there was one.
00:58:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the one thing. I see now we have multiple and and they're right. But there has to be one greatest above all priority. Okay. And that should be autonomy because that insinuates and implies that you've got the financial resources that like I talk about these three different currencies, time, energy, and money that that that autonomy or freedom means that you've got all of what you want and need sufficiently. at least, right? And you want for nothing. And everything else feeds that goal. So you maximize how they feed that goal. There is, by nature of life, an enemy in opposition to all things. So if you're constantly focusing on the enemy in the opposition, what you're not focusing on is the growth.
00:59:29 - Michael F
Oh, yeah, that's absolutely right in July right now.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what we think about comes about where we put our energy and mind to, that's what increases. If you're focused on the scarcity and the threat, that's which you're increasing and manifesting. And if you're focusing on the growth, if there's sufficient growth, it mitigates competition anyway. If you're networking so well and taking care of of the people that send you business, the attorneys, if they're just falling in love with you like Mark's tweeted, what do you care if there's competition? They're going to cut you out? No. Also, I fully believe you can't take what's mine and you can't take what's Fuji's. It's either for you or it's not. So even if that's wrong, we know that there is evidence from MRIs, from all kinds of things that show what our brains do when we believe things, when we focus on things. It activates us. We behave differently. So you just have to make a choice of am I going to focus on playing small, on purpose, on purpose is what you just told me or being free.
01:00:58 - Michael F
Yeah, that's a it's a good point. I mean, yeah, I've been just staying kind of small since September of last year. Really, I haven't pushed growth at all. I'm just, yeah, it's been nice. It's, I don't know, nice, but it's kind of bruising and we're growing in the right way, I think, but I'm not really pushing it at all.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's kind of weird, huh? It is weird.
01:01:20 - Michael F
Well, and there is definitely something to be said about keeping the guardrails on so that you don't grow too big, that it becomes a problem.
01:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then if you're looking at scaling, then, then a part of that is hiring the right kind of person, hiring somebody who can help it grow so that it doesn't become a burden, like Mark has Mary, but also he's got some really great attorneys and he's investing and coaching in them to make them better leaders. And we've done things like more surveys to find out what their weaknesses are. what are the things that they feel like they need to know. So we've got um grief counseling for the intake people so that they could learn how to have those conversations with people who have lost loved ones because they died. It's some of the the intake people they're like that is really heavy. I don't know how to deal with that because they feel that other person's energy and it was hard on them. And that had never been addressed before until we asked the surveys and in a particular way like his net promoter score surveys were useless to me. I'm like you're not asking anything that is very corporate-esque and it says I'm asking you because I feel like I have to ask you I don't really care. So we changed the questions and then the other thing that we found out is that people feel like they're not good at sales calls which we already knew but the fact that they're aware of it and they want to be better is wonderful. So we went and got black something. I can't remember what it is. Anyway, and they came in and they taught sales. And her best attorney, just from reading their book, like, she already figured out a strategy that was making her money immediately. Sam, yep. so, and it wasn't that everybody was better across the board from all of these things. It was that there were pockets of improvement, but they wouldn't have existed without finding out what they needed. That wouldn't have existed if Mark did invest in coaching for himself and caring about leadership. So his goal still is, I don't really want to go into the office. And so, my job is to figure out how do we make the best out of all of these things as much as they can be without you going in and being a leader and overseer. He's still leading, but he's leading from a recliner because that's what he wants. nothing wrong with that. I mean, he's still like, he's hard working, he's doing lots of things, he's just not in the office with his people. And statistically, that's not what you think of as somebody leading, you know, there. But he's happy with it. It's also not the most profitable thing, but Mark has been growing happier and happier and happier since I've known him. I used to call him Eor. That's funny. Because I'd say how you think he's I'd say, okay, bye, have a great day. He's like, yeah. Okay, yours and Tiggers, you know, he has a Tigger.
01:04:51 - Michael F
That's so funny.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and now he just, he almost never has that energy. And when he does, he automatically is like, yeah. But this is what's good, and this is what's good, and this is what's good, and I'm like that's my boy right there So It's all it's all the process anyway. Oh crap the time. Geez Okay So I want you to start thinking more about how do you get more of your most profitable activity or More out of your most profitable activity. So you're not necessarily trying to spend more time doing it But trying to milk what you can out of it sometimes it's more time and then How we can support that the other work activities? This is where time tracking comes in we want to figure out what we can delegate and so if you look at it and go These are things also. What is not getting done? That should be done. Go ahead and put that down there and we'll highlight that in a different way Things that you know should be happening in your business, but isn't we want that list And then step two, oh, you did, no, I knew you didn't. Okay, yeah, step two. I really want you to fill out step two because what that is is things that energize you, things that drain you. it ranks how good you are at stuff. So that helps with delegation, but it also helps us figure out where's the sharpening of the saw activities that we need to do. And even if we're only putting a little bit of saw sharpening activities monthly, right? The pace is gonna be dictated by you and what you wanna do. But categorizing the things that you do across profitability and then energy and then skill really helps us rank where the time goes so that we can get the most out of it and also how we can utilize other people to get the most out of your existing team and assets and kind of future pace and figure out What would come next in order to get you to more of the profitable either activities or higher leverage profitable activities? Yep, I like that plan Okay All right, so I will send you some notes and In a few minutes because otherwise I might forget and I don't want to do that And then I will talk to you Monday cool.
01:07:25 - Michael F
I have my alarm set this time, and I will not miss it I have two three four alarms back up And always tuned it if you want to because my Mondays are crazy long but that you said that that was consistently the best for you Monday is the most consistent day that I have all four.
01:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:07:44 - Michael F
Yeah, so Good luck.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I only work one Monday a month generally So I didn't Quality to protein and take the day before And just let me know did you did anything pop out to you.
01:08:03 - Michael F
Okay. Okay. was good.
01:08:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:08:08 - Michael F

Can you hear me?

Yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
How are you, Tina?
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm hurting today.
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
You're tired.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm hurting.
00:00:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I'm in pain, but.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a girl thing. Do you daughters?
00:00:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I have one, and I'm married.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, I got the woman thing, having daughters is, I've got four daughters, so it's been fun. It's been fun. But my brain is kind of struggling today with the paint. Okay. And I'm dehydrated. fun times. get my notes open. Let's see. So, let's start with how, so we talked about some things last time, and I always like to start with, have you had any thoughts, just kind of that happened as a result of it, things that you might have been thinking about since the last time we spoke?
00:01:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I think one of the things that you brought up earlier in the meeting was, you know, I think you were talking to Patrick, but I kind of took it on as well as start the day proactively.
00:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:01:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Do important things first, and address fires after, and so I, you know, it, so I've been out since Thursday and came back yesterday, so I've only had really like one day issue. Yeah, to do it. But I've kind of been instructing my team. Every time we meet, I kind of digest what we talk about. And then I try to, like, any, any good ideas. try to pass them on to my team as well as I've been trying to help them prioritize the, uh, the fires, because some clients, you know, every time they call it's a fire, every time they call they're about to fire us. And, um, it's like, well, we spoke yesterday and nothing has changed since yesterday. So, I've been thinking about that. And then, uh, we, uh, we also spoke about being loud in your mistakes and being able to be. confidently wrong. You have to create a safe space for the people around you. think it's implicit, but I don't know that it's explicitly like something that is fostered in the culture, the firm. I think it's implicit in that, you know, Mark doesn't fire people just for no reason, people go just because he doesn't like it or something like that. But I think like sometimes for people like very who come from pretty traumatizing firms, it's hard to trust. So maybe I need to kind of sit down to make that more sense. that it's okay to make mistakes. I want you to take risks. I want you to, you know, give us ideas that I want you to just be there to get along.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. So that brings up another conversation that could be had, which is, and this is a conversation that I've been working on with Mark, which is, and in a matter of fact, sorry, my brain just jumps around and it comes back full circle, but you should have seen a survey that happened around March, I feel like it happened maybe February, which was in the survey, it would have been, what do you feel represents the culture of sweet law? How do you feel about the culture of sweet law? And what do you think? How do you identify it? So would you remember anything about that?
00:04:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, yeah. I think Mark went through it with the attorneys. went through all the instances. And he was pretty happy about it, because it was overall pretty positive. I think there was one remark about how they needed more snacks in the kitchen.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
But it made me wonder, like, how candid people really are, how much they trust that their answers are not being, like, analyzed to see who they're from. Yeah.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And that's why it's something that I want him to do more often. for example, last year we did a survey. And so it's a practice that we're just kind of working on iteratively.
00:05:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
We talked about that last week.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And not super consistently, not on a schedule, because it is still a small. all firm and there's a lot of moving pieces and everybody has a lot of work to do. So kind of prioritizing how we serve and how we work and it's a work in progress and building the framework for creating an optimized business, which means that we have a consistent feedback loop. But to your point, people have to feel safe to give truthful and useful feedback. Snacks in the break room, you know, anybody could ask for that and how much happier, how much, you know, is it going to improve the quality? Not to some degree, we are human beings and we're pretty simple in certain ways.
00:06:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So feed us like, you can be good, I'm going be happy for a while.
00:06:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be thankful and I'm going to remember who fed me. So you know, it's not that that's not useful, but we really wanted to dig for some of the deeper stuff and looking at the values. So, um, uh, Let me go see if I can find it. I'm sweet. Let's see. Share with me. So, it will be 27. Yeah, survey 2024 responses. that the right one? That's another one. There you go. I was working with AI to try to kind of, there's a lot of information to analyze it, not to analyze like who did it come from, but what was the overall feeling. The overall feeling was really great, though, that they feel like there's effective communication, that there's patience, that there's interesting though. is there were some conflicting responses from the same person. So while we don't know who the person is, we do have all of the answers of one person in one survey. So somebody would say something about, you know, we've got great unity and great team and cohesion. And also, but, you know, I feel like, I don't know, a complaint that contradicts what they just said, which kind of, and of course you could be thinking about different scenarios and different things, the wording of the question, and that's why having conversations at a leader level and creating an environment where your pod and your team will talk to you is actually the most useful thing that we can do. Creating a space where people will really tell us what's going on so that we know what they need, because sweet love will be the best place for everybody if we actually know what everybody needs. and everybody wants. And we can't know that if they don't tell us and they won't tell us if they don't feel safe to tell us. So, you know, it's just this whole kind of circle of things to So what could have the best way to create that?
00:09:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Do I approach them one on one or do I have like a group conversation?
00:09:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So generally, the approach is going to be group wise. The support and the so there's also the coach in private praise and public type of thing. So, for example, let's say you have team meeting and somebody says something that is too critical, right? It's not constructive feedback. First of all, you also want to, you don't just want to tell people hey, you're safe and you can say whatever you want to and nobody's going to say anything because that's safe without a purpose. goal is that we also want to make ourselves those people who can accept constructive feedback. So part of the culture and the values need to be, I'm a person who wants to grow and I want to be the best version of myself. So that's actually where you start is asking and trying to figure out like, how do you feel about personal development? How do you feel about, you know, do you have goals to improve yourself professionally, personally, as the communicator, as a team member, as a person, as a parent, as whatever. Because if that value doesn't exist, all of these efforts are moved. They will placate and patronize, but it will be ineffective. This has to be an intrinsic motivation to want to be better. For the most part, I think that sweet law does a good job of attracting those types of people. There are exceptions, and you can tell that those are the people that basically show up for a paycheck. And there's not a lot that you can do with that except for just create strong guardrails basically. So that they know, you know, if you're here for the paycheck, this is what you got to do to get the paycheck. But just so you know, our culture is we're here to be the best that we can be as teams, but also as individuals. And so if you want to enjoy being here, if you want to stay here a long time, then, you know, consider getting on board with these goals and these values. And here's why you might want to do it. Here's here's the reward for it. at the end of the day, there are people who are intrinsically motivated and driven and there are people who are not there only externally driven. Those really aren't very common, honestly. people have intrinsic drive, but they don't necessarily, first of all, even have a consciousness of it. They don't know what their own motivators are. They've never contemplated it. They don't have anybody mentoring them and guiding them. So, it starts with the conversations and just awareness. And from that sparks questions, which return answers, which generally spark additional questions deeper. And it's a series of just probing, gathering information, analyzing the information, adjusting the trajectory and where you're going based on that information. And then probing again, and it's an iterative process ongoing. but those are the types of conversations that will lead to most of it and it starts with kind of assessing who do you have on the team and what drives them. Let me this creating a safe space for VRE. So you have me go back to, let me switch my create one for just you and yep that'll be sweet. So I have a tab manager and I have different sets of tabs for each of my clients. So they automatically opens up all the things that I'm working in.
00:14:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, that's nice. Like 42 tabs open right now.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's half of what I generally have open on each of them. It's called, it's, uh, why did it just go away? I know what it's called, and it's actually just hit itself for me. Let's work Ana. So W-O-R-K-O-N-A for Chrome, and you create these workspaces, and you can save all kinds of tabs. That way, you don't have to use up all your browser memory for it. So anyway, if you don't want to have things slow down. No, not doing that. I just want to open. Okay, here we go. And now what was I looking up? I forgot what I was looking at while I was going to. My notes, very, Oh, I just wanted to get to my house. That was a patch, but I think it's Oh, the team, sweetheart attorneys. It's the name of my spreadsheet that has everybody. So, I know you have Cynthia. Unless I have to look at it. No, I have a very in John. Right. I took Cynthia.
00:15:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I used to have some gestures with Patrick now, and then I have. Jessica and Mike.
00:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike. All right. Oh, here we go. Finally. Okay. Oh, wait. Varian Johnson?
00:16:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Because you said that and then my brain went anyway. So, and then Jonathan and Jessica are the primarily Spanish team?
00:16:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Uh, Mike and Jessica are our Spanish speaker.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I gotta put these together. So, I just have it as case managers and then assistance.
00:16:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, and Mike is also a case manager, I guess. And so, but Jessica is a primary case manager.
00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
It's complicated.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see that. All right. Let me put this here also. Sometimes Google Docs add new features and I don't know that I've added it until I see it and it just did that. Okay, so, okay, now, let's talk about this. long has, I mean, so you've been with Sweet Wild like two years now, has it been two years?
00:17:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
At the end of the month.
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Let's just kind of go down the path of how your team grew when you got each person.
00:17:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yes, so I started with Mike and Jess and then Mary asked me to see if I could find someone that could work in addition to them in Arizona. Yeah, and so. I got John who was working with me at Zane's last law firm and so we had a you know three men, four men team for a little while.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long has Jonathan been there?
00:18:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
It's been a little while now, right? Yeah, he started like a month after me. That's September. And then eventually we got, see, we had it sold for a little bit and then she transitioned Tyler's team and then we are our cases just exploded and so we needed a fourth person and so we got Cynthia. Did we have someone before Cynthia? No, we had Cynthia. And then last Christmas since I just wasn't working well within the team, she just she just had a really hard time with John. So she transitioned to Patrick's team and then we got someone else I think is Mary Selah. Now we have someone else before that she like had to have a surgery and then she never came back never heard back from her and then we have Mary Selah her husband had surgery and she couldn't take enough time off at the time and so she decided to go take care of her husband and then we got very two or three months ago.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so let's talk about your team a little bit. So let me, let me kind of plan this out a little bit. I know structure and prioritization is what I wanted to talk about, but I also need to talk about the team. Just dig into them a little bit more and who they are and how they do. So Jonathan and Jessica, wait no, Micah Jessica is who you had from the beginning, right? So can you give me a brief rundown of each of them?
00:20:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Sure. So they're, they're kind of like my most experienced. case managers they're they're separately sure yeah yeah let's start with Jessica she's been here the longest she generally you know generally speaking she is she's very like self-motivated she she transferred to working from home because she moved from California to last year and it's been going pretty well you know there's she's very good her strengths are on she communicates she's very good with clients she has a very good soft touch with clients she's able to communicate things very clearly to them she's very experienced so she knows how to answer most of their questions and she has a good touch with providers as well link me with providers in the clients so So that's been her primary job duties. Lately, it seems like a lot of clients are almost set with her because she's not getting back to them. And so I've been trying to find ways to talk to her about, because she says, well, e-mail them. was like, well, the e-mail's not unlitified. So I can, I know what you've e-mailed them. And so she's like, oh, well, it didn't make it through to litify. And I'm like, OK, one time, that's fine. But this is the fifth one that somehow doesn't upload to litify. So I think there's a little bit of, she's getting married in three months, I think. So she might be a little bit distracted. And she's worked, might not be the most important thing in her life right now. So, but generally speaking clients really like her, she's getting a lot of five-star reviews and her cases usually, you know, they move through pretty quickly. The one thing I would say with a Jessica and Mike team is I'd like to see more policy limits in their cases. Sometimes I feel like, okay, this case is ready for demand and I look at the case and you know, they have Cairo and MRI's and then there's no PM recommended and I say, well, why was there an OPM recommended and they say, oh, well, it looks like the Cairo wasn't interested. So like, well, can we just kind of do a console to the PM and be like, oh, yeah, hadn't thought of that. You're my most experienced CNC, like, if you don't think of it, who knows. So, but that's, that's just, Mike, I think when I got initially, I was warned a lot about him that he would need, he would require a lot of supervision, a lot of following up. He turned out to be kind of a superstar, honestly. He was, you know, when I got him, you know, he was pretty, just kind of floating and just happy to just be there. And not too ambitious. And then I realized pretty quickly that, you know, he likes money, he likes making money. And so he likes numbers, he likes money, you know, not just money going to him, but he likes money going to the firm. And so I was like, well, do you want to help me out of distributions? And so he started, you know, some distributions, like I showed him how to do it. And then, you know, he wanted to do all the distributions for the. Jessica and Mike team and ever since he started doing them, I haven't had to reduce my fee partly ever. Whereas before, clients would have an opportunity to speak to me at distribution time and they'd be like, you can reduce the fee, it's not fair that you're taking it home more than us and try to explain that, well, you have a part of the values of treatment and all that because they're speaking to the attorney, they know I can lower the fee, but now by adding a layer, by having him speak to Mike first, it's a lot harder for them to negotiate the fee where they know Mike doesn't have that kind of authority to lower the fee for them. And Mike is very straight forward, he just tells them, look, this is basically what it is, this is a really good result and, you know, he's like, a magician, he just gets them to sign and then they'll they'll write him a five-star review, know, within the next three minutes, even though they're taking home, you know, couple of grand.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is awesome.
00:26:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does Mark know that he's got that kind of skill?
00:26:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In fact, I'm really worried because I'm worried that he's going to Mark and Mary are going to be like, well, let's put him in charge of like this team or, you know, this team's not doing well with distribution. So let's, let's put Mike in a, in a different team.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to keep Mike, he's like Mike. Yeah. Well, especially because you're the one that got, you found his spark.
00:26:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. But what you really like, I talked to him and it's not like most people really dread those distributions. and phone calls, even attorneys that I've talked to, he enjoys it. He like, this is really enjoyable for him. He the challenge, he likes the ability to calm people down and the ability to get them to really see the value that they're getting. I've been building this customer who sounds incentive structure to where, you know, when they get a distribution, I'll bonus them for that.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I love knowing that you were able to take him and find, instead of him being the problem child.
00:28:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
he's the winner.
00:28:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's, that's pretty amazing. And you, you did something for that. You paid attention and you noticed something and then you put him in the spot to, to bring that out. So good job.
00:28:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, no, I, that's like, one of the things I'm very proud of is, you know, being able to spot him because he was, you know, he kind of shows up at 10 o'clock and takes an hour and a half lunch and you know, it's easy to see him as this, you know, guy who doesn't really care, just young kid who's just there for the paycheck. But actually when you talk to him, he worked, when he's there, when he's at the audience, he works harder than anyone else. He's on the phone all the time.
00:28:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you feel like he, um, because something I've been wanting to dig into more is how many hours do people actually work and put in, um, especially within take because it's really, nobody micromanages and I'm not a fan of micromanaging, I don't agree with it. But I do believe in knowing the stats. And so how much do you think that he is he hourly? He's hourly, right?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
He's hourly, yeah.
00:29:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how much does he work each week?
00:29:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, usually I see, you know, there's not really a way for me to check on that. Michelle would know better, but you I look on the slack when they're active, you know, when their little circle is green and I would say, so he probably shows up around 9.30 between 9.30 and 10 in morning and then he leaves at five, but it takes probably an hour, sometimes little more for lunch. So, at seven hours a day, but in the seven hours that he's there, he probably outworks everyone else on the team who's working eight hours, eight and a half sometimes.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Working or outperforming or both?
00:30:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I think I know what you mean by that. You mean like there's people that are working but they're they're not producing as much.
00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it would be level of engagement, right? So I might sit at the screen and my brain wanders off or I check my Facebook on, you know, like that that's working. But now if I'm here fully engaged in task at all times, then I'm out like I'm I'm really more engaged. I'm out working somebody who's saying, know, same amount of time, we're technically logged in, we're technically at work. But you're, I'm getting, I'm actually engaged at a higher level. And, but, let's say I've got, you know, happy intelligence of this person, and in their 20 minutes, they can outperform, meaning accomplish more tasks than meet hour for hour. So outworking is efforts, outperforming as results.
00:31:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, yeah, he outperforms, I think.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay, that's some good information. Does he seem to be happy, enjoy working there, want to stay there, do you know anything about his goals and ambitions?
00:32:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I mean, I think we have a pretty good relationship and as good a relationship as you can have with someone you know, mostly meet with on Zoom and he's every time I've spoken to him, I try to have a one-on-one every month. I haven't had one last month, last month was kind of crazy, usually his feedback is pretty positive, he enjoys being there, enjoys the works he does, he likes being on the team he's in, likes working with Jessica, generally speaking and enjoys himself, I know that sometime back this was two years ago, almost when I started working there, I had spoken with him about his future ambitions and at the time he was looking to you know, going back to school for marketing or something like that, but honestly I can't I think he's settled again. enjoys what he's doing. of course, I don't have a crystal ball. can't read people's mind. Maybe he's putting on a show so that he still has that freedom to do whatever he wants.
00:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guess if he does want to go back to his marketing, but he looks pretty There's usually some signs and running on the wall that a person is checking out, like what Jessica seems to be doing, but it could be situational, like preparing for writing or whatever. There will be some sort of indicator that there's a problem, not necessarily what the problem is, but that there is a problem. And so if somebody, you know, if he's showing up and he seems to be happy and his performance continues to at least maintain pain itself, if not improved. That's a pretty good indicator that what he's telling you is true. So, you have one-on-ones with everyone once a month?
00:34:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I try to. Yeah, again, June didn't happen.
00:34:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how important is that to you? And do you know how it's just your people?
00:34:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, it's kind of my way to keep a near on the ground because I have a team that's one of John here in Arizona, Jessica and Utah. have Varian Mike in California. So, it helps me kind of know where they're at, know how they're feeling, if they're feeling overwhelmed. ask them pretty, I don't just ask them how you do it. ask them, you know, as your caseload, you feel like you have too many cases right now. Do you feel like you're overwhelmed? Do you need me to shift some cases to the other team? Do you think? think, you know, what do you think of the way the team is going? you think we're headed in the right direction or do you think if you were in charge, would you make changes? Things like that. So I feel like that gives me a pretty good temperature of how they're doing, but again, you know, if they're lying, there's no way for me to be able to tell.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:35:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
But I enjoyed it a lot. gets me to, you know, that's how I'm able to kind of steer them in a direction. I think they'll be more successful.
00:35:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you feel like you missed those meanings?
00:35:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I did January, February, March. I don't remember if I did April, I did May, and then do June.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and why did they not happen?
00:36:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
In June, we had, we did a lot more, I think we did a lot more case reviews and so I felt like I didn't want to overload the team with meetings, but at the same time honestly I just got swept away in the end of the month, subtle medicine, didn't plan well enough, didn't schedule far enough in advance.
00:37:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you feel like you come back from those meetings with, um, value that it was valuable that you had that conversation.
00:37:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Which meetings the one on once.
00:37:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:37:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I feel like there's value every time.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like they feel like it's valuable.
00:37:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I don't know if I would venture into knowing what they're thinking I think. You know, I try to make it to help them feel heard I try to help them feel like this is their time to kind of like address on the issues. Um, but.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often does somebody bring up an issue? Or even just tell you, hey, I like this or I'm having a problem with this or this is frustrating, whatever, do you feel like something like that comes up every meeting? We're trying to get a temperature of, you know, the value of the call to them.
00:38:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Right, I see what you're saying. Yeah, not everyone always has issues, but some issues came up like at one point, we were doing full team meetings. Mark had asked me to do full team meetings every day. And at one point, you know, they voiced that it was just felt very superfluous. Like there's no, not a lot of value in those. And so we restructured that. There is also point time where Jess and Mike felt like their caseload was a little high so I shifted some cases over to the other team. That was back in March, I believe. And there was a, well, this was some time ago now, but back with Cynthia in December, you know, she talked to me about the fact that she had her just a really hard time with John wasn't able to connect very well within, wasn't able to understand his style and that she would rather just have her own cases than have to work with John.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That came about from my one-on-one meetings? Yeah, it was a one-on-one So What I'm trying to get to is, do we need to build a system for you to have these scheduled in as non-negotiable and, you know, fail-safe if it doesn't happen, because the message that you send is that that is not a priority thing, if it's not scheduled regularly, and it's reactive rather than proactive. And if there is a tool or a process or system that you use that generates good results, then it needs to be done consistently. Now maybe it's every other month, maybe it's quarterly, but I think once a month, especially with our remote team, is not too much. you can do in order to have it not be overwhelming, and what is the most amount that a person
00:41:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
consistently. They're all hourly, right?
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average? What's the what's the high low over under on how much they work per day? Weekly.
00:41:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Weekly high is let's say 40 low would be 34, 35.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so being in your one on one calls last how long?
00:41:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, they usually schedule for 30 minutes, but they usually go over.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's an indicator that it needs to happen. If there's enough conversation to be happening that it's going over, there's got to be some mutual need and wants there. So that's a sign for you to be able to read. I will tell you, having worked 100% remotely for 22 years, that's. monthly is not overdoing it by any means. It doesn't matter how educated, how corporate, how higher level it is. That one-on-one time is, especially if it's consistent and they know it's there for them, is going to have higher value. They will know that there's going to be a time to bring up an issue. They will also know that there's a time where they're going to be asked and held accountable for how things are going, if that's what it gets used for. But we know that humans perform better with consistency and with structure. So your job as a leader is to make sure that you provide that. Anything that you have deemed as something worth doing with any kind of frequency needs to be done intentionally. thematically consistently be scheduled, not let's see if I can squeeze it in, or we're overwhelmed and so we're not going to do it all. Now, there generally is a pace to to the cases throughout the year. It's much more consistent now because we're working really hard on the lead generation so that we try to be giving a consistent amount of cases. But, you know, you can look at what people are working on and do your best to move things around and balance out the workload, but at the end of the day, whatever wiggle room you have should be, maybe we can move it from this state to this state on this week. And maybe we can cap it at 30 minutes, but what's not negotiable is we're not not doing it. And you can give. the timeframe of this week, hey, pick a day this week, but but really, it should be a study on the first Tuesday of every month, or second or third of whatever, a specific day of the month, a specific time of the month that is committed to. Now, if somebody is going on vacation, gonna have a baby do it, like all those different types of things that you reschedule for, you don't just not have it unless we're talking about like maternity leave or bereavement, and they're gone for a long time, bereavement is not that long. But anyway, but maybe that's a time where, you know, you do give a little extra time. Other than that, so vacations you know about ahead of time, and you can look at that and go, Oh, you want vacation during this time, that happens to be when we're having our review call. So let's have our review call ahead of time, or have it after, and maybe we'll make it a little. shorter because it's going to be closer to both the either either the first review before it or the one after Depending on where we're moving it right if we're moving it up or we're moving it back Um, but we don't want to not have it what you also can do Is and you can you can try this out, but what you can do is create that framework and kind of replicate it through email only Under extreme circumstances where somebody's going to be gone for a large chunk of time Where it doesn't make sense to just not cancel that one? So what you do is an email version in lieu of and these are the questions that I would ask you um I like to give people an option of sending me an audio message if they don't want to type it up um, so and and With your team attorneys typing writing is probably not an issue, but basically the thing is you you want to create a format where they're going to still be open and share as much with you as possible. So, like if you have a Slack channel, you can say, hey, we're going to go ahead and have this week's, this month's meeting because of extenuating circumstances, right? other time. Otherwise, it's prioritized. We're having it. It's the normal way. I'm going to ask you one question at a time. You shoot me back your response. Then I'm going to send you the follow up. Then what we're going to do is have an equivalent of about 30 minutes of back and forth chats so that we've connected so that I know where you're at, so that you know I care about where you're at and that I'm we're checking in. But basically, you always want to keep that connection and you want them to know it's really important to you, that they're really important to you. But also, you need that finger on the pulse. You need to be able to gauge them consistently. You know, because you can tell people change how they're talking a little bit, plus when you add that how they're showing up. If you ask them, how are you feeling about this, and then you get a pause, you know, there's probably an issue. There's a lot of different things that you can read, and if you're not having those one on one conversations, then you're missing out on that. So I love that you're doing it. I think that you should absolutely prioritize it and make sure it does happen every month. And I would like you to ask them, and you can send it in email and say, you know, this is the reason I have these calls. This is what I would like to get out of it. I would love to know if you find any value in it, and if so, you know, do you appreciate about it, appreciate about it, and is there something you think that we could do better? we Is there there something something do do you would like to see we discussed, like maybe there's a question I don't ask you, you wish I would ask you and give you an opportunity to discuss something that maybe I'm not creating a space for, especially with Viri. So let's talk about her for a minute. Leading the conversation. So now you do, do you have everybody on a group team meeting anymore at all?
00:48:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No. I just meet with John and Viri and I'll be with Mike and Jess.
00:48:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the other, they don't interact with anybody else, right? It's just John and Viri and just Mike and Jessica with you, right? No? Okay. All right, that makes sense. So, John and Viri, tell me a little bit about running out of time. That's okay. Quickly a little bit about John and Barry. Let's just do John because I have enough to work with Barry for right now.
00:49:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay. Yeah. you know, John, I knew him at Zane's. Um, we're, you know, we're, we're good friends. Um, he, uh, he's very, very good with clients, very, very good in crisis crises, out fires. Um, generally really, really appreciate him. Um, and he's getting better at doing, getting distributions, not quite as good as Mike. Uh, and so I, I counted like, this is more of an ad hoc thing where I still do a lot of the distributions, but he'll, he'll do a few, And that's fine that you know, I don't mind doing it He Sometimes He he hyper focuses on things sometimes And things that should take like five minutes taken 45 minutes And so Can feel a lot of times like you're stretching through mode Do you have perfectionists? Does he have any kind of OCD? He has he has ADHD And I have a kid with ADHD so I can't get it and My wife has it too It's it's pretty common for them to hyper focus and just kind of get lost in the in the details and so So we've found some ways to manage that. I think I'd like him to test the consistent, know, being able to, like, I'm very much a guy that, like, I have 42 tabs open. I know exactly what's on all the tabs. As soon as I get an email, I respond right away. You know, and I kind of like, that's how I work. I bounce from thing to thing, and then by the end of the day, all those things have been resolved. And John works differently where, like, he can only have one tab open at the time. know, before he gets a phone call, there's a client that calls, he needs to use the file for, like, five or six minutes before he takes the call. And that's sometimes little bit too slow for me. my liking, but I also understand we have different styles, we have different ways of organizing ourselves. And yeah, same thing, he gets lot of five-star reviews, clients love them. In fact, a lot of times I'll be talking to a client and they ask if they can talk to John instead. So that's always a good sign as far as I'm concerned. Wow.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, it depends on what the values are. It's a good sign that clients like him, but for example, 28 years ago, somewhere around there, was working in a call center and we had Apple Computer and Intel and lots of high-tech companies. The people that customers loved the most, made us the least amount of money and generally ended up getting fired. They had poor call control skills. They couldn't focus on what mattered most. People, it's not social. power. We have a goal to accomplish and the thing is the client's goal is to get their money. That's really what it is. But people also, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? They need communication. And if they found somebody who will talk to them and make them feel good, they may call just a chit chat and just the update. If you were to go listen to his calls, you may find that they go up the rails and talk about things that don't actually matter. And that's a coaching issue. It sucks because that's a part of human needs is to have that social connection. Um, but there's a time and a place for all things. So, you know, getting those needs met has to happen. And maybe, but like everything else, sort of, it starts with awareness. And, and then it starts, and then, and then you add in values. So if he becomes more aware that really the best way to serve them isn't to be their buddy and their friend and make them feel happy, but it's to get their case closed and get them the biggest settlement possible, that that's actually the best way that he can serve them and that by taking too much time with each person, he's actually neglecting other people that he also likes and wants to take care of. So just having the awareness and doing kind of that mathematical equation of if there's not like, there's only so much time I have, there's so many cases that I have. If I'm spending so much time on things that are really irrelevant, enjoyable, pleasant, but irrelevant, I don't have enough time to actually get to the things that matter. And maybe he's He's never really assessed that, and maybe he hasn't assessed it in a way that makes him feel better about saying, about redirecting a call. You know, when somebody wants to tell them about their cat that died, or, you know, whatever problem they had that day because it happens. People get on the phone with a compassionate person, and maybe they get a text message that reminds them, I got to go do this, and then they talk about it. And then somebody goes, oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. And then they might ask a follow up question like, are you okay or whatever, and you open a door that needs to not be opened.
00:55:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. Yeah, I think when I was at the public defender's office years ago. They said there's like four types of attorney, there's like the, the warrior, the, you know, The advocate, and then they forgot what what all they are, but one of them is a social worker. Yeah. You know, go knock on your door to make sure you're okay and, you know, find a babysitter for your cat while you're in jail and stuff like that and that's, yeah, it's not as helpful as might think.
00:56:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then that goes back to what is the end goal and what is the priority. So, we have the word priorities as a plural now, but when the word was first created, there was no plural. It was just one, there's a priority, a single primary goal. So, having conversations like that might be helpful. And I think you have the soft skills to be able to kind of massage that conversation. And because, first of all, it takes time to make change. That's a personality that, you know, are habits that are ingrained in his personality. And so to go against that would be to violate his internal values. us. He's taught that he actually has conflicting values, which most of us do and aren't aware of it. The conflicting value would be I want to take care of this person. I want them to feel good, but to take care of them, I need to get my job done and ask these questions and get them to answer them because I also want to take care of these people. And when I talk to them about things that aren't related to the case, I'm actually failing to serve them in the way that I want to. So is it being their friend of the higher priority and being friendly, or is it serving them to the best of my ability, meaning getting the case resolved at the highest level possible, and is it timely amount or is possible?
00:57:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So I'm thinking about maybe asking my how many cases he touches each day. And kind of seeing and asking John the same question and seeing if we can move them out so that. Because another thing is he's been requesting a lot of over time to catch up.
00:58:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm wondering if that's the reason why he needs to catch up because. Oh, John is asking you for time to catch up so above like 40 hours like what do you mean.
00:58:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I don't approve anything Mary does but usually asked for like six or seven hours on Saturday.
00:58:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you think it's been trying to milk things so he can get over time.
00:58:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No, I don't think so. I generally think he needs it to catch up. will just jump. 41.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Let's keep working. I as we go.
00:59:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I know we need to wrap up, but. Right.
00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time flies. That's a good thing though. That means we're getting some good work done. So, Viri, I don't want to jump the gun, so I don't want you to go have a conversation that you're not ready to have, but I think you can. And basically just kind of feel it out. I think you have enough awareness in you to direct the conversation. and it doesn't have to be a big long one. Basically, the change will come as a result of you consistently sending the same message, both with what you say and with what you do. So if you say, this is a safe place for you to talk and I'd really like to know what you think about things, how you feel like there's ways that we can improve. I want to know what you like. I want to know what doesn't work well. I think you've got a lot of experience and but I notice you don't really talk about it much and I feel like that we're under utilizing you or under serving you or both because of that and I'm wondering if maybe you just don't feel like this is a place where you can talk and I want you to know that it not only is it safe for you to do it, but it's wanted and just see what happens, just be quiet and let her kind of go from there. You don't want to just keep beating it down. And then if she ever says anything, that is like, I can't believe you just said that. It's so negative. It's so bad. It's so whatever. have to just be able, and I think that you're, I think you have this ability. I've never seen it, but I would assume you have this very well where you can just go, okay, let me think about that for a little bit and get back to you because that was a lot. And I want to give you the respect and honor to give you an appropriate response. And since I don't, I don't have it the moment, but thank you for sharing and encourage it. Because the first time you say you're safe and she's not, that's done. So one of the things that you have to do, and this is something I do with anybody that matters to me, but my star started my practice with my kids, and they're the most volatile. So it's the hardest, and it's the best way to practice, which is kind of that poker face of they're about to say something, and I know I don't want to hear it, and this is hard, and just like, and they're like, okay, I am not going to react to this. matter of fact, I'm going to drop my voice a little bit, I'm going to get softer, I'm just gonna, okay, okay, okay, I need to talk about this a little bit later, maybe tomorrow, you know, process it, although I can't imagine there's going to be something that's that difficult, but just in a leadership role where you want to have people tell you everything, you have to practice how you respond to it receive it so that if they happen to tell you when you're having a bad day, when you're at a time, When you're hungry, when you're tired, because these are the things that make Tina a bear. Do not want to tell me bad things when I'm hungry and tired. It's not going to be good. So just make it a reflexive response to take a bee and just take it in. And then, okay, I'm going to come back to this and do that. But, you know, for people, scattered, working remotely, different personalities, different paces, different skillsets, all of these different things. But you're still trying to work within a single organization with a common goal. That's no small thing. But, certain things, certain types of systems, certain functions done consistently can help you be able to get the best results. it's knowing your people, it's communicating with them. frequently, having a set of company values. And the company can have pods, you know, within it, right? you and your four people are one, but also you and each are one also, separate ones within, so organizations within organizations. And making sure that the internal values of the pods, the smaller the pod is, the more refined those values can be, the more detailed they can be, because there's less people, right? All of those need to be compatible with the larger company goals of, you know, great communication, being honest, being reliable, caring about the customers, the clients. That is definitely, I think, a value in sweet lies. Most people really care about the clients, and they want to take care of them. I don't think... think everybody does. But I know that Mark cares about that. He wants to be one of the good guys, you know, and he works, and he wants people that work for him that are the good guys. That's unique. That is a unique part of your culture. I think that stands out, especially in the industry, that you specifically are in in personal injury. So, you know, lots to talk about, lots to do, and it's the consistent effort. It's the proactive. We didn't get to really talk about the morning and how you started. But I'm really looking forward to that next week, because I think next week is when we're combined again. So, it should be Monday at 3 o'clock, which I've not scheduled. I need to do that.
01:05:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Let me open up my calendar.
01:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just Let me do this real quick. If I don't do it right now, I might forget. And actually, I'm going to duplicate my gosh, go away. I'm going to duplicate. I'm going to move it to Monday at 3pm is what we discussed, right? Sure. I'm going repeat weekly on Mondays and we'll reschedule as needed. Oh wait. Okay. Good. That's that. So we'll just keep working on it. Now, if you have questions, if you have thoughts throughout the week, if you want to run anything by me or just share something or just an insight, feel free to send an email. We could have a Google Doc that's just kind of a back and forth journal about notes. So maybe you don't want to send an email and just like here's some notes or discussion. discussion points for the next week, you can delineate whether or not you want it to be the one on one conversation we have, or think that it might be useful to bring up with with Patrick. So you can just kind of like run it by him. So we can all kind of, you know, benefit from each other. But we will get into the flow of like that structure. But I'm thinking about you guys all week long. So, you know, if there's anything coming up, I would rather hear about it, or at least make sure that you get it out of your brain and captured. So we don't forget to discuss it on the next thing, because a lot of the time that intuitive stuff just comes when it comes. So if you don't capture it, then you could lose something that was really valuable and helpful. So I do want to make sure that you capture it and shoot it off to me. It's not going to bother me.

Good to see you Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I was. How are you?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, how are you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. I'm good. So much going on. I'm going to need to see if we can move this call, though, because we're getting into school time, and this is when the kids get in school right now. She's in theater camp, but it's the same thing.
00:00:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's getting around the same time. Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a time on Tuesdays that would work for you?
00:00:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Tuesdays. Yeah, we can do either Tuesday. Uh, or we can do it around like four here.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that it's the four PM ish, like the late afternoon. uh, can really move this thing around. I can probably do it too. Two. Um, well, this was the first one that you said one one. Yeah, I can make that work.
00:01:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me see. Let me just email Patrick real quick. This is you. I just don't want to forget to do this. So I need to take up our time with it, but, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, You Okay, let me get that off there. All right, so How's things been going since we spoke last week?
00:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. I What started out, you know, was a pretty bad month Finished off as a pretty decent month You tree above $100,000 settlements. That was good. was, it felt good. The team was definitely a little bit down by, you know, two weeks ago. Everyone was a little bit exhausted trying to chase down some more settlements. Everyone was kind of stressed out and then the hard work paid off. So everyone felt pretty good about them.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Job. How did they feel about the new incentive program?
00:03:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You mean the bonus structure? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they like it. It's just, you know, we have to get the money in to make it money.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify? Let me go open. And then if I see the report I want, I guess we'll do, oh yeah, Patrick said yes, all right, thank you guys, you guys are awesome. Well, that's going to be, I'm definitely going to need my brain on that one though, because I have to move multiple, and that's really easy for me to mess up, and I don't want you guys to get a billion emails up, oops, from one, sorry, oops. Oh, what am I going, oh yeah, let's apply. Me and browser taps, Lorenz. Alright, we're reaching to the choir. Equals, last month, because we are in August, refresh. Is that the one I want, I might want a different report. If you were going to go check your numbers, what would you do in Linify?
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. I keep track of my own numbers on that spreadsheet. I don't particularly like Lidify. I find it pretty clunky. I can use it for what I needed to do. Anything that I want extra I just do for my own with Excel.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my god is a favorite. It's a case of science. That's not what I want. Probably do you want my dashboard?
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It means reports.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which one I want. So edit this one real quick. It's not going to be what I Let's see if this one grows last month. Because the reports, I don't want to have to go to multiple reports, so I want to go to one of my dashboards. So, cases, attorney fees, actually, so, your, that's my state, don't want to buy a state, don't want buy team. Cases close my team, I want to add, okay, gross fee by team, that can't be right.
00:06:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I also don't know how often I guess those reports get updated.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One other good update as soon as I run it, if I hit refresh, which I did. You didn't just get 92,000 and then attorney fees last month, right?
00:07:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it was the attorney fees was pretty bad.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I think that can't be right either. So drop out subouts. What's other? I have dropped outside the data is two and then other is 30. Oh, 30 of 32 for two minutes. Hmm. Now we choose to. Let me go back to Mark's notes. So $1 million in and settlements $3 million, okay. So I just look at team brands, well I'm just going to click on you that should do it. Let me show my screen so I'll be looking at the same thing. Sure. Okay, okay. I'm to zoom out of my way here. I'll probably shrink this up a little bit so I can see. Oh, what am I looking at? Time period. It's probably for a month filter last month. I want to look at. Last time through. No. I'm not going to. I'm Save and run. Where's there an error? Filter, the friends. Get rid of that. I already have that. Save and run. That won't give it to me, that's not going to do it. I'll do it for this year. It equals this year. Refresh. It doesn't matter if it's my It's gross to turn me face by team. Okay, now we have just you. Which is not, oh, I think I messed up the report. That's okay, I think I fix it. Ummm. It must just be this, nope, I already clicked on a map to get one of them. I'm just going to discard that and go to a different report, see if this will work. I want to see your stats month over month this year. That's what I'm looking for. Let me do that. me go to, let's see, I don't know what matters. I don't want to turn a fees. Turn a fees this month. a fee by attorney. Oh, it's a mark reports. probably can't see it. Oh, that's everybody. I just overlook you completely. I'll see you. Tyler, Samantha, Patrick, Hank. What's this? That's a time of program. All right. What do you, how do you track your numbers?
00:12:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, with an Excel spreadsheet. Can I see what you've got? Sure. So this is how I track my settlements, my money in, I use, basically use Michelle's reports that are in Google Sheets, this is my settlements, I keep track of how many I get, keep track of the other settlements and I have not every month since last August, so I don't the name.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand why they're, like, do each of those attorneys, attorneys, have they worked on that case?
00:14:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, The name is just for me. I don't keep track of the name of cases that the other attorneys settle. I just keep track of their numbers so that, you know, I can see where I stand.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are, what are the line items then for everyone?
00:14:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So this is right here. This is my own box.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's like the cases I settled last month. This is right here.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then these are these are these numbers represent cases and settlement amounts. Also for them, just not named.
00:14:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't, I don't keep track of names for them.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that makes sense. was just. Okay. No labels, okay. So then the totals. And this is settlements, not attorney fees.
00:15:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is July settlements and attorney fees. I have the records.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So before we get into that, can we just go ahead slowly go through June, go through each month real quick.
00:15:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just take a peek at what you've got. So this was June. A lot of cases settled, but not a lot of big ones.
00:15:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And your target for settlements is three million a month, right?
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For settlements. Three million, that's the firm goal.
00:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brown goal. Okay. What is your, what is the pod goal?
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I've been setting it up 600,000.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not have one for you guys like on a pod level?
00:16:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No. Well, he's never expressed a specific pod goal. When I first started, he said my your break even number is you need to make $110,000 in fees every month. But since then we've hired new people. So I'm sure it's higher than that.
00:16:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and if it's not, it's going to be. Okay, so July, can you share on me July one more time, please? Okay, and May. And April. Can I see Megan? Oh, wow. Okay, April and March. Okay, December. Do you know how to tabulate across worksheets?
00:17:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've tried playing around with it and I can figure it out.
00:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind sharing this with me? We can work on it and do a tabulation real quick? I know I do that. So share it, Tina at ProfitDrivers Inc.com.
00:17:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
See you now.
00:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At ProfitDrivers Inc. Okay. Send that and then I will open it in ScreenShare and then I'll create a completely new tab so it doesn't mess with anything. We just get that. Wait for it to come. wait where are you asking me to log in a Microsoft?
00:18:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is that a Microsoft thing?
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay see if then should be able to do that because that is my Microsoft account. All right cool. It's in there, I'm going to you Windows on my way zoom. Okay, so we're going to create a new one here and we need this to So do we want tools? No, we don't want tools. want that. We just want average name So then we'll just do the same. We'll take these. I'm just actually going to do this for a minute Okay, so we're that big enough to see. Okay, and we're going to uh we actually don't need any of this oh my gosh can i pick the right thing please all right delete these rows and okay i don't want to delete them yet so i actually want this to be really rent and i want it to here i want it to be average and it's going to be of you that um i think you have to do comma oh let's see you Yeah, that should work, right? And then this comma, that comma, that. So you would just change this formula by adding the next sheet every month. And then that should work. So that's your average. And then we're going to drag these, drag this over seriously. So that's your average. Now we can. Oh, sorry. Hopefully I can delete that without messing with the formula. Let me check the numbers though first.
00:22:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How does Hank's average $900,000?
00:22:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. now that's when you go double check everything. Did Hank even exist back here?
00:22:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was marks that used to be marked. That's fine. Yeah. So we got it. That's the other things. We got to make sure it followed the same formula. So A, B, C, D, E, F would have to be the same across the board. Otherwise we just go and do them regularly. And so this is not correct because you will actually, it might be because I might have done it right. Hold on. So this is A, is B, B, B, B, B. Okay, so, so we can't drag this across. We just have to go do it manually. So you should be, yeah, we can't because of Mark, Nick, and Hank. They moved, and Robert even.
00:23:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, Robert.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you could do this, or if you want to spend time real quick, we could go do this manually. took like a whole minute, I think, for each row, then we'll have that data.
00:23:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd like to see how I stack up. Yep. Okay, so we got to average, and then you go to the cell that you want. And so this is Tyler's. You want to make sure that we're getting that correct, and then we put a comma.
00:23:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they make you the same format every time.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that would be the way to simplify this. If you wanted to create a new one next year or whatever, but this really doesn't take that long. to go through it. You just want to make sure that you're in the correct cell for the correct person to get the right thing. And then after you've chosen the cell, you enter a comma. Oops, there's a space. Don't mess up that syntax. And then put that word belongs and then go to the next one. And we're in Tyler. So Tyler and Samantha are that way.
00:24:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And then now they switch.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now we're October and I need Tyler. And then November. Tyler is D. Comma December. Tyler is still D.V. Comma January. He's probably that way all the way through it. We're going to make sure Tyler. make sure I missed February here somehow.
00:24:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have anywhere. You missed February.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing? Okay. So April, Tyler, there, comma, May, Tyler, June, and July, May, June, July, and turn, and that should be Tyler. So, now we'll go to Samantha, and okay, so maybe it took two minutes, but still it's good.
00:25:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's because we're noticing some issues at the same time.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
August is Samantha, I just want to make sure, because this looks a little bit, I guess it's just because it's so full on her line, oops, comma, Samantha, to go over to Samantha's Bee, November, I'm to go Samantha's Bee. Let's see, should I get my comp, okay, December, Sam, September, January, my ADD, and I really have to focus the comma, March, Sam. And there's no February, wait, yet January, March, Thank you, bye. I'm on a call. April, Samantha, we have April, so we're now going to May, comma, June, July. You ready for this? That's our average. Yep. And Patrick's and maybe do you want to get these guys yet?
00:27:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're concerned about Sam and Yeah. So now, now let's do a little bit of a difference. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to. Difference between. And. And. And then we'll do Tyler. Tyler. So it's going to be. I'm going to do this. I got to make it the same thing. So it's going to be. Equals. This minus this. And then equals this minus this. So that should be a negative number. This is how much more you are above Tyler on average and Tyler's been around longer than you hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah, Tyler's.
00:28:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's been around forever.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was minding her mouth for a minute. I don't do that very often, but I remembered I should. So, I mean, so I want to look at that as a percentage. What percentage of that? So, going to do this equals this. That can't be right. No, so it's it would be this divided by that. And I would just formulate it as a formula, no, not formula, uh, format, format, cool away, whoa, percentage. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay, and this equals that divided by that, and I'm gonna copy and paste special formula normally. So you're 132.6% out of the entire average over since August, so that's that's not quite as bad. She is, she is, she, she doesn't. Now kids, um, she's a workhorse and she is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's not a derogatory thing, but, but she's built differently. And that has to be taken to account.
00:30:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Uh, I mean, no, I, and, you know, I'm, I I'm, I'm supposed to be the nice guy, the, you know, the dad with kids, but I'm pretty competitive too. And I, I have been chasing her for the better part of the last year.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to, let's, let's, sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. This is my brain.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Please continue. Sometimes I get close, but, you know, it seems like she gets, uh, you know, well, you know, sometimes it feels like, you know, she settled, you know, one month, she settled like 30 cases. I'm like, you know, I was pretty happy with settling 23 cases that month. It's, it's just no matter what I do, it seems she's always like a step ahead, you know.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's other things that we have to look at, but she, she just, I mean, she just, she's exceptional and, uh, but there are other values that get, oh, that's one time I'm on second. Hi. Amazon, her way to get to you. And she's, she's in cosplay, so, um, fun with that. And I'm going to call. That's why she can't to you. Oh, sorry. I just, I can't get it. No, you're, you know what the pollage is for coming up. just want to make sure that you know. I'll see you when you get home. Bye. She picked up from theater council. She'd be fine that she's like and she didn't know she was gonna go dress go pick her up What's our mental name? Miriam who I like that. That's a good good biblical name November Moses's sister Good Am I in December? I'm in December Patrick. See getting my brain back on track. It's a little bit of work Okay, January Patrick That's what I'm doing right December January. That's the right thing seriously March Patrick is coming That's quite a number isn't it? But I know he gets Mark's cases so Yeah Yeah, this is definitely not apples to apples June but it's still in the number so and pretty soon it's going to be more apples to apples June july okay so we do that wait minute what went wrong august september comma comma what did i do wrong here it looks correct oh it is correct okay we're not going to worry about nick is litigation right yeah i don't i don't compare that because that's just out of interest it's not how long this hink even had cases like it's a month and a half all right let's just go I didn't get him in there, so there's the formula. We're just going to not do these guys and they don't even need to be in there because of that. Hank, we're going to drive. Oh, here's my little. Hey, I dragged you. Oh, you're just slow. Okay. Average. And let's see. Hank was June and then comma and July. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and put him in here too. And that way we'll just watch that trajectory because you know you don't want them getting in front of you, right?
00:34:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been watching him. I've been keeping track of him. I've been keeping track of the cases that. He's getting to, why is he getting the broken arm one?
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, that's intake, really, isn't it?
00:35:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of it is intake. I think some of it is also like, it's like a slam dunk. It doesn't make much business sense for Mark to like give it to me, and then I don't miss on it where I can give it to Hank, or who doesn't bonus, and then the fee can go straight to the firm instead of part of it going to my balance.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But does Mark, I mean, he doesn't have that much to do with intake, does he? Unless they specifically ask him?
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think he does. I've talked to, a of it event, but who gets the cases as far as thought.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was that before, so I want to ask and understand it again. I'm here to say, I'm here to say something. Yes, but that is something I've already been trying to dig into. So it's not necessarily motivated by the call. It's just this call. It's just like reiterated. I really want to understand that. Okay. So then. I love though that you've been tracking your number. July, July, July was above your average.
00:36:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but not money in. So yeah, it was a good month.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to get a good August as far as fees. Yeah. So let's do that now. What's, let's, I'll stop sharing and you could share your attorney fees with me.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, attorney fees, I don't, so I keep track of it through Michelle's reports. So that'll be.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But are those not just monthly or something?
00:37:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's my. Commission reports. Share this with you. Are you. Share. You see that? Yeah. So this is, it's all dated down here. I don't know. All the fees for this year.
00:37:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, oh, that's going to be a lot of numbers to look at, balanced, cover based balance, do balance, do a sweet lot. Can you break this down for me a little bit?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so really what you're looking at is firm fees right here. That's the money I bring in. This is my commission's right here. And then, so really this is the number that matters as far as like what I think we're talking about.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just for a two week period?
00:38:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, this is, yeah, two week period at the time.
00:38:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. do you have, do So, attorney fees target is what, and is it by Sweet Law or POD?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's by Sweet Law.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is that across the board monthly?
00:39:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
1 million, I believe.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's the 1 million, and then the settlements are 3 million, right, across the firm?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you only see your report?
00:39:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I can only see my report. I mean, Mark posts them on the week before the end of the month, but he hasn't done it on the last day of the month in a long time, so we don't really know who wins.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know if this is correct. So, let me go look at something really quick, dashboards. That's average, I want to total gross attorney fee by team. Let see manners, manners by owner and status active manners by, I don't miss that we want active principal attorneys to kind of figure out which report. Or look at me attorney fees. Let see if that will turn the fees this month. I should be able to customize that by... So, Mark does show you everybody's stuff is just not at the end of the month, right? Yeah, so it's not up to date. Okay, so then I'm going to take that as the sign that it's okay to look at everybody's fees.
00:41:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you see it, you just don't see. It's just the timing thing. Yeah. So it's not a privacy thing. Okay, so, oops, I almost ended the meeting. Share. I'm going to take over sharing.
00:41:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll stop sharing.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. I'll share... Get these out of my way again. Oh my gosh. Grab the window. That's not the right thing. Okay. So this is for... This says... yeah, I don't want to change this for... It should be last month. This hot-time custom. Last month. Oh, run. Yeah, save it. That's good. Okay, so the runs... that's not right. Wait, so that's not right. That's right. That's what I'm looking for, that's empty. So that's not right. All right.
00:43:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
that's what I don't like about that if I never does what you think it you want it to do. Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's what I need a note to solve. Okay. Let me go back to my notes here. All right, so we talked about scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings for your people.
00:44:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they're coming up again.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they're monthly, right? So did you just tell them, hey, this is going to be monthly.
00:44:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is going to happen every single month now? Yeah, so then it's going to happen every single month. If we need to reschedule, we're it right away kind of thing. It's not like push it out to the next month. And I think we, yeah, that's what we had discussed regarding those. And then also set goals with them. And then set goals with them, follow up with each goal. I take notes of their goals and try to follow up with these goals.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So did you create like a call agenda for those things so that you have something just to go through line item by one?
00:45:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have this. I don't know if that's but it's the same format for everybody. It's not like kind of taking notes as they you know ramble on this. It's a bunch about the same format but I I need to digitize it maybe set it to them in advance too so that they can prepare for the meeting so they're not just like uh uh uh.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah I think that that would be best because it helps mentally for that exact reason right? It helps kind of anchor them to what the purpose of the meeting is and you'll probably have a more effective meeting if everybody has the agenda even the agenda is the same thing every time, know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing. Once you get there, now it's on your mind. But you really want them to be thinking about it ahead of time. So they're not searching for the answers. They've been thinking about it, formulating it, putting into the most articulate way so that you can really comprehend what they're trying to express. And maybe just even so they are able to find the words because sometimes you can have a thought and it's kind of ambiguous in your head. know, not really clear, a little fuzzy. So in just a reminder, and maybe it could be something that you automatically schedule. So let's say it's a calendar invite on Outlook and you have a specific invite that goes out to Viri and inside of the invite, here's the notes, here's the agenda because it's the same every time. And just a reminder in the calendar invite. I think in Outlook you can probably as well, how the reminders go out like in Google, can say day before, hour before, whatever, and have multiple ones. So the reminder would show up and it would show the agenda and just reminder, please review the agenda, be thinking about these questions in advance, and then when you get to the call, ask them, did you review the agenda, did you think about these questions in advance? Yeah, because you want them to be doing their part to make sure that the call is and their meeting is as effective as possible. And that is not a second thought, but it is the priority or an afterthought, that's the word I meant. Okay. So, can you read me your agenda?
00:48:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I write down everything and so I end up with like no books.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is another reason to digitize it with a really clear title so you can find it. Yeah. Because I'm the same way and I've learned that the more those grow, the less helpful they are.
00:48:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Yep. And I don't throw them away either. So, I just, yeah. So, first we start with, you know, basically, how are you doing? Well being kind of questions like how you do feel overwhelmed. Do you have any major issues, any stress points right now that we can address? And then we go through the basically stress points from the client's end and then stress points from the firm end to see if there's anything there that we can help relieve. So, for example, Jessica had from the client end, she said, like, forty percent of her time is being spent resolving PD issues for her Spanish speaking clients. And so we talked about maybe at the intake level, we can take a few extra minutes to kind of reset expectations with clients, explain to them where personal injury attorneys were, of course, going to You know, point in the right directions when it comes to PD stuff, but really our principal concern is their injuries and kind of reset expectations so that on Jessica's end she's not constantly resolving PD issues and On the firm and She says it's PD property damage property damage.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:50:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just make it sir Now the firm end Yeah, she had you know, we talked a little bit about how she's she gets really triggered and upset whenever Mark or Mary are stressed out about the numbers and stuff like that Does it feel sometimes like they're disappointed in us a lot, so She's Just gotta try to reassure her that you know mark is kind of like me We we kind of focus on what needs to be improved and Sometimes we forget to say good job, you know, we forget to Be encouraging that doesn't mean you think any less of first. Okay, I kind of reassured her there and then we moved on to the next The next section which is goals what go I asked her to give me goals for the next 30 days that she wants to accomplish and And, you know, Jessica's very like she's like, I want to do better at this and I want to do better at that Okay, but how are we gonna quantify that? How are you gonna measure that? She's like, well You know, I think overall just and I'm like, no, no, no, you need some numbers that can help you keep track of That and another question that you can ask is what does better look like? Yeah, yeah, and I did And I haven't done right here.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does better look like?
00:51:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we said some goals about you know, collecting net, you know, cases that are stuck in collecting meds. And then we want to improve policy limit cases. So one of the big issues we have on our team is that Spanish speaking clients, they just want to get done right away. They don't, they don't care about case value, they don't care about treatment, they just want to be done right away. so we're having a hard time getting policy limits on them. And so we set a goal to get, you know, try to push for 10 policy limit cases in the next 30 days. And then one of the things we wanted was more face to face meetings with Mike or her co team member, feels like sometimes they can't redo the same work. So she wants to have, she wants to touch base with them.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then at the end,
00:53:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you create a plan for that to happen or yeah, I spoke with Mike And then I spoke to the both of them setting that expectation My the issues I did not follow up like a week a week later to make sure it was happening.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's my family so But we Did you set a timeline for? Okay, so they scheduled it to make sure it's happening. So you'll follow up on the next call and and that will be your follow up So at the very least it's gonna happen within a month. I think it's reasonable because you gave two adults a You're not micromanaging, right? You gave them an assignment They're accountable for it. So, you know, I think that that's I Don't think you dropped any kind of ball by not checking to me that would be micromanaging Did you grown people do what you said you were going to do? I'm following up, yes, following up a week later, whatever, no, you've already built this. That's the whole point of being very consistent about having these monthly meetings is, you know, unless it's urgent, if there's something urgent and it needs to be addressed because it's a major morale issue or a major financial issue, integrity, that type of thing, then you need to really step in because it's not getting handled and the cost is huge, right? The liability of not addressing it is a big deal. But if it's just overall day-to-day operations, the system following up with it monthly and then two things, one, empowering your team and two, setting very clear accountability. So, okay, you guys said you were going to get this started by next week at the late. It is. That needs to be what happens. And, you know, I'll be following up when we meet next to make sure that it happens. But when you do follow up, you know, you can, there's a couple ways to handle it. If it didn't get done. Um, neither one of them have an excuse. So Jessica asked for it. If Mike doesn't show up, but she doesn't say anything. That's on her. If Mike, um, up and it's not working well, whatever, then then that's just a talk about it, but if they showed up, then then it's good. So, and if Jessica didn't show up and Mike did, then he could say something, know what I mean? So there's no, there's really no reason to be more involved in it other than to say, okay, I hear you. Here's the plan. We're going to make it happen. Let me start the conversation between the two of you so that. that you know, as your reader, that I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this needs to happen, make it happen, that kind of thing, but from here, your job is to make it happen, not, not mind. I'm not going to call you, did you talk to her, did you do this, did you have your meeting, this is the job, you said that you need this to do your job well, make it happen. If you have issues, report the issues. Otherwise, I assume it's getting done.
00:56:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what else did she say?
00:56:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So then we moved to the third section, which I call coaching, any things that I have noticed that you can use a little bit of coaching on. And last month, one of the things I noticed is that well, number one, there's a lot of time spent on non bodily injury issues, like property damage, or just like, you know, listening to your client complain. about her life and things like that so she's you know maybe spending a little bit too too much time on empathy and there's a balance right because you don't want to get subbed out every month because you're too uh too short but at the same time you know I noticed that she was missing a lot of calls because the call that she had taken 45 minutes ago was still happening uh and so kind of thing yeah same thing as John you know uh you know we talking about last time so we talked a little bit about some uh being able to set down Teresa's client even if she has to say hey I'm so sorry I have to go into a meeting right now uh you know I can check in with you in a week to see if we can um if we can get this this thing resolved and then uh the other thing is case value we discussed case value and how we can better communicate with providers to make sure that even if the client doesn't want to do pain management, well maybe we can do a consultation and get an estimate, at least I guess it's more valuable on the case than just the chiropractor and MRI. If we have an estimate for a pain management dog, then there's future that needs to be considered. Even though state farm will likely not consider them, at least they have to, at least that gives us more of an argument. And then we set a date for the next meeting and that's it. That was my first monthly meeting, my first structured monthly meeting with them, so I kept it pretty simple, but if you have any suggestion of things that we can add to that.
00:58:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it starts small, be consistent, measure the results of the start, and then you make improvements based off of what you've observed. It's entirely too, you can't think of the word, but so that is not the right word, but it's to want to go big and try to over plan and strategize and make the perfect thing, but the simplest solution is often the best solution. So trying to over plan and strategize how that should go, it is not good. Generally, it's going to stay very simple, very small, and the fine tuning comes from the content on the call with the person. What issues get revealed, what things tend to show up fairly consistently for a single person or across the board, and now what they because now we've got a pattern established, good or bad, so whatever the strengths are, you want to turn that up, right? And whatever the issues are, you want to turn that down. So it's more about creating a system for revelation of what do I not know, but what do my assets, my team know, and that's it. having our conversations, reviewing you go for calls with them and just kind of riffing off of what you learned, combine your experience with my experience, know, none of us are perfect at any of this, but, you know, two has better than one kind of thing, as long as it's a good head. mean, some people are just kind of, yeah, think Mark does a good job hiring people. for next. And it's interesting, too, because there's a variety of personalities and skills and ability, and that's one of my favorite things about it, though, is seeing the shifting across teams and how people show up differently on different teams.
01:01:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know. I think that's why I learned a lot from you last year, is to kind of play to each team members' strength and not try to force them to a square pet into just a round hole.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and not playing to their weaknesses per se, but figuring out what you can do sometimes to mitigate the weakness or, I mean, sometimes it's training, but sometimes the issue is personality and brain function, like some people's brains just don't work analytically or in the same kind of systematic way, and some cannot. deal with chaos like Cynthia, like it has to be structured or she's overwhelmed. And that's not a fault. She literally cannot choose to be a different way. So trying to compel her to be a different way, not only is it can't it's not going to be successful, but eventually that would just that could break a person. That's real depression. That's real anxiety.
01:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's real health. That's I couldn't see that. When she was on my team, I kind of could see that a little bit. She was just, you know, really getting frustrated with our style and our kind of, you know, like get it done as quickly as possible whenever you can and fit it in between function, like.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the way people procedurally do things, those things are innate and they can't be trained. You can corral a little bit, but a small percentage, whereas if you can determine what their strengths are and amplify their strengths, it's pretty easy to amplify strengths when you realize what they are with somebody and give them the resources to do that and that also will increase autonomy. Then you now have an expert who can train some things to other people. There's a whole another way about being able to take advantage of that and not everybody can. There's also a threshold for emotional pain and stress that people can handle. Like Samantha, there's no comparison, I would imagine that Cynthia and Samantha probably could not get along well at all. That could break Samantha or Cynthia. I don't know, I'm guessing, but based off of what I know about certain personality types and performances, that looks like a disaster. Samantha is not wrong for being Samantha and the way that she runs. She's not bad for it. It's just how she, then there are people who can work really, really well in that environment. But Cynthia is not wrong for how she is. She's just Cynthia. So, but we've got people who are willing to show up every day, who are willing to tell the truth and be honest, be an integrity, who care about their jobs. Those things you can't train either. They are either there or they're not. And as large as this world is, there is a shortage of those type of people who will just rather than feel entitled to a paycheck simply because they were given a job. that is a really small percentage of people and that's decreasing. So when we've got people who are willing to work, who are teachable, at least willing to be taught, there's always the mental capacity of how much somebody can be taught. Interestingly, the only person, I've only ever fired two people in my life out of hundreds for being completely unteachable on a mental, intellectual level. One of them's name was Cynthia. She was so sweet and I hated firing her, but I had to fire her because there was nothing I could do to get through to her within the capacity that I was allowed to within the corporation. But that is almost always not ever the thing. What I usually end up having to terminate somebody for is bad attitude, unwillingness to follow procedures, unwind. willingness, not inability, but unwillingness to follow procedures, the way that they treat the customers, not showing up on time, not being reliable. It was almost never a training issue, because if I could figure out what their strengths were, I could figure out how to use them well. And some everybody's got strengths. But if they don't have the foundations of showing up being an integrity, being truthful, being dependable, playing as nicely as they can with others, at least being respectful. Samantha, I think, is super aggressive, but I don't think she's disrespectful. So some people just can't handle aggressive. I'm aggressive. I've learned to tone it down, because I don't want to narrow my pool of people that I can work with. And I've been offensive unintentionally, many, many, many times, sometimes intentionally. Yes, it's the Portuguese in me, but, um, but there's also African and Filipino and all kinds of other angry people. So, wait, I'm not saying that I agree with you. Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, so having these consistent meetings, having a consistent, um, what you call it? Agenda and feedback. Let me go back to your notes. I like, um, hopefully you like that we went through and got the averages so now that you can. Yeah, I think averages is much better because it allows you to compete with yourself. Um, on a more realistic level. So there's two things that you can do. First of all, month to month, did you beat your average and also are you increasing your average because that's really what you want to see. Month to month is difficult because there's just a lot of play in the cases that you get. Yeah. And I like that you're keeping an eye on everybody else. And when you look at the averages, That's the great thing about averages is they it doesn't matter how long somebody has been there. It does because they're not given full case loads. And so you're still not doing apples and until they get full loads, right? But you're able to watch their trajectory and see how they're doing. And if you see somebody new pulling out ahead of you, maybe go like, all right, what are you doing that I'm not doing? What can I learn from you? And tapping into that knowledge base. But also you should be looking for what are you doing good? What's good about you? What are you improving on? Like really, you have to run your own race. Lorenz, because you're too, we are all too unique. We want to be inspired by our teammates, but it shouldn't be about self-deprecating.
01:08:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you know, and I struggle with that because, you know, of my thoughts and school graduated, you know, with Honors in college and, you know, got, you know, always was like at the very top. And I've been sitting in second place to Sam for a year right now. You that's bugging me.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can look at some things and we can try to break it down what you think it is, but a lot of it is probably going to be how she talks and how she communicates. And so you have to ask yourself what you value most. Do you value most being the top performer in the firm financially? Or do you value being an excellent performer in the firm and being a nice guy that makes people feel good? I'm not saying she doesn't because I don't know that makes your team feel safe. all of these values matter. So you need to decide what your most important values are and you need to rank them. When you evaluate yourself, you need to ask yourself, how did I show up on this value? How did I show up on this one? How did I show up on this one? And then month over month, did I improve on this value? Or did I at least hold steady? And then do that with all the things that matter most to you as a financial success in the company, but also in the way that you show up to your team as a leader, the way that you show up to clients. You need to measure all of the things because you're at the end of the day. First of all, we all have, we slow down, we get older, we slow down a little bit, cognitive function. There's a whole lot of things that go into play there. Having kids is a lot. It's a very difficult job. It is the best job in the world, but you can't always check that stuff at the door. Sometimes you can lose sleep over it. Sometimes what your kids are going through is popping up in your head. You're also married so whatever is going on with your wife You know and the older we get the more health issues come up and even though they're minor But all of these things like there's an accumulation That happens the older we get we care about more people We are involved with more people they take up mental space All of these things have to get taken into account and almost nobody does they're not Does not know that No, nobody does really I I'm just wondering because it seems sometimes like You know, I I want to have those values those non quantifiable values these talk about sometimes it feels like The only values that really matter at the end are the quantifiable the The You need to go have a great conversation then Lorenz and you need to say, I want to know these things. I want to know what matters. First of all, do I need to worry about losing my job and at what point would I need to worry about losing my job? And then you need to ask them what do you value and can you rank what those values are for me so that I understand it and how do you feel I show up in those values and ask them. I would like to know about the financial one. I know what those values are but I want to know are you happy with me? Are you happy with my pace? Like I know you think I can do better because I hear that all the time but what I want to know is what do you value about me and do you feel that my value is enough that if I keep going the way that I am and I'm trying to do the best I can do I need to worry about my job. If that's a concern that you have which seems that you do. Enough comes up. that I come from there's some like professional trauma that comes into it to where I know I've worked in places that you know if you have kids you're always kind of on the shopping block at then you're you're on the and no one says it but I can promise you that that's not what you have with Mark okay I promise you that I would not make a statement I wasn't confident in and it's the opposite he is very tender hearted towards families and kids and has a huge responsibility in taking care of his people as much as possible sweet lot is about the people to him I understand yeah I think that's why I'm very cautious in you know doubting him because honestly he
01:14:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
has given me no reason to to doubt him if I'm very if I'm being objective. And all of myself down actually come from my past experiences at other firms.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good to know. But you know what it markers the kind of person I think you can have that conversation with and you can blame it on me. I'm just like I'm just talking to Tina and these things are coming out and I'm realizing I've got these fears and I think they're holding me back and like like you can tell them you want to do the best that you can you can tell them what you think your weaknesses are and what you're working on you can tell them that you think your teammates some call control training which I just googled and I think that we could probably find some training even if it's through video courses. My first life was in the corporate world and a call center and tech support and when you get old people who don't know how to use a computer now this was 28 years ago so computers back then nobody plenty of friends. Everybody would be like, they thought that CD holder was a coffee cup holder. I'm not kidding you. They would say their computer doesn't work. It's not even plugged in. I'm not kidding you. That was a regular thing. So, and they were lonely and they're like, there's somebody I can talk to. No, you can't because I've got, I've got metrics I have to meet or we don't get paid. So, but if I treat you badly, then I get docked and then we lose our business because they're also measuring that. So, I had to figure out where the safe place was where I could get them out the door, they're happy about it even though they didn't get the socializing they wanted and they didn't like being told what to do, especially by a little girl, especially the men. Didn't all like that at all. It was just, you know, almost 30 years ago. So, a lot has changed since then, but that was a whole different world. Anyway, your team call control for sure could learn that. I think everybody at Sweet Law intake, especially, needs call control skills. I've been talking about this with Mark. I really just need to go find the solution for him and get people on there and training, because I think that I haven't even listened to the calls. But from what I've heard, it's got to be there's way too much allowed to happen. And there is a way to finesse a conversation so that it's handled efficiently without hurting feelings. And it still feels like care. that is a skill, and it is trainable. Everybody won't learn it as well. Anyway, so, Pondre, think about it. But if you're not sure who you're working for, I would recommend that you figure that out.
01:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I'm getting an idea. Honestly, I share those, I share this with you kind of in confidence, but also because that's You know, that's some of the feedback I'm getting from the CMs that have been here a little longer kind of, you know, they kind of get the same feeling like that, you know, they like Mark and they feel like, you know, the firms are whole values then but they It's so inscrutable sometimes, it's hard to say, it's hard to see if he thinks he's doing good job or not. And you know, I think, you know, I will have that conversation with them probably later this month.
01:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll give you one more perspective. He pays me $1,000 an hour to have these conversations with you and I have no oversight whatsoever.
01:17:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wow. Do you know anybody else that would be up for you? What's that? We should probably end this call soon we're over.
01:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I, it's not hourly. It's monthly. This is, this is my time. So it's me.
01:17:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Honestly, that that did. a lot of my confidence when we set up these calls because I know how much he values you and so if I was I know that if I was on the shopping block he wouldn't bother.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No 100% would not because there are other people that not really on the shopping block but he would not invest in. So that's also between us. Um but do you know anybody else have you ever worked with anybody else that would give you that kind of training and that kind of time?
01:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
01:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I understand that it's what you hear is get this stuff done. But um I don't know if you were listening.
01:18:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
By the way sorry for interrupting but I don't kind of the same one of the issues that I'm kind of the same as Mark is I also think about what's next. I never take the time to smell the roses.
01:19:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you really care about your people, don't you? Yeah. And you're not looking for ways to fire than you're looking for, how do I help them, right?
01:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Exactly, yeah.
01:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think that you two are, you have some similarities. There's a scripture though that says, shall know them by their fruits. How many people do you see getting fired at Sweet Law?
01:19:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I've seen in two years, I've seen one. And I've seen people leave, but getting straight up fired in one thing, because she never showed up, essentially.

That's probably pretty unique, isn't it? Yeah. How many people do you see getting suspended, terminated, like, fully berated in front of everybody? I've never seen her. And how many times have you heard somebody like complain is just about getting. two down getting threatened with our job and just high levels of stress over it. Let me just give you one more example. Cynthia is still there. I know Mark has a hard time with her too, but he still keeps her and she's easier to replace than than an attorney. So I don't tell you a lot right now. When I say you shall know them by their fruits, you can say all that you want to do and you can look like a prickly pear, but if you're soft on the inside, you know, that's what kind of fruit that we have is that at the end of the day, the people are really what matter most. The business has to be profitable for the sake of the people. What good is it to you? Sweet Law isn't profitable. You don't have a job anymore. So he has to push that. But but also tell you one more thing and then I do need to wrap up is that when we start reported this. It was supposed to be every other week. And it was mostly about marketing business building. And it was with, it was my client that Mark also works with. They were working together and he says, I need Tina in here because she does something I don't want to do, I don't do, but I need you to have her helping you. And so we got on a call and then the second week, Mark said, how do I get this weekly and how do I focus on leadership? I've never had anybody before that say, I need to work on my leadership. Now we did that, but nobody just asked and they didn't ask right out of the gate because I had asked him some questions and he and his self reflection was like, I need to be a better leader. And so he's been working on it. So I will tell you, you have a very unique person that you're working with. And if you do better because you just want to do better and make them happy but not because they're scared. That energy is different. How we operate from fear is very different than how we operate from confidence, even if we have the same exact goal. So ponder that a little bit and maybe get to know what we work for.
01:22:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's funny because I just said that's my 11 year old last night. It was just that conversation.
01:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is why we all need people that we can talk to you because we know the things but sometimes we feel to recognize where we're not employing.
01:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's me.
01:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's me. It's all of us, really. It's all of us. We have to have those people. So but when you're at the top in your area and there's really not a lot of oversight from Mark. So really you're top dog and there's not a lot of people to counsel with but also you know don't necessarily want to tell your boss everything that you're worried about, especially with previous trauma. In the standard corporate world, that's just not that's just not good for business. It's not a safe thing to do. But what I'm expressing to you is that you do have a very different situation. situation here, and I would suggest that you explore it, and then ask for advice, use mark, but I think if we keep having these conversations, just inspecting how you're doing things and making these little changes, the amazing compounding effect over time you look back and you go, wow, we're all different. And it's just because we're inspecting it honestly and bull normally every week and then making some decisions based off of that and it's pretty powerful.
01:23:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I appreciate you showing up and, you know, not being like, oh, Lorenz, you know, you're just too nice of a guy or he's not getting it or, you know, I appreciate you. I know I take some repetition, you know, I know I can be a little stubborn in my ways because I'm probably a lot better than you think you are.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I promise you, it does mean no good to tell people things like that and to lie. I get nothing. out of it except for more work. If I were to compliment you falsely, I'd just mean my job harder. You're better than you think you are. Whatever that past trauma is, whether it's in the workplace or anywhere else, I know. But generally the best people are the ones that are the hardest on themselves and it's usually the jerks that think that they're the most amazing people in the world. It's so weird, but that's the truth. So the reason you can see your flaws so much is because you're looking for them and because you're trying to improve them, whereas an egomaniac and an narcissist is not looking for their flaws, they're looking for how awesome they are and they're working on nothing. So take that into account too. There's a balance for everything, but what I want you to make sure that you're doing every day is, what did I do good today? What was good? What did I move forward or what did I do even though it was hard? What did I do to Help somebody else be better. What did I hold myself back from when I just really want to You know take into account all the things that you did good if it was it was You know spouse related if it was parenting related if it was health related because we can't do all things all the time So you have to take all the things into account Because what you might do is go. Yeah, I dropped a ball at work hard for today But if you had a super dad day, I don't really care what you did at work that day I really don't because it all comes out in the wash But Lorenz is the one at the center of it. You're the nucleus of that world and so you have to count all the winds and You can't just go. I did all these things wrong. I'm not saying don't take stock of the things that should have been better I'm just saying count all the good things every day You'll start to feel better about yourself and not in an egotistical way You'll just recognize your power and you'll be able to let your weakness says have less power over you recognize that they're just human and tomorrow will be a little bit less weak and a little bit more strong.
01:26:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think that's good advice. think that's what I've been working on this year is trying to be lose my confidence less easily when something bad happens when trying to.
01:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is, I know you're saying it's the last thing, but this is where your tracking is going to help you. Okay, so looking at all of your stats and having them in a spreadsheet where you can look at your monthly's, but then your average is, and you're just looking for incremental improvements. So when you go have a bad month, you go back and look at your average and go, but it only knocks my average down a little bit. So maybe the disparity between the two months are super huge. The average is going to come out and so you're going to go, you know what, bad month, shake it off, month we're on fire because we're due for it.
01:26:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's how it's going to work. I see. Now that's good. I'm glad you. but the formula's in there. going keep them going for the, you know, every month now.
01:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and that we want to track attorney fees too. So I'm going to see if there's an easy way to do that through the reporting and if not, we're going to create a spreadsheet and take Michelle's stuff and just start tracking that and whatever reports Mark gives you and we'll make our own spreadsheet and tracker because that is actually going to help you too because you'll keep it in a track of that anyways and that's good. All right, well you have a great amazing week and I will talk to you

So maybe that's a good time. Maybe. I'm happy to be fearless, fearless children. Um, Patrick, I just realized, so I went to go see because I saw your message, the email that you sent me, which was great. And then I went to see if you had replied to my notes, and I realized they're still in draft because I never clicked send. apologize for that. But you were, you were on top of things. So, um, first of all, thank you guys for rescheduling. Um, on the fly, I appreciate it. And let me go over here. So let's start with this. Um, first of all, anybody got any When's the report anything that's just going good and you want to talk about and share into the table?
00:03:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, that would be a good week last week got, you know, uh, a $250,000 settlement, so that was good.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. like that.
00:03:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Team was pretty excited. Um, So that I mean, a lot of people were sick last week, so I mean, the win is that I would have survived that, I think.
00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. Patrick had a win last week and that was that while he was on vacation.
00:03:42 - Patrick Shahverdian
He came back and everybody had been handling business, huh? Yeah, it's very important. The team, the team has to carry us and one of us is down, you know.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm really important. How about you for last week?
00:03:58 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, we got subbed out and then We got the client back, so Okay, tell me about that Well, he was just upset like Very needy of communication, which we've been good at it's just one of those like having a bad day Didn't get a response when he texted. like 5 p.m So he was like I'm over it, but I've already sent a demand so the case settled the next morning Wow Yeah, and then he was still like well, I want to continue. just want to do it on my own So I kind of let us sit for little bit and I Told him like we're still gonna collect our fee even if cuz I I started getting the thought that He thinks that if he fires us that, you know, basically we don't get a fee Because he mentioned well, it's in your retainer and I said it's not And then he called back and he's like Well, I mean you guys have done a good job so far other than the little instance or whatever so
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He probably talked to somebody and found out he can't keep that money or something.
00:05:04 - Patrick Shahverdian
don't know what he was thinking, but the problem is there was also a passenger that he convinced to do the same thing, so I was like, oh, without him both back, it's good. It's a 100-case settlement, so.
00:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice job.
00:05:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. So it's a good one.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you feel like was, and I'll ask you the same thing, Lorenz. If you could highlight what the best part about how you handled that case was, what do you think it was?
00:05:46 - Patrick Shahverdian
Like the fact that the team kind of had all of the communication in the file, because, you know, the client says, well, no one's ever been reaching out to me. And this is a case where they weren't going to offer anything because he's. on is excluded on the policy, so like all those things were communicated to him before. So I kind of went over those things when I spoke with him and I think that's when he was like, kind of forgot how the case was when we got it and at the end we got the policy limits, which is like it's the best result you can get. So the fact that it wasn't a case where he was right where we kind of dropped the ball in communication. I think just having all the notes and everything about laid out about all the good things that we did kind of helped get him back because if we did drop the ball in communication then he's right and he didn't a bad job.
00:06:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Good job. I'm going to come back to that and ask you some questions about prioritization. Lorenz, same question to you. What do you feel like you did great to be able to keep that wound on that?
00:07:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
at a $250,000 case? I said, think it was teamwork being able to review the case often, stay on top of little things, client missing appointments, rescheduling right away, and being aware of high value cases, knowing what they are, so that they get reviewed, they get touched at least once a week. And then a few weeks ago, Richard Selco talked to us about doing non-quant fables, little bit better on our cases. So tell a story in our demand. I pushed that pretty hard with all of our. pushed it from that point, I've pushed it pretty hard with my team. And this is one where we had essentially have $59,000. and bills, and we're able to get the full 275 total with 59,000 bills because of the non-quants.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because of the what?
00:08:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I call them non-quants, non-quantifiable, so if they're not medical bills, they're just like how her life has changed as the accident. know, hobbies look different, and she has kids or grandkids and her ability to be able to do that. And in future care, there's a possible traumatic brain injury, then talk about that. quoted some medical studies regarding future care for TBI patients and stuff like that.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oops. So we have just a lot of teamwork. work.
00:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Teamwork and prioritization. So this was the thing I was going to come back to you on this cat and we talked about it last week and Lauren, you and I talked about it, which is now looking at all the things that have to get done each week. There's a standard operating procedure, right? Every case needs to be worked out. There are certain things that have to be done. But when it comes to priority, some cases are worth more than others. Some are have more work to do in them. Every client is important, right? case matters. neglecting any is not an option. But that doesn't mean that we can't sort of triage and prioritize according to what's most valuable. And I'll give you perspective on this. Again, taking into account that at neglect is not optional, not acceptable. So we're not talking about not taking care of somebody because they're not valuable enough. That's not what we're talking about. But like Patrick, we were talking about when you do incentive pay, one of the things that you're talking about is making sure that everybody knows that they're equally valuable and you thinking about using incentive pay to show that. But what I explained to you and I'll tell you, Lauren, I know you know this but just something to think about is that when it comes to how you show up in your job, you're not the same because you've invested in a law degree, you've invested the time in that, you've invested the money in that. on top of that, you have liability on you. You can get sued, they can't get sued. So there is a real priority. station slash kind of ranking in in hierarchy, if you want to call it in kind of in everything in life. Now, abuse of the hierarchy can get us into trouble, right? But not acknowledging it can as well. So at the end of the day, sweet law is a business. And what is the main objective of what your values are, how you treat people inside of that, that's culture, that's important. But at the end of the day, there is no business if it's not profitable. And making sure that we have the ability to pay everybody, pay everybody well, so that, you know, we've got lawyers here, like if there aren't attorneys, we can't help anybody, right? If there aren't good legal assistance, we can't help any of their good case managers, we can't help anybody, or we can't help them best. So, profit matters and just thinking about that. Again, neglect is not not negligible and not optional. So, just ranking, looking at things, how do you and how do your teams think about what has to get done every morning? Who determines priority for their tasks? Do you prioritize your day? Do you get it and you say, okay, here's my plan for the day, and here's why it's going to go down this way.
00:12:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you asking someone specifically or?
00:12:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Either one of So, he punted.
00:13:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
You can go, Laura.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you fun thing. That's what that's called.
00:13:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I actually have a bit of a system. You know, I. But, I don't know, seems like it goes to . Pretty much. By 10 a.m. So I don't know. Much of the system. I have my. I try to start each day by writing down the three priorities for that day. The three things I cannot block out without. Finishing. And then I also have. Every week I start with the 10 most valuable clients, the 10 VIPs. And I try to advance each one of those cases every week. And then. Yeah, I make kind of a plan based around those, those ideas, but honestly, like when we talk about prioritizing, you know, I'd like to prioritize my cases based on value, case value. The problem with that that I found is the, is people that call this twice a day saying they're going to fire us if we don't solve all their problems right away, and it's, you know, it's enough that, you know, I know Mark hates it when he gets subbed out and rightly so, but it, it puts, it's enough pressure that as soon as someone, you know, says those magic words, I'm going to, I'm going to replace you, then the whole day is based around them. You know, we have to solve their problems as quickly as possible so that they don't fire us. And sometimes it's, you know, sometimes it's not a big deal. Sometimes it's just a matter of, you know, holding their hands and whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But sometimes it's, you know, it's like they, we got to track down their car and they have no idea where their car is. So we're having to like doing a bunch of free work to resolve their PD. And, and then like a week later, we find out they're not interested in treatment. were just interested in solving PD, you know, it takes away a lot of time from the valuable clients, I think. So maybe it's just because that happens today and I'm kind of, that's like, that pissed me off today. So that's, that's what it's in front of my brain.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that makes sense. Um, so it could be a matter of who handles what. Inside of your cases, there are certain types of tasks that are best suited for you, right?
00:16:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, for example, you have... Hang on sec. Where... Mike. Mike, that does distributions for you, right? Well, not the only one, but Mike doesn't...
00:16:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
does other things too, but yeah, that's...
00:16:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so, um... And are there certain things in... Okay, so... Not every business is equal. Generally, when somebody is upset, it's like, I want to speak to them. the boss.
00:17:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I want to speak to the manager, head honcho, whatever.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do that because they think that's the way to get the thing resolved and to get the biggest impact. So if we take that into account and really what they want is faster resolution, better service, whatever, it may not always need to be you. What we want to get into and it is going to take a little while to kind of figure this out and it won't be standardized because every customer is different, every case is different. Every day is different. ability or your team's ability to handle conflict varies day by day, hour by hour, according to the things that we're doing. There's a baseline, but we're not always at baseline.
00:17:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sometimes we're up here, sometimes we're down here. Right? Sure.
00:17:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can kind of create a list of scenarios. Not quite like role-playing, but imagine it where like if these things happen, this is who should handle it if available, if this person is not available, then this person and this person, based off of need combined with skill. So not necessarily, so you could frame it, like somebody doesn't need to know, oh hey, you can talk to Lorenz because he's the official attorney on here. But what you could do is say, hey, let me let you talk to Mike because he's the rockstar at handling X. It's the power of the word, not the title that gave the energy and the confidence.
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Mike's rockstar at this thing or Cindy is our rockstar at this thing. She will take care of you. So now it doesn't have to be the attorney, the one that's got the liability, the one that's got all the power because you've empowered your people. people. So if there's certain types of conversations that a person's upset about, I want this or I'm going to get subbed out and you like, my people can handle this. They don't need to know what their role is. They don't know if they need to know if it's a case manager or assistant. don't have to get, and if you're in the habit of identifying and labeling people, you can stop that and just say, this is the person that's going to take care of this for you and they're the best at this. Do you know what I mean? Like it's framing. How do you, do you see any value in that, either one of you and using that to kind of make people feel like they're being taken care of by somebody capable?
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So that would take, that would come from the receptionist, the front desk people.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it can, it depends on where the call's coming from, because you could even triage locally. Let's say they pass it to you. and it shouldn't have been, right? You can say, actually, hold on a second, I'm going to give you two so and so because this is the rock star that handles this. So everybody on your team can be empowered to place the call where it would be best served according to the current needs of the day based on the cases and based on the tasks that need to happen. So whoever is most inclined to have the wait on the call on the phone for insurance companies doing monotonous minuteness, that type of thing, you know, if that's that person can handle what they can handle where ends you can handle a certain other things. I'm talking about when it comes to fires, if you don't have to be the one to put it out or whoever got the call isn't the best one for it, then you can Use your own kind of bone tree type system and direct things where they ought to go for that time, that day, those needs. Does that make sense at all?
00:21:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, I think so.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You would have to come up with some examples, right? Some types of calls, types of scenarios and some types of things on the team. So this could be an exercise that we could go through. And again, this will take a little while, because we're trying to build a framework here and kind of look at things, but you could come up with scenarios of this is the type of fire, right? This is the person calling. I'm going to sub out. And here's the sub out reasons, like, and look by you already have sub out reasons. What are the top five sub out reasons that you have?
00:21:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Either you know I'm going to, well, I don't know for sure, but I'm going to guess the first one is lack of communication.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is that? If somebody changed the password on letify for me again. Well, let me turn that different browser. We use a shared letify account with Isaac and. No time to get to help me. Okay, let me go to. Trying to figure out what should be the best report. going to go and see if it drops and subouts by team, by case, by type. This is not giving me what I want. I want to report what's about reasons, let me shoot off an email, I want report report I I want want want want want to what want want want report want Okay. Sorry, but I really want to see that. What would you say? Sorry, Lawrence.
00:24:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What you thought the reasons would be? I thought number one of the lack of communication.
00:24:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how often do you feel like that's a reasonable thing? Like some people are going to say that they've been getting messages throughout the day or throughout the week. Let's say lack of communication, reasonable and lack of communication, unreasonable or unrealistic.
00:24:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
you is like a guesstimate, but I would say probably 80%. I know this is probably, I'm probably off, but that's what I would guess in.
00:25:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think, Pat, for your team?
00:25:29 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, 80,% unrealistic.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so could you kind of ballpark what you think these people are wanting versus what is realistic in terms of. First of have got a ton, like there's not a lot of data, but I'll park this.
00:25:49 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean, if you look at it from the client's perspective, right, like they send a text, they expect to be texted back right away. You don't think that we have, I mean, like for example, I don't know, 300 cases, right? It's not that we're ignoring your message that there's a list of people I need to get back to. If we've been talking all day long, and I've got to now put some time into this climb, because it's not fair for them not to get a response all day, and I stop responding to you until the next day. It's like, well, you guys don't really respond. And you can't really say, have 198 other clients that I need to get to, then they're like, well, my case is not that important. I'm still trying to figure out how to kind of raise those communications with them.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to you, do you think you and Lorenzo are asking both of you, if we had an auto reply that says your message has been received, will respond within X hours, or business hours? Has that ever been tested? We do have Lead Flowey where we have a phone automation system, and it's only for intake, I think, but there is a possibility that if there's a possibility we could set up an automation for that, so that it would auto reply to all messages, and then there's just this communication, hey, we've seen it. It also kind of conditions them every time, 100% we've seen it, somebody's going to respond, the timer has set, right? This is when we will respond within this amount of time. Just because generally most offenses come because of a failure to meet expectations, and if there is no expectation set, or if the expectation hasn't been re, that word, tip of the time. So, like, for example, maybe when the person starts up the case, okay, if you send us a text message, we will respond within x amount of time. You can count on that. Is that a part of your process at all?
00:28:17 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, because I can't. I don't know what's going to happen throughout the day. one of the problems when I started getting assistance is I was always the one that was talking to clients and I didn't have that many cases. So, I would get back to people like right away. And then as the cases grew, those same clients would, you know, kind of feel like communication dropboards, just a matter of, you know, we got more cases. So, I feel like if you start off really good with the client, like responding right away, taking every single call, it kind of hurt you a little bit on the days where you're not able to, because then it's kind of like they're not used to it. But for the most. Part of clients are pretty understanding like rarely will they send like two following types with like question marks if you don't respond with them like 15 minutes or something.
00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good trigger. Multiple question marks.
00:29:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, hold on a second.
00:29:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just think about that because that's something that we might be able to scrape and text and kind of figure out. Let's see. Maybe there's so there could be maybe two types of things that we could include in automation would be like an if this the not. If they've mentioned summing out, then we trigger, we select that in their case. And so then we triggered that respond to all messages in X amount of time thing. And then it could also trigger an automation that every time they message, hey, we've got it. We're going to respond in X amount of time. So that we were not handling all the cases that way and setting a precedent of we're going to respond to you urgently take all the calls. But as soon as we receive a signal, the very first time and multiple question marks is a good signal, right? Most people don't do that unless they're what? Yeah. That's like the one you better call like in the. Or question mark plus an exclamation point. They're not happy, right? So we could do that and that would allow us to triage again, right? According to we're potentially going to lose this case or we're dropping the ball in service or they have unrealistic expectations. But even if they have unrealistic expectations, we've paid for that lead. We've paid for the work that's processed it. So now we're in the hole right now. We need to recover that, which means even if they're unreasonable, we still need to apply everything that we can to say that case. So, whatever those signals are, and this is until we can get with an automation, you know, you can train your teams. If somebody sends you multiple question marks or a question mark exclamation point or threatens sub out, we need to be able to identify them as we need to, like, save the case, right? Then we have to figure out what's the system that's allowed for saving the case. Now, mark isn't going to tolerate abuse of you, so that's non-negotiable, right? They can't treat you badly. You can go, bye. But within that space, you know, what do we do? And also, how often does that really happen? So if it's not happening all the time, it's not a burden that we have to kind of kick-glove some people, if that makes sense, right? How often would you say that this happens on your team throughout the week, each of you?
00:32:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
like threatening to set up.
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah or just super annoyed that they're not getting fast enough to communicate.
00:32:08 - Patrick Shahverdian
Maybe like a couple times a month for my team.
00:32:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that's not high volume at all. Right so then if you have a process for handling it and there's almost like this psychological thing that's happened when you've marked the case as basically it's pain in the but that's not the technical term for it right? Then everybody knows and it almost kind of probably gives you a little permission to be like okay let's just we're gonna deal with this. This is our you know few a month that we have to deal with. This isn't everybody and we've got a process for massaging this the best that we can and working this system and we're not going to drop the ball and everybody else is going to be caught. I'm normal and you know we just get through it, but like there's like this All right, know who you are. know what this is. We're gonna handle it So it gives you a little bit less stress and pressure because everybody has seen Um, that this is a threatened to sub out whatever like it's the case has been marked. What you guys think about that?
00:33:21 - Patrick Shahverdian
That would help.
00:33:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I know we have like a client demeanor tab Yeah, this one I was going to say we use that client demeanor tab I like that.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but if we could have a very specific And this would be good for my reporting too um Almost like a precursor to sub out was like from what point did we get the signal to the the point that they actually subbed out if they subbed out and And of how many cases that we got the signal did we save it? We don't track that data. I'd love to know that like you, you saved the case. How many times do we save a case that was on the chopping block? I want, I want you guys to get credit for that. I want you to see, you know, be able to track what you're doing well. So, let me write this down too. So, many times do you think that you get people like that?
00:34:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm to say that. Well, it's hard to say because we have repeat offenders like right now I'm dealing with one that her and her husband are tag teaming us. know, they're calling about what you're yesterday, every single day, and we tell them the same thing every single day, it's going to take a minute. We go shooting your lean of the hospital. It's not instantaneous. know, in the next day, sure enough, ten o'clock in the morning, we get a phone call from her and get an ear full. And then, you know, we tell her the same thing. And then her husband calls up two or three in the afternoon telling us, you know, we're not going fast enough. And, you know, if they're not negotiating it with us, unless we don't have the right kind of weight or whatever. And so, in their Spanish speakers too, so they don't know about you Patrick, but with my Spanish speakers, they always feel like there's always that feeling that we're trying to put one in over on them, or trying to take advantage of the language barrier. And so there's a lot of, we have to do a lot of hand holding to tell them, you know, We're doing the best we can. We have your best interest at heart. We don't get paid until you get paid. There's no sense in us trying to drag this out. But it's a lot of like having to repeat that over and over and over.
00:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you made a good delineation between cases and incidents that you have to deal with throughout the day.
00:36:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. And I'd say I have probably little bit more than Patrick in that sense. I probably have. Well, I have that one that's taking, you know, until it's resolved, it's going to be every day. have a sense that it's just going to be an everyday thing. But then I've got a couple of other ones they'll call once or twice a week. Just getting impatient, generally getting impatient. know, there's plenty of communication, obviously. But they're just getting impatient. They just won their money yesterday and, you know, they're getting future. picked out of their apartments. It's our fault because we're not going fast enough. We have all these things. as soon as the case manager is busy and can't say their call, then they're like, oh, going to find an attorney who takes my calls. And it's like, well, we spoke to you three days ago. I mean, we're not trying to drag this out.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. So what have you noticed any type of thing that pieces or pacifies people like that?
00:37:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I mean, like, it puts lot of pressure on the team when they do that. But I also understand their point of view is they're taking things out of the apartment. their apartment or losing their living conditions or whatever, then they're like a drowning person trying to grab at everything they see to stay afloat and we might be collateral damage. The things that appease them is showing them that we're doing everything we can, explaining to them like what the process is, what we're waiting on, that we're not just sitting on their case and putting on the back burner. That's the issue of these then, but then the next crisis happens and Patrick seems to be better at. My thing is like get to them before they can get to us.
00:38:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's actually what I was just about to bring up.
00:38:53 - Patrick Shahverdian
So how do you do that? Yeah, like I had one like that, Paula Bo, she actually subbed out, we got her back. It was another like 100 case um and I like she would like text like every other day I like 10 a.m. like any update she's like a degenerate gambler like she told us like I want money I want to like gamble all this stuff so every morning I would come in I would check if she hasn't texted us I would just text her hey Paula's Patrick just you know just wanted to let you know we're still waiting on the Medicare uh and that would help her like one I already responded to her that day so she doesn't think like they're ignoring me and to let her know like hey every day I come and I'm thinking about your case yes so the Medicare leaves not gonna come for like another two weeks yes and that was one where we just had the whole team like even Cynthia like hey this lady uh we just had to like take it head on until it closed um but sometimes you have to do um but that was the one thing where I was like if I text her before she texts me well
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's not going to be mad that I didn't reach out to her and to I already gave her information for that day Perfect so Lorenz what that that's exactly what I was going to suggest However, I would rather it if possible not be you guys. I really want to Kind of compartmentalize the tasks If it needs to be you if that's the highest value thing that you could be doing that day great If not, I feel like those are things that could be Systematized and those could be things that your assistants do potentially case managers and we work that out So again, if you've received signal of I'm not getting communicated with enough or quickly enough They automatically get marked So some kind of categorization which we can create if it doesn't exist so that it's easily sortable and identifiable So pat you've got a hundred open cases Lorenz you have 180 open cases right now So, you know That's a lot to scan through, so you really, if we have a specific categorization for unhappy with communication speed or whatever we want to call it, right, then those people will go to the morning list, whoever's logging in first thing in the morning, sending out an update on whatever it is. Now that update could be potentially scheduled at the end of the workday unless you want to wait until first thing in the morning in case there are updates that come in overnight or whatever, and you can figure out what that is because you can use email automations to schedule it for first thing in the morning, but it is done at the end of the day, and if it would be better to wait until morning than just have them do that in the morning, and they're going to tick the boxes. Hi, so and so, we just wanted to let you know, here's the current status of the case, nothing has changed since yesterday, here's what we're going to do today to push our case forward. Follow up with someone, so do this, do whatever. You don't want to lie and maybe the follow up could be also just another thing that you just have your assistance to, go down the mark and it could be email follow up phone call follow up or you can say when let's say it's the insurance company and state farm say you know they have X amount of days to get this done calling them makes zero different so on that day if we haven't heard from them first thing in the morning we're gonna call them and do this so basically just setting really clear expectations of this is everything that can be done up to this point and we've done it this is the next thing that can be done here's the window for when it can be done this is when we're gonna get it done that type of thing so there are gonna be people that are gonna be happy unhappy no matter what you do right most of them just I just want to feel like you didn't forget me and you're doing everything you can. So, if your message tells them I didn't forget you, I'm doing everything I can, but showing them how, Some of that is probably going to get a swage, what do you think, Lawrence?
00:43:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like the idea of making a list for each team and making, I'm thinking of making the case manager kind of responsible to go through their respective lists and kind of get it, sending each client an update every, maybe every couple days or something like that.
00:43:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that idea for being the case manager, especially just because that title, you can even say like, I'm the case manager. You're the attorney, but manager just kind of has a, has a feeling of I'm getting it done and taking care of you know what I mean? And it's all perception and we'll find out how people respond. on the net, there's always going to be some nuance to it. But Pat, how do you feel about that having, so would that be Elsie for you? And do you think that she could handle most of that? if you just have a system for tagging people as they need a daily update right now because they're not feeling like they're getting communicated with enough that you could write down these are the things that you need to tell her and you need to tell her whoever they are, right, whoever gets tagged this way by X time every day. Do you think that that could be something you could do? Like me personally do it or have? Well, no, delegate. Do you think that you could delegate and it be handled well?
00:44:50 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean we kind of have a system now like on Slack because we don't have that many climbs to like make
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of official list of like checking when it's like that those two last we just popped up because on that right now we don't have any other ones but so the thing about not having a very specific system is once you start scaling up and getting more clients it's too easy for things to fall through the cracks and to for when you're not in the habit of doing something forgetting oh this is what we could do to make sure that this doesn't become a problem so proactive versus reactive um you're not there yet but i would recommend thinking about it and you Lorentz as well and maybe that you create an internal channel specifically for that instead of using littify i'd rather you use littify um and we tag them that way but you can reiterate through slack and have um whoever you're kidding managers are report to you. This was my list for the day of these people or there's nobody on this list today. But basically there are certain things, so we were talking about priorities. One of the priorities is don't get subbed out. What do we do to not get subbed out? If people are upset because we're not communicating quickly enough, that's an issue. So this is a tiny little system, tiny hinges swing, big doors to make sure that we're mitigating the risk of getting subbed out as much as possible. And if you don't have it a specific process with a specific owner that is getting just scanned every day, oh, nobody there. Okay, Then when it does become something, because you know how things go, it could be nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody. Now we've got five pennies to ask who are really unhappy and want you to communicate. They've all got to be checked up on the same time and then nobody. Nobody, nobody for a while. It's not always just, you know, there's one every week, that type of thing, right?
00:47:05 - Patrick Shahverdian
Mm-hmm.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, thoughts, Lorenz?
00:47:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, I agree. I think I started doing that, kind of an intervention of that last week as getting frustrated with one of my clients who kept calling me every week to see where their money was. so I drafted an email with a timeline of the next steps and what I was going to have next. I don't hear from her in about eight days, so.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty awesome. And what you could do if it's that type of thing, and you're, you know, now we're talking about, it's going to be weeks or several days in between things, then maybe it's a once a week type thing. Maybe it's a Monday, Friday, So little things, little processes, little systems. that you could just follow to, um, help with prioritization, help with kind of triaging things. All right, um, let me go back into my notes and just like, um, when I think I'm going to start doing is talking with Mark so that um, I can get him just kind of some input because, and I picked on him a little bit about this today, is that, you know, he's not in the office a lot. There's not a lot of just overall, overall. or site. And we're working on, not that there should be like micromanaging or anything, in terms of all being on the same page and taking the best practices, and benefiting from his expertise, having, you know, doing this particular business model for a while, every office is different. And then,-lipped firms, and then pre-lipped firms that actually have integrity, that kind of thing. So one of the things he was saying is that sometimes, and he said, he's guilty of it too, is that we can be blinded by the limitations of teams. And he pointed out, Elsie, for example, said that she's relatively competent, but extremely slow. What's your take on that path?
00:49:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
She said, he said that her or she said about herself.
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pieces that about her.
00:50:02 - Patrick Shahverdian
Um.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Certainly this doesn't go out of this meeting.
00:50:09 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah. Um. I mean, so far it's been like pretty good. Like. Lately, I'll just kind of go through the file and give her like. Heads up on, Hey, you know, we got to get this done and get that done. And it gets done. Um. I'm not exactly sure like what speedmark wants things to go at.
00:50:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He might be wrong.
00:50:33 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah.
00:50:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He might be wrong. He might be working from past data. So. That would be something I'd want to. I'd want to correct you. And he was saying Cynthia needs to better stay in her lane. And not take everything literally said he had a group conversation about what goes into a file when we get fired. He said everything but demands and our retainer. She didn't understand that meant everything but. and needed to have it broke down exactly. and that could be maybe that she's the type of person that takes things very literally or does not take things very literally. They're different. You talk it to a nor divergent person versus neurotypical. There could be some real communication issues there. Doesn't necessarily mean one is right, one is wrong. It just means that when we're communicating, we need to be on the same page. So, Mark's perspective is not necessarily the correct one now. I don't know when the last time he watched either one of them work to have that kind of information or get that kind of feedback. We've been on your team for a few months. What is your take on LC in terms of competency and speed?
00:51:53 - Patrick Shahverdian
I mean, I like the way that she works. Like I said, for the pace that I think is helping the team. Mark wants to, like, ramp things up and us to go faster than that'll be new for me, too, because I'm kind of just, I feel things out and if I don't really get any bad feedback, then I'm like, okay, we're going at a good rate, right? But if he tells me things are too slow, then maybe I'll start thinking that she's working slow. then for Cynthia, I mean, sometimes I'm too, like, Mark will be like, hey, like, do this, like, if I've never done it before, like, it's kind of like very general instructions. And I'm like, sometimes I'll ask Mary, like, is this exactly what he wants? Or sometimes I'll like, just have him dumb it down for me. But you just got to tell me one time, right? And then after that, I know how to do it. But I feel like if you've been doing something for so many years, and sometimes you give really general instructions to somebody, do you think that they know? Like, I did it to a client today, like, I kind of told her how like, Finders compromise thing works and she was like I'm really confused and I look back at my email And it was like the most basic breakdown, which is my fault because I'm like I've been doing this for so long now And I'm like she probably understands what I'm saying, but she's never dealt with anything like probably So I went and like gave her more detail but Yeah, Cynthia you got to really like do this this and this um Which I'm okay with doing but if you like having a bad day or don't feel like Breaking it all down and it can seem like the person's incompetent So Lorenz Had talked about that serenc Cynthia likes Systems and processes and she was starting to document things that right Lorenz Yeah, yeah so Is there a way to tap into that
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, for example, if she gets an assignment, you know, say, okay, if you were going to write this down and document this as a process, what would you need to know? What do you not know to make sure that there's that you're absolutely clear? One thing that everybody needs to do, um, and I have to do this with Mark a lot, wait, what are you talking about? I need you to elaborate, you know, um, I had another client that he actually referred to me and, uh, we did that today, like half the conversation sometimes is had in our heads when you've been doing it over and over again, the story, the picture, the full visual exists in you because of your experience, because of your perspective. And it can happen with, you know, whoever you're subordinate to, whoever are subordinate to you, peers, doesn't matter. but asking and getting in the habit of asking, are you clear? Is anything confusing? Do you feel like you understand every part that needs to happen and if not, what questions do you have? So then the onus is on them to, do they have a full visual in their head? Do they feel confident that they can do it? And when something comes up, ask about it. But there are so many things to take into account when it comes to your people. Does it just show up on time? Is she loyal, seem to be loyal? Does she care about her work?
00:55:37 - Patrick Shahverdian
More than the average person would.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does she just have an overall kind of good attitude? Okay, integrity. So a lot of those things are internal compass type elements. They're internal values. can't train those. have them or they don't. They get refined over time. know, we improve and we involve. Skill is a different thing. And from what I've heard from Lauren, she and you, she is trainable even if her pace is slow. She's like a kind of slow but steady person, right? And that's the conversation I have with Mark too. And I think that we have to, we put in perspective is that there are certain types of values that also you can't just go hire anybody. Like we are always got, um, I'm really having tip of the telling guys today. Being job job, like looking for what do you call them job postings? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Anyway, we always have people out there, um, looking, looking, but we can't just hire anybody anytime. It takes a long time. Lorenzo took so long to find you, and Patrick, you too. So looking at what people do and what they can do has to be something that we take into account. So basically, imagine that everybody that you work with is either we're going to test your marble knowledge, Tony Stark or Pox.
00:57:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Lorenz.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:57:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You with me?
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you. They both have suits, right? OK, but they both have different skills and different functions. And the suits are custom tailored to their strengths and probably also their weaknesses and also their needs. What makes them special is who they are, but then it gets improved by the suit that we built. So the suit needs to be what they needed to be to support them. So it. can be systems and processes and here's the other thing I really want you to think about is mental lag time. Simple systems can reduce mental lag time so think about it being like two o'clock in the afternoon. Everybody's brains are just kind of statistically that's like the slowest time across the world for everybody mentally around two o'clock in the afternoon. So if you're sitting there trying to figure out what do I do and I've got this whole list of cases, if there is a system for prioritization and it isn't something I have to go through mentally but it's something that I get to go through categorically because we have a tagging system that automatically puts the most important things in a particular category. When my brain is tired I can just go look at that category and So that needs to be handled first, right? That's a little simple system. Another thing could be a checkbox of, hey, not sure what to work on, ask yourself this, ask yourself that, ask yourself this, ask yourself that. Based on those answers, do this, this, or this, which is very ambiguous and probably not helpful. But we can fill in those blanks and we can start to create kind of a framework or an Ironman suit for your people according to where they get bogged down most. So something I would like you guys to start paying attention to and then we got to wrap up. Man time flies. I almost like you guys. Thanks for that. like you. Even though you're hiding your face today, Lorenz, what are our anti-self? I'm now Lorenz. Join the party.
00:59:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, you hit your face last time.
00:59:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do that. I do that. Sometimes I can be anti-social, um, but Gosh thing. lost my train of thought by thinking about it being just uh, how fast it went Um, um, oh so I want would like you guys hyalurin Uh, my bearded guys should I grow up here too?
01:00:20 - Patrick Shahverdian
Who is it?
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Portuguese and me I probably could do it whatever Um, I want you guys to watch your team and You know, you're not watching them obviously over their shoulder will pass tricky. You could be a little bit, but just looking for what kind of bugs them down and You can ask them questions Which actually takes us back to Um Am I kissing my speaker James every as the audio good you guys still hear me? Yeah, okay good. Um, we talked about meeting with teams, Patrick, you and I were talking about just checking in with everybody weekly. Lorenz, we were talking about once a month for you, but Patrick, your team is still kind of new and you're getting some traction. I do like the thought about being consistent weekly, but in that, while you're talking to them, what I would like you to do is think about, oh, I know what it is because I keep opening and closing this and it's messing with my audio. Whatever. Sorry. Awesome. Just each week, you know, anything holding you back and just start taking notes and bring that to our meetings. Anything just feel like it's dragging and so what we're going to be doing is looking for patterns. Is there a certain type of thing that they tend to get bogged down on? Is it a certain type of person? We will learn. Basically, our job is we're looking at everybody going, okay, how do I design the best suit for you so you can be the best person in Sweet Law and also this is what we're doing for each of you here is we're building that for you. How do we make Patrick the best version of Patrick and Lorenz the best version of Lorenz so that we all show up as our best selves and do that best job and that comes, you know, energy, satisfaction, happiness, job fulfillment, all of those things which enrich the quality of human life. It's that giant water. That's awesome. It's good. All right, so what are you guys going to be looking at this week? What bonds are king down? Oh, I can't hear you. Did I mess up my audio? Hold on, hold on, hold on. No, it says iMac. Are you muted?
01:02:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No?
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I can't hear you. You can't hear me.
01:03:02 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can hear both of you.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't hear either one of you. What the heck? Hold on, hold on, on. What did you do that? It switched to Microsoft Teams. That was not this. I did not do that. Sorry. Can you hear me? Can I hear you?
01:03:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I need now.
01:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we can hear you. Yes. Okay. I never had teams on my computer before, but I just became a missionary for my church and they have to do that. And so, anyway, new tech and its mission, everything that. So anyway, what are we working on this week?
01:03:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pagging the high maintenance clients and figuring out what the bog is down.
01:03:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And for right now, until we can come up with a system for automating it internally, like a selection and letify. Just figure out an internal system, a simple system for now that works for you. So, if somebody has, what are those signals? talked about them for potentially subbing us out.
01:04:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
are those signals that we know we're in danger? low summation points or question marks, key keywords like subbing out or other attorney or?
01:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Elsewhere, whatever, any of those things.
01:04:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The word attorney, usually you don't say the word attorney unless you're saying you're going to hire a new attorney or you think your attorney is not doing a good enough job.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so yes, so you're trying to figure out, you know, where does your team get bogged down? What is the bog for them? But you might also notice like what's the speed zone for them? What are they cruised on? That would be awesome to know. I'd love to know that. You don't want to just look for the. we want to look for the good because then maybe that's something that we can take advantage of more right whatever their speedy ad let's get some some more of that potentially not everything can shift around but but let's get some more information about everybody in specifics and then have a way of just ranking those clients where we could potentially get subdoubt as soon as we get the signal that that's a risk that we handle them differently proactively first thing in the morning case managers taking all the boxes here's what we've done here's where we're at here's what's happening next this is the timeline we'll update you tomorrow or later today if we hear anything today we'll update you no later than tomorrow like work at the verbiage but something to that effect yeah yes all right any questions no no no already then well gentlemen have a lovely rest of your week and i was 15 monday

> 00:00:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Good morning.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning, Fuji.
00:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How are you? Good.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I noticed the last second acceptance of the invitations, the calendar invitations.
00:00:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. don't usually accept them. Yeah, didn't. I when I was looking, I was like, I guess I should do this one, but yeah, I don't usually accept them. Is that something that you use to keep track?
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes. And also, I don't expect people to remember things if it's not on their calendars, because, generally, that doesn't happen.
00:00:37 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so you're good about remembering things without them on your calendar. It shows up on my calendar because I have it as auto-populating, but I don't generally accept my invites. But I'll start doing that for us today.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you do. Yeah, that would be great. And that way I know that we're on the same page. And I have disabled the auto accepts because Mark critters and spammers know how to circumvent that on your calendar, like webinars and things like that.
00:01:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, I see. Yeah, I haven't. Oh, that's really interesting.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:01:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
makes sense.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, first question usually at the beginning of the call is just kind of have you contemplated. Now, mostly we just did a download last week, kind of your origin story and things like that. There wasn't really a lot that I would have imparted, but did you have any thoughts, contemplations after we spoke?
00:01:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I, you know, you did, you did ask me kind of to shore up a little bit more of my goals. And I really think after just being mindful, like the sleeping goal would be amazing. And I, I had kind of a thing that I, I was trying to figure out how you would hold me accountable. Um, you have really mentioned it, but I was thinking of ways that I could start wearing my, you know, haven't worn it out.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
watch like ever but I have one.
00:02:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was thinking I could wear that or I have like this four-plus sleep ring which I stopped using.
00:02:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did actually ask you about that last week.
00:02:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah okay yeah yeah so I was thinking maybe I could start wearing those to sleep and then that would provide pretty much clear data when I'm winding down because I noticed like this whole week I was winding down at like 11 and I you know my goal is to get to bed by 10. So I need to start my wind down about 9.30 shower and everything and yeah that maybe that's the way that you know I could provide data to that you have the same alarm I give.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes yes so first of all it always starts with mindfulness and then knowing your period so like I'm roughly a 90-minute wind down one hour is not an unless I'm exhausted if I'm exhausted I don't need it so knowing what your window is Being mindful of what your window is as the day has gone by, so for example, if I'm out in the sun half an hour to an hour or more, I'm going to need way less. If I've exercised a lot, but it was earlier in the day, because my adrenaline kicks in like that, and so it takes a while for my body to process it and I won't wind down fast enough, then then I'll sleep good. If I've had caffeine later in the day or I have asthma, so if I've had to take my inhaler later in the day, it's going to take more of a wind down period and I may need something like saffron or melatonin, which I hate melatonin, but saffron I have found is really, really helpful. I take a two version of it, one has high levels of saffronol in it and another one does not, but it's like a somo. And I noticed it's still pretty potent, so which has been really great for me. And when I've combined that with ashwagandha, it helps my ADD brain where I don't feel as jumpy from topic to topic throughout the day. So anyway, but that helps with the wind down because the issue is my brain. So now that everybody else's thoughts is not in my brain, my brain can now do the things it wants to do. And I like to kind of meditate and ponder things I'll problem solve or I find myself observing myself from throughout the day, kind of reflecting on what happened, how I showed up, I want to show up, kinds of different things. my brain will do that too. So just recognizing what your window looks like. And I would recommend journaling, do you journal at all?
00:04:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I used to up till college, I'd from age six through. who. Yeah, I college I used to, but I stopped after college.
00:05:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm super resistant to it. I've had to really train myself. Because I tell myself, I'll remember the important things if I just like, Oh, Tina, take a mental note, you've got a good brain. My brain is like, do you know how much you packed into me? So I started writing down, I use an app called day one journal. And you can create multiple types of journals.
00:05:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
like I have one for food. I have one for specific relationships.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have one for sleep. I have one for book ideas that I want to write. I have all kinds of them. I have one for genealogy and family history, one for spiritual thought things like that. And because it's an app and it's cross well, it is actually cross platform. But I have it on all my devices so I can access it from anywhere. So if something pops into my head and I really want to remember or reflect on, I can. And so keeping track of really specific things. So just as something popped out to you today, whoa, a man, I went to sleep really good last night. slept a long time. My sleep rhythm was good. What was I doing? You'll get that feedback from your watch to some degree. I like to check my heart rate kind of throughout the day and notice that. I use an app called Sleep Cycle. And Sleep Cycle does a good job. And I also use an app called Sleep Watch. So the two of them have different things. But what they combine, Sleep Watch for the Apple Watch.
00:06:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
OK.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep Cycle. They do record different data and they have different types of reports. OK. When you share your Apple Health data, it combines different things like how many steps you took that day.
00:06:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you combine it with a leg of food. Good luck because I log all of my food. Is it sleep cycle, the orange color one? Yes. Oh, I have that.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just stopped using it of this.
00:07:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
go. OK. Yes, this is great. Thank you, We're going to get back on this sleep tracking thing.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's so important.
00:07:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I mean, like, it's really. I know.
00:07:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know. I Yeah. I know you know.
00:07:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're a doctor. You know. but yeah, this is, this is what I need. This is great. I'm just so happy. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want, I actually don't want to give you my sleep data because I'm going to be embarrassed. But I think that's what it takes for me to change is I need to, I crave like I was talking about the external feedback from other people and, you know, I think you're going to be like, I don't want to talk to Tina. She's going to tell me. No, I know.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want to impress you.
00:07:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
know, like that's just my most operandi. So I think if I am forced to show you my sleep data, it'll do something. So I'm going to, after this call, I'm going to find my Apple Watch or my War Ring because I don't know where it either is. Yeah, we'll start we'll start tonight.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, can I them down?
00:08:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I love that idea. used to journal like I was a weird kid, man. I used to journal. I did and but yeah, I stopped in college and yeah, so I'll get back to doing journaling.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that. Well, there's no reason you can't do that today. So I'm expecting a full week of sleep data and sleep journal. So obviously, you know, make a Tina version so that's that you feel safe with sharing. But the important things like exercise sunshine, I'm telling you at least 15 minutes of sun is really potent in your rhythm in your in the circadian rhythm, but also in your mood, in your hormone levels. And where you're located, you should be okay. like up here, the Pacific Northwest, the we don't get as much and by the And do you like those rays are different for us? So yeah, but I think you should be.
00:09:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I've also been taking a cold shower every last two, three weeks. I've been trying to do that. It's painful, but I'm going to keep that. I think I noticed like in the morning, the first 30 minutes, I'm just it's not wasted anymore. Like I am a little sharper. I feel better about the day. So I think there is a little something to the cold showers. So I'll keep doing that. Like you said, I'll try to emphasize exercise early in the day. Try to get sunlight and then journal and then sleep tracker. So I think if I could do it, you know what I would say about trying, right?
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, there's going to try to do a do not. There's no try. He doesn't like the word try either. All right. Do you want to take your sleeper?
00:09:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you not? OK, wait. So there are.
00:09:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the other thing is then if you're doing the cold shower, please journal and I like split testing. So pick a day where you don't. Or actually probably maybe a series of days two or three days where you don't cold shower and then just really pay attention To those days and then two or three days where you do and and just really note the difference in your own thoughts in your own words Because once you have your own observation, then it's your own truth and now you have buy-in to the action And once you're bought into it, it doesn't matter what somebody suggests you do You know it either does work for you, or it does not work for you. Okay, that's a lot of that amount of time is good But I would imagine The extremity of it and and the shock to the system. It should be you know, noticeable. Okay, sleep. So that's good I was looking at Okay, so you you told me about all the businesses. So this part is going to take a little while to kind of Wrap head around and figure out where, okay, so what I'm always looking for is the biggest levers in your life and in your business. I'm also looking for the biggest levers inside of the biggest values. So looking inside of the things and the biggest impact and alignment there. So the thing that takes the most time is obviously going to be something that has a big impact on your day. The thing that makes the most money is going to have a big impact. So we'll go through it with that type of priority system in terms of like what we discussed and dig into first because there's a lot of different things and if we tried to touch them all we wouldn't do a really great job at it. I'd rather be thorough on the most impactful things first. So let me go ahead and review this again, okay, so actually let's just look at weakness is a little bit more so that we set some goals. So again, this is I really believe in just a line-upon line kind of effort and I think that if we overwhelm ourselves by trying to go too hard too fast and anything, it's not sustainable. You can only really be conscious of so many types of things throughout the day and the kind of effort that we're looking for is lifetime changes, lifetime behavior or habit changes, not because you want to impress me and because you want to look like a good boy on your pulse, right? You actually want to have these qualities in your life adopted throughout the life because of your own value system and because of what you believe that they will do for you. So we're going so obviously sleep and those sleep behaviors. We talked about several things already that you now have to add into. So journaling tracking, sun sound exercise. That's four things and those are significant. Granted, they don't take up the majority of your day. So are you familiar with the concept of finite willpower?
00:13:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, like as in, all start with the cut of energy or life or vitality and then each time we do an activity, it gets dumped out kind of thing.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it's really, it's really relative to that, but it would be about willpower specifically. Okay. imagine that. think it was Harvard that did a study. You could look it up if you wanted to, but there's also a book that I would really love you to read.
00:13:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's called, wait, do you like to read books? would imagine. I listened to the Spotify version.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could find the audio recording of it. Yeah. Okay. And this audio book might be one that you even like to listen to because they do a really good job at not being boring, but it's It's called The Switch by Chip and Dan Heath, and it says how to make change when change is hard, and I would actually recommend reading the entire book because there are a lot of different stories in it, and the way that they make the correlations of the stories, like how you can apply it, there's nothing wasted. A lot of books are fluff, lot of them are repeat, this book wasn't that, those annoy me, I'm done after the first chapter or two. This one, I would actually really love you to read the whole book, and so one of the studies that they did was, I don't remember what school it was, I feel like it was Harvard, compensator, I don't know, so they put everybody in, they put a large group of people, are you guys going down stairs? Sorry, okay, you, yes, you can spend on $20 for the arcade, but you can spend my money for the rest of the day, too, bye, yeah. We're on vacation. This is the only call I didn't read. schedule. But I just want to mess up our system. So anyway, so they, they put a huge group of people, a huge group, a group of people into a room, and they lined it with wall-of-wall fresh pastries stacked as high as you could see. Just imagine what that smells like, okay? Yeah. The first group of people, I'm gonna get these out of order, doesn't matter, the point will be the same. The first group of people were told to be there for 30 minutes and they couldn't touch anything. And then they were given an impossible math test. Literally impossible. couldn't solve it. Nothing was solvable. And I think after like 30 seconds, most of them gave up. Some of them held out to like two and a half minutes. And then there's another group of people, same thing, but they were allowed to have anything that they wanted to. And they tried for like, it was like, 30 minutes. It was something crazy.
00:16:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They tried so much harder and so much longer.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's another story of, like, talk about a rat, like, drowning. After few minutes, it'll give up. But if you save the rat once, the rat will try to stay alive for like a day and a half. Interesting. that one was hope.
00:16:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The other one was, well, okay.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here's the thing with the willpower. The is that you have a finite amount of willpower. So we use willpower for everything that we have to wrestle ourselves with. So if you have to wrestle yourself to get out of bed, if you have to wrestle yourself to exercise, to not snap at your spouse or person that you're working with or whatever, to eat something you don't want to eat because you know you should, to do something that you don't want to do to make you have to make somebody happy. All of that. That takes finite willpower. So empty cut by the end of the day, right? Here's the situation. And this is how it applied for me. So I was dealing with clients I really didn't like. I literally was making people millions of dollars while going bankrupt as a single mom because I was an employee and it was whatever. And they just thought she doesn't know what she's doing. I did. And I gave them an opportunity. didn't matter. So what I realized is that and they were rude, they were disrespectful out of my boundaries, called me on Sundays, want to be in a work like things I don't deal and how to establish. And so I was using all of my willpower to be polite. Oh, I see. I had nothing left for my children. And the other thing that I learned at around the same time was what you allow continues. the two collided in my brain. And I said, and I realized. is that as long as I kept doing these things, what I wanted, there would never be space for it. Because what we want to do is say, I will change when everything else changes for me to be able to be conducive to it. So when my environment changes, when my financial situation changes, when the babies get bigger, when I have more energy, when I've changed my mind to all these things, right? That's not how it works. So what you have to do is craft your environment as much as you can right now to not be something that causes you to struggle and invokes your willpower. So you don't bring the tempting food into the house. Don't schedule anything past nine o'clock because it will affect your wind down period. Don't schedule anything past seven o'clock so that you have seven to nine to be with family and you don't feel guilty when you get to nine o'clock because you didn't use it for family. And now you need 10 o'clock. to wind down because you don't want to fit in the glevel as a father or a spouse. So you craft and engineer everything to be as systematic as possible knowing that many things will show up and they won't be, and you will have to wrestle them. Which means that you have less rustle for the other things. And the other thing that reduces the rustle, a.k.a. evoking, invoking, I keep saying evoking, invoking willpower and the need for it is making it habitual. If it now becomes a reflexive response, then it is no longer I have to make this decision. If you let the thing be a question mark rather than a period, will I rather than I will, then mentally you still have to struggle a.k.a. needing willpower because you still have to make a decision. If you get in the habit of decision is made, there is not a question of will I do this thing, right? So, it used to be like that for me with church when I have little kids. Will I go to church? And so every Sunday morning when I'm waking up and I'm going through all the things like, am I going? Am I going? And then I realized I just need to say I am going because then I don't have the struggle of the question anymore. And that took me 15 to 20 minutes and it was anxiety. I removed the anxiety completely by simply saying, Tim, there is no question about it.
00:20:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You're going. You made the decision that your value. You are going. Yeah. That's what I did about the cold showers is like three, two, three weeks ago I never started and like, nope, I'm just going to do it even that way when I stay over it someplace else I've been doing it.
00:20:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. So you just applied it now. This is who I am. This is what I do.
00:20:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So then you immediately get to apply the effort to everything else, but you reduced all the effort you had to apply to making the decision. That cupcake one was interesting. Yeah, it's not just about willpower as I spend it, but it's also about, you know, concurring
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
activities, right?
00:21:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have, if I'm having to have willpower exerted for like not eating a donut or whatever that example was, then I have actually less effort or willpower where we want to call it that I'm putting into like a difficult task or my ability to keep trying and a difficult task and failing, like that'll be less. Yes.
00:21:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in hearing your cognitive ability, like when you think about like that, and you love having a strong brain and be able to use it for things and realize that your brain is actually engaged in a wrestling conversation about something that doesn't even matter. Like does the donut really matter that much to your life? Yeah. But it could consume you so much that your ability to solve another problem is diminished by hundreds of percent because it's actively engaged in something else that means nothing. So that was a really great concept. Again, I really would love it for you to read the book. I'm going to put it in my notes episode, but you either agree or disagree. Great. I'm not going to tell you have to do it. Will you read that book?
00:22:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How long is it?
00:22:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go check my audible account.
00:22:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Actually, it's okay. No, I'll do it. I'll commit to that. I just finished another book. So this is perfect timing. I'll put that on. Yeah, I'll find it. I'll commit to that.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will we read or listen to? Yes, listen to switch by chipping down heat. I I don't make a ton of book recommendations. I read, I've read a lot. What I find is that most of them, I'll just tell you what the concepts are because that's usually all they have is like one or two nuggets. But this one, there were several different stories that for you throughout your life as a dad, but also in the realm of leadership and business that you're in. I feel like all of the stories will, you'll have something to glean from each of them that you'll be able to store away. It's one of one the few books that I go to mentally frequently.
00:23:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Okay. That's that's why I'm here is to let's let's try something I wouldn't usually read and yeah let's do it.
00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do it. Awesome.
00:23:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I got my I want to exercise get some sunshine cold shower journal sleep tracker and a wind down routine and then switch got it.
00:23:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We won't add probably a whole lot of other things but just let's talk about this.
00:23:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So let me get back to well I was gonna give you example too like Friday Saturday was my day off right and Friday night I went to I actually did get in bed at about 10 30 my wife fell asleep and then I could not sleep till like 12 30 and then you know by the time I got to sleep we got up at 7 30 and that was you know Saturday was my day at work. Unererupted and I was you know, I was tired delirious, you know, so it was wasted day unfortunately So now I mean, this is this is how big of an impact like if I can get the sleep thing, right? Like Like today, I'm a little bit better rusted, but not great But yeah, I do to see on the days that I feel good and I'm well rested like I get a lot of stuff done and The days like I'm just dragging. I'm just slow. It's just it's willpower to almost stay awake, right? I mean, there's a lot of problems with lack of sleep But in our example this morning, it's like yeah, I just my cup my cup starts half empty And I just don't have the I don't have a life force or will power to Do anything so yeah, I think if I get this right the sleepy thing a lot of other things will fall into place It will and so One of the things that I've learned too and I hate sleeping in the middle of the day I've got too much to do it drives me nuts
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like it's wasteful, but I have learned the power of napping and Depending on how many hours left in the day I want to have of being productive will affect how much of a nap I take so 20 minutes even though it feels frustrating and I don't like the way I wake up. I wake up groggy cuz it's the middle of a sleep cycle I find that After I passed the grogginess and I usually will need some help so it's either going to be sugar can be a natural sugar doesn't need to be a You know table sugar or whatever Or caffeine or both or theanine. I like theanine actually I had to take a while to adjust to it But it's really great for me cognitively without feeling like I'm stimulated And The combination of little theanine with a little capping like starting with like 50 milligrams of each But the pairing them fairly evenly works really well But if I so but then I can't just lay down so I have to lay down. I have to cocoon Listen to binaural beats. I have to make sure that I'm not hungry. don't need to be full But I just need to not be where my body is feeling anything other than comfort and relax I Close my eyes as quickly as possible and I'm not allowed to look at anything even if I don't sleep Yes, that that is the thing Because my brain will be engaged and binaural beats with So I like I have a bose headset. So it's got it blocks out the sound I'm it also puts the pressure on on the head. So like it's a physical stimulation of the skin the body Weighted blanket or just wrapped up in something so you get that whole kind of on your side if you're in a cocoon with the headphones I I propped my head up on on pillows or like I I'll use like six pillows to get the perfect position So that every joint in my body is perfect Perfectly just I like I feel wrapped up in everything. So I've got I've got a pillow between my knees I've got a pillow under my arm.
00:27:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So my shoulder isn't stretching like I'm just oh so I can see by my back It's comfortable. You mean you use the cocoon.
00:27:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see so yeah, so like I don't like Feeling prone and vulnerable.
00:27:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I need it.
00:27:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need that in me My PTSD so fun fact about Tina She watched her dad murder her brother in front of her at a year and a half old Abused from infancy got at 14 has gone through a bunch of stuff like lived in gang violence for a few years as a teenager And then we come a more minute 19 But I've gone through a lot of stuff and My feeling is that it was something I probably would have signed up or spiritually and said Give it all to me. I can handle it. me walk through the fire and then I'll take my brothers and sisters through it So it's not a sob story. It's hard. It's it's it's try traumatizing. I find the physical and mortal experience fascinating, but not debilitating. Although I can, it's very easily that I've almost died of pneumonia four times I've been in the hospital on maximum levels of oxygen lungs about to collapse. Do you because I lived in a humid area? That's all it was. And the doctors are like, we can't do anything. And she's gonna die. was suffocating in the hospital.
00:28:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I remembered feeling good in Arizona. So I said, can you, can you let me go somewhere else?
00:28:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I was off all medications. I was on 14 medications four times daily. And then and only when I lived in Texas. So sorry. I'm currently in Reno in a casino so that the smoke is getting to me. But after being on 14 medications four times daily and then moving to Arizona, I was off all the two and playing sports again. So because I wasn't going to be sports. Yeah, yeah. point is is that Being like that I could feel the fragility of mortality very good. Yeah. Yeah. so the like needing to be cocooned and everything needing to feel that yep yep yep.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
The point is I think like yeah I can lay back and just you know for 20 minutes not open my eyes and look at my phone and think that via what time do you do that before 12?
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No it's not about the time it's about the energy and the mental load and what's about to happen and and how exhausted so I have to be really exhausted to get to sleep quickly. So but on those days where you're spent and you're basically a struggle bus all day long. Yeah. Those are easy you already know.
00:29:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see.
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got Saturday I get it. Okay. Yeah. And you want to cover your eyes too because daylight will be enough so you want a bit of a sleep mask. Yeah. got my sleep mask yep. And then you want to journal and find out what works for you. Is there nap? So I like Barnall. because if I hear music, the patterns change too frequently, and my brain will follow the pattern. So it still keeps me awake. I can't listen to classical music.
00:30:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
can't listen to you. it has to be that because my brain will go, I see a pattern.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it? What's it doing?
00:30:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I actually have my, you know, he's making your hair. I use my phone to do. Yeah, actually on Friday, I did take a nap, but it was at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It was for an hour. And then that's probably why I couldn't sleep till one o'clock.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So on days like that, I would love you to see if Safran does anything for you, you know, my girls don't like melatonin. makes me groggy afterwards, but there are things that you can do. So basically the thing is the system is not going to work perfectly without you doing something and put out But right. So you have to find the things that and then you also have to make decisions. So like caffeine borrows energy from the future, right? You basically have to pay that. There's you have to get the amount of sleep that you have to get. There's no way around it. However, it isn't based on time. It's based on quality. So if we can improve your how deep you sleep, we might be able to shave off an hour of time that you need. Like my sister gets about 20% deep sleep, I get about 81% deep sleep. So our quality of sleep is extremely different. And how rested and energized we feel is, you know, very obvious. So your sleep data will give us that information as well. And we can find out what things affect it. Like maybe if you eat avocado and salmon, maybe you have better sleep, know, higher saturated fats, more certain types of things, less of certain things. I would imagine you eat fairly healthy. Is that right? right? It's no.
00:32:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, no. I do try to get my my greens and fruits and vegetables. I'm pretty really, I'm pretty systematic about how much fruits and vegetables I get every day, but everything else I don't. I'm not really monitoring.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we'll want to pay attention to your macros. I'm like, you want to be if you sleep, sleep needs everything. Yeah. This is the whole machine. And this is the foundation of the machine. If it's not rested, like I like thinking about my health at a cellular level, my supplements are based on cellular health primarily. And all of that has made a big difference. I am always working on microbiome health and things. I don't look like it. my body type and my DNA is not working for me, which is why I have to work so hard for it. But There's just so many different things, and you know, I mean, think about just the, the, the, myelin sheath, I don't know, the cells at the health, like when you look at the, the smoothness of the cell body, how, how its ability to absorb or not, everything about it, that's every organ, every tissue, every, everything. So we want to think about what's going in, what's going out, the sleep, all that. It's all going to work together. So we'll talk about everything. It all takes time. There's so much to download, but then we also need to talk about your operations and what you're doing. So, um, let's, let me go back up here. Um, or follow through leaving money on the table. We'll definitely get to that. Sleep, exhausted, external praise, all of that. Just working together should probably help you with the external phrase to an extent, because I will tell you what's good, but also get in the habit of telling you what you should work on and hold you accountable. But the thing is, and my experience is people that normally get stressed out by being told or confronted with something they're not doing right, that normally have felt guilt and shame with that. Don't feel that with me, and they feel like they can tolerate that feedback and that they actually now want it more because they're getting where they want to go faster, and they enjoy that more than the praise, and then they start to see that the praise is actually getting in their way, distracting them with something superficial that isn't actually serving them.
00:34:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I've never been a guilt or a stress. person when people give me feedback and that's not who I am and yeah external praise is yeah I agree it's short term yeah I mean ultimately what I want is you know I I like I just I like the game of business and I like the game of building and that's what brings me a lot of joys to build things and ultimately like yeah that's always what's I think you know motivating me but yeah definitely in the in the short term it's about I like the external praise and well maybe the way that you look at it is because you like that I think because you like to win and you're competitive is that right I used to be really competitive now I just yeah I guess I'm still I think it's the same side of the same coin like it's a different words maybe but but let's play with this for a second and just think about it let's say that that's what it is yeah but it's winning socially people are happy with you so you're winning socially sure
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you did you cheat when you used to play? No, okay, so integrity and winning matter to you.
00:36:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you went in the right way, right?
00:36:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so if you get praise from your partner because you reported a false report on a goal Did you cheat? Yeah?
00:36:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
so is the praise real?
00:36:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, is the victory real? No, did you actually win? Okay So if we say the praise is only good if I earned it because otherwise I'm actually a loser. I lost I lost Then it's not a it's a halo victory. I don't want that. I want the real victory So it's okay to want the praise but do it because like I want the win For the real praise like I want the win I want the cheering audience and that's okay. mean, where would we be without athletes who want to win? Where would we be without singers who want to perform and want to hear the crowd? like, I don't think it's a bad thing. I think sometimes we tell ourselves that these things are bad because we've got voids of the world telling us really disgusting things, actually, if you think about it, dude was pretty twisted, right?
00:37:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Himself? The way that he labeled everything is that?
00:37:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he was twisted, really, but and the thing is that most psychologists and psychiatrists, in everybody in the psychology community agree with that and yet he's referenced still frequently. So you have to have your own internal value system, that's the biggest thing is.
00:37:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think like the biggest I like in the last maybe five years, I realized like what I always wanted was like a hot like of all my goals, I think having a high net worth is like my primary goal of like in terms of like professionalism. And it was funny because I used to try to hide that that was my, like I used to try to not admit that that was my goal, that my goal was to do good to be very good socially, right? But I realized that even when I attained like my highest social external praise or whatever you call it, like when I was at Stanford, I was the chief, like everyone looked up to me, I had zero network, literally zero network that was actually negative, right? And it was really difficult because all my life, I thought I told myself that, no, I'm not a money hungry person like that. But when I got to that point, and I was 33, and I was like over half a million in debt, I was like, you know, I have all everything I want socially. But what I don't have is a net. worth and I've been trying to hide for so long and delude myself literally that that wasn't my goal that now I'm here and I have all the social love and I was a chief at Stanford and this isn't what I this isn't what absolutely not what I want. I would rather be a nobody and have a ton of net worth than have any like social fame or social like my colleagues looking up to me like I really don't care about that like what I care about is like having a high net worth and it felt so dirty at the time but now I realize that that all along it's still what I want is like yeah high net worth like not I mean I'm not like yeah and that's yeah it felt really bad but now over the last years I'm really like this that's what I want yes it makes me happy to like good and I finally got my first million like I actually a million dollars on paper and I'm good about that and that's what I've always wanted and I don't care about like I realized I just don't care that much about everyone at Stanford being like oh you're the new young guy and you're like you're the best we've seen like that felt good and but when I had that I didn't care about that.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that validated exactly what I said before is that praise actually gets in your way.
00:40:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah and it was just in Hollywood.
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was getting in your way yeah.
00:40:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Literally I think you hit the nail on the head there and I'm just laughing because yeah it was it's just so like I'm so frustrated. Well anyway I'm happy I'm acid but it took me like 35 years. It literally took me 35 years to realize like I wanted something different and I shouldn't I don't feel like I should be ashamed of wanting to have that goal behind it or whenever. Because what does it mean? I'm like a for that. Like I used to say that like in college and I remember like when I used to go to church I used to say this and people were like you're not a good person and they. Yeah. tell me like go watch Scrooge Buck Duck, go read like what is that other truck me like that book about Scrooge, Ebenezer Scrooge and they used to tell me those things like and I'm like has a really goal and so my goal changed you know I think somewhere in high school and college and that's what drove me through my 20s is to get to the top of like the pinnacle of my field which I got to and then I was like yeah so anyway I'm just laughing that yeah it took 35 years to but some people never get out of the crab pop because that's what it is it's crabs pulling each other down like oh don't get too big for your britches don't do like you know don't be a sell out don't do this don't make too much money I got hold of it for every culture every single one and it is the poor keep the poor poor and they think it's the rich that keep them poor but it's not the rich are the ones that offer their jobs giving away the training the information of course there's people who want to keep them poor but it's not
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not everybody with money. It is their own mentality, making themselves feel better about being poor by telling everybody else that should be poor, that that's what makes them good is that they're poor and that being, yeah, I went through the same thing. And most people that go from not having money to having it do and being inside of that world, or they have this cognitive dissonance constantly where they tell themselves they're good, but they still feel bad, you know, and so you at least came to terms with that at 35 and that's not bad. It really isn't actually, it was around that age when I did it too and figured it out. So and the older that I get, the more I'm learning that there's almost a, there's definitely not a steady pace for all people, but there is a fairly predictable pace of evolution in life for people who are doing the work. You can watch there is 10 to 15 years of like being in the wilderness and the wilderness is like just I don't know who I am. I don't know what I want. I don't know where I'm going. I don't know how to do it. And then you come out of it and you're like, oh, I know who I am. I know what I want. I don't want you. I don't want this. I'm not going back into the wilderness. You can't convince me whatever. So, you know, basically it is the dues that have to be paid to live a life in alignment and to know who you are, to be okay with who you are, love and embrace it. Yeah, we just, when we're kids, we think everybody else has it figured out. So we, we assume that all adults have all power, have all knowing are smarter than us, have it all together, do no wrong, because that's the way that, you know, kind of adults represent themselves, at least for most of the generations up till now. think it's a little bit more of open now and kids have a different chance. But then you get there and you realize nobody has it together. Like there's a whole spectrum of adulting, you know? So yeah. Okay. So now I do want to know, so net worth is a goal, but there's a reason behind it. Like it's not the thing. It's not net worth for the sake of net worth. So what does that money and first of all, you say high net worth, like do you have a number in mind of where you want to never be below and what you want to keep working forward?
00:44:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, well, I never want to be. I never want to be less than I'm less than where I am now. Like it took me how long to get to 10 million net worth right now. Because I, that's kind of always just the last like maybe 10 years, I've always known that that was like my goal is to get to like 10 million net worth because I could live off the interest comfortably for the rest of my life. And I think that's the thing that excites me is to have like a net worth that allows me to have time through passive income.
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's freedom because then then you can, if you don't have to earn money, you can do whatever work you want to do for the sake of the work. I don't imagine you're the kind of person that could sit around and just watch TV all day and do nothing and be happy, maybe for a tiny.
00:45:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's why I started July, which is the kind of the second company down. That I work with Mark in like last year at this time I was doing the QME work, which is my primary source. You know, I work 10 days a month and I make 100,000 roughly 100,000 a month and so it gave me. me that time. And yeah, during that time, I was like, well, I don't want to just sit here. I want to do something. And that's when I started July last year. And I love that. But yeah, yeah, I can't. I am never going to, I don't think I'm ever going to stop wanting to build. I like, I like what I like building things. But I, but that is, but my goal is to have a high net worth of like 10 million.
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's so we're not going to say high net worth. We're going to say a net worth of 10 million. We're going to make consistently. And when you say that you're going to know that it's because you're able to live off of investments and can choose to spend your time, however you want to, and always be able to take care of your family because I know that that's important to you.
00:46:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yes, I want to build provide for them.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So whenever you talk about that goal, I really want you to tell the whole story.
00:46:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Don't don't shortcut it.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't don't abbreviate it. There's a lot of time. times, I really get on people for abbreviations. Um, word top power, and when you cut the words off, you cut the power off, okay? So we want to be very specific about what we say, um, and we want to be very intentional about what we say. Also, it's a great filter. So if you tell somebody I'm working for a net worth of $10 million and their face says something, whatever, then, you know, you stand with that person about whether you can tell them the truth, whether you can be yourself, whether they're judging, whatever, and you, you want those signals, you really want those signals. You don't want them to be like, Oh, want to know exactly how people feel about exactly who you are.
00:47:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Does that make sense? I like that.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, you, you want to know the people who are loop warm around you. You, you want to know the people who are cold around you and you want to know the people who cannot get enough. of exactly who you are. Right?
00:48:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm pretty sure you could count Mark Sweet in that he's gonna love you exactly who you are, period, whatever. The wife, but they're only gonna be a handful of people who can take all of you that you'll never have to be filtered, and they'll be like, hell yeah, but they'll also be the one that would like, dude, what are you doing? and call you out, but you need those people too, but there's never going to be lucky if you get five, you're amazingly blessed if you have 10 in your life that you could really show all of your sides to. I wouldn't expect that you'll even five 10 that you can show all of your everything to unfiltered, and they're all in no matter what. So keep that in mind though, because if you filter if you alter and adjust or whatever your community communications to people, then number one, that signal is you feel like you have to, is it because you don't trust them enough or is because they're not worthy? It'll be one or the other or both.
00:49:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's really interesting. What were the two if I don't feel comfortable? If I have to filter, I should see if I'm doing it because what was it?
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
either don't trust them to accept you as you are.
00:49:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah, okay.
00:49:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or they're not worthy and you already know that they're not worthy or they're both. So meaning they could be untested. You might not have tested them and you don't trust them and it's not fair because you didn't give them a chance to see you as you are.
00:49:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I see. Oh my god, so my ex-girlfriend, I was with her for a year and a half and it was right around the Stanford time when I was the chief and I had succeeded socially. And when I was with her, she wanted to put me down. Like she would downplay my successes. And she was one of the people that would, yeah, yeah, it's funny. Like, exactly. Like, I didn't trust her. I stopped, I stopped telling her my goals and like, my ambitions, because exactly what you said, I didn't trust her to accept me as I am. She's my girlfriend. And then finally, I realized what was happening in that relationship for this exactly. I don't think I, I didn't consciously understand what you just said so clearly, which I didn't trust and accept me. But I realized that she, that the only way she was going to get, make herself better was to put me down. But yeah, but in effect, I played into that. And I didn't want to put, I didn't want to show her my goals, because I was afraid that it was going to make her feel like she wasn't high enough. And that could be because maybe they, I didn't think of like, they're not worthy of, you know, them or me. yeah, very, yeah, I mean, part of it, probably that is like she just wasn't a good cheerleader. She wasn't a good friend to begin with.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And here she was as my girlfriend.
00:51:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And when I finally met up with her, it was for that reason.
00:51:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Well, good. Good that you did that though because you chose yourself.
00:51:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh my god. Yeah. She kept pushing me to get married and God.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
now you have Esther and Esther's amazing.
00:51:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, she's amazing.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
00:51:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm so happy. I'm so lucky. I could talk to her about anything and she knows she knows she knows my goals. So that's awesome.
00:51:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love this. Okay, we're going to have so much fun.
00:51:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's going to have so much fun. I love this.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:51:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good. Yes. Okay. don't usually get to talk about. Yeah, I don't get to talk about myself or yeah, really, I don't I don't talk about myself.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
about you. This is all about you.
00:52:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Because look, you were born with gifts.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, humility is wonderful, and it's great. But there's a difference between humility and playing small. To me, humility is being teachable. It's knowing your worth, but not thinking as a human being that we're better than other people, like more deserving of happiness or safety or peace, not believing that other people deserve bad things to happen to them just because they are bad people. Because honestly, you have no idea what's inside their brain. You don't know what they're capable of. Like, we have to be able to be discerning who we're going to keep us around, keep around us, who we're going to do business with, who we're going to let inside our sanctum, things like that. feeling like another person isn't worthy of any kind of basic human rights or happiness or joy or peace. East to you know that kind of thing right but other than that um to to think that we don't deserve everything that we feel like inside of us when we're kids we feel all powerful at the not all kids do unfortunately some kids got beat downs at such yearly age and that they don't know it but we feel like we could be superheroes like I was gonna be the next Supreme Court justice and um but I still feel powerful I could be next to a president and I'm not gonna shrink I don't there's nobody in the world that I'm gonna feel less than um because I know who I am now and I know that I have value with any human being that I speak to but I also know that if you put me in front of a homeless lady and she's filthy and crusty and dirty I'm going to look into her eyes and see a little baby and see a daughter of God and I'm going to feel love for her and I may be taught something by her I could be taught by a two-year-old to me that's humility it's not perfect I'm working on it, but that is the goal, is to value everyone around me, but also to value them so much that I want to show up 100% in my fullest strength, in my fullest power, and bring everything to the world that I have inside of me to bring, and not be ashamed of it and not hold back, and realize that I have recognized that even at five foot two, some people can't stand straight in front of me because they shrink. They feel intimidated by me, and they used to say, you're intimidating. I'm like, no, you're intimidated, but I'm not, because I'm not trying to. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to power over you. I don't want to control you. I don't want to rule you. I don't anything. But I am strong, and I'm powerful, and it's palpable.
00:54:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that's funny to turn around that thing, like women that are powerful, get said, oh, you are intimidating.
00:54:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's a problem with like... Men dating are like women dating like my friends that are women that are powerful the woman like it's what they went through in dating Right, it's the men that are like you are intimidating. It's like no, it's not me. That's intimidating you.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That isn't strong, right?
00:55:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
yeah, it's very interesting. I never put that together, but yeah, that's what they'd say to you. But you would have people.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you they won't use the same words because you're trying to please everybody, right? But they're they could be intimidated by your I'm gonna make so many dollars and well, I'm gonna have a 10 million network, which is not the same, right? Obviously. But, um, you know, and they'll be intimidated by that. And they'll be like, you know, Fuji, come on, you know, money, evil, blah, blah, blah, all these things. It's it's the same type of thing. It might have a different flavor might have a different spin. It might be wearing a different coat and tie.
00:55:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
know what I'm saying?
00:55:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's dressed differently, but it's the same. thing. So know that that you serve the world best by being all of your full power. So the thing about having my fiance calls it FU money. Well, he doesn't filter it. He says the word but I don't. But he's like, you want to have enough money that nobody can have any kind of power over you influence over you that you can live where you want to work where you want to take care of who you want to all of those things. But by doing that back to finite will power and this is a huge correlation. You don't have to make decisions because of your finances that cause you to have to choose between one value and another. Yeah, incredibly important. That's what that power is. It isn't about necessary. I mean, it doesn't matter if you want to have a nice car. first thing Mark told me, I want $10 million in a jet. You know, I'm like, why I like what what does that mean to you? And it's like close to change since then, but yeah, they have, they have. And we I had a little bit to do with that. Um, you know, but, but he's he's the value changed in. I don't want to have a jet just to impress everybody and I want to do what everybody's doing because everybody's doing it. It's still a lot of that, but it's more because I want to have the freedom to fly where I want to fly when I want to fly. I to comfortably take my people with me and give them a good experience.
00:57:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Mark is very much about giving everyone else. He did. He took me and my wife on our first jet last year as a talk about it. mean, it's just, it was just a once in a lifetime thing I got to do because of him. And man, we're never going to forget that.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, right? that's a reason to want a private jet, but not because everybody else had it, which would, and again, words matter, right? And I don't know that he was vulnerable enough. to say in the beginning that it's because I like making people happy. I think he really loves bringing joy to people and it's not the thing that he really just says. So again, I'm not, I don't feel like I'm saying anything to you. Like I just need you to know that both of your privacy is very safe. I'm confident you already know that about Mark, so I know that I'm not building any beans or anything like that. But but my point in like setting the goals and having having the money, it's not having it for the sake of having it. And the thing that you do want to watch out for internally is that the want for more for the sake of more for the sake of more for the sake of more. That is a very common pattern that happens when people acquire wealth is that it's not enough because they don't manage it well. I don't think that's going to be an issue for you. I think that your family. will help you stay grounded. I already think that you are grounded. Your reason for wanting it is to live off of the interest. You didn't say let's start with a net worth of 10 million. You just said I always knew that that was the goal. But you do want to be mindful of the scope creep of wanting more and more and more and that it's never enough. You know, that's the Scrooge kind of thing sitting there counting money. And I've met those people who literally counted their money every day and it destroyed them. And then they had to have a breaking period, a refinement period of, I'll take everything away from you and let's see if you do this again. And a couple of them repeated the pattern again and then lost everything again. of millions gone, got it back, obsessed again, gone again. Growing it back and realizing, okay, now I'm in my 50s and maybe there's something else.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I need to be paying attention to a money. , that's a lot of money.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot of money.
01:00:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I think I hope we get to 10 million while we work together. And I think when I get there, what's going to motivate me is the fun that I get from building. It's a lot of fun. I'm having the most fun of my life right now building this new company. So I can imagine, hopefully, when I get to 10 million, my want to create and to build is going to be what drives me for my next goal, but using the number as kind of like, well, did I do in this venture? Rather than the end point, it's just money is like a tracking system that I could see. Yeah, did my business idea work. And right now, like for July, I'm really proud of Yeah, my idea of what I had for July is working so far, and that's what I think is beautiful is seeing my business work. So yeah, hopefully when we get to 110 million, and I want to go further, it's for that reason rather than to increase the zeros on it.
01:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, because it will let you do more, because there's more work that you want to do requires more resources, more power, more freedom, whatever. Yeah, so okay, I want to go ahead and start wrapping up, and what we have not talked about what's not in your list is family goals, and that's really, really important because family is going to take the majority of your time. I want to know what that looks like for you, and I'd really like you to do one year, five year, 15 year goals, and the reason is, and they're going to change. That's okay. So, but I want you to be as specific as you can for the one-year goals and relatively specific for you can do three slash five just wherever your mind takes you to and then 15 because I want you to think about where you're out when your girls are teenagers. Do you plan on having more children? Yeah, we're having one next week on Tuesday. No, no, I know that. I always say girls. No, do you plan on having more after those two?
01:02:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I would like to, but it's going to be a talk with Esther.
01:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's this pregnancy was harder for her.
01:02:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's 37. So, we think she thinks maybe there's one more go, but we'll see how hard the birth is and everything. Yeah. We'll see.
01:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay.
01:02:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, I would like, I would like four, but I wanted a whole soccer team that pregnancy was very.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. Yeah, we both wanted that. Yeah, yep, yep.
01:02:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, would love to have three, but I'm, you know, grew up.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But too, my sister and I, so that was fine. Yeah. Well, so I wanted to now just kind of roughly to look at the timeline of what we want to think about. But having an idea ahead of time helps us kind of put things into the compartments that they could be thinking about how much time there is, how much freedom you want, and also just kind of off-ramp. Not necessarily an off-ramp, but just there's going to be a period during the teenage years where life is different. And then there's planning for empty nesting and what life is like, can you give me five more minutes? Thank you. So I can focus. So I'm wrapping up. Anyway, we're in a hotel right now, and the girl's just like, oh, where did it go? So the seasons of life, they change a lot. And what you're doing for work. I mean, But at that point, you should, well, honestly, a few years, max, but probably sooner. You could be at the 10,000 where you're just 10,000, 10 million where you're just living off the interest. I imagine that the goals and the things that you want to do are that competitive inside of you, that doesn't go away. The need to build and create and nurture isn't going to go away. So, we need to make sure that it has a container that doesn't leach into the family container, and you need to be very clearly, because the thing is you didn't put any family goals on here, that that family container I need to know is it the first thing. I assume it is, but I don't know, and I'm not going to judge you if it's not, but I do need to know where it falls on your priorities. Is that the thing that you're building first now, or is it the thing that you're building building equally and the other thing is, but there's no such thing as equal, one will rule.
01:05:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely, I don't think family is my top priority. You know, yeah, it's not. I think my mentality hasn't really been to think about like family like a goal. It's always been just to show as much love as I can to Emmy and Esther. But beyond that, I don't really have a goal for family. Yeah, it's not, it's not one of my priorities that I think about. It's really, I think if there was anything close, let's just show Emmy love and support that'll always be there for her and show the same to Esther and give her the, you know, words of affirmation that she needs and which is her love language. I've realized and but yeah, there's no formal. Goals for that so I can't even say it's a priority now Okay, and how do you feel about having a conversation with Esther to come up with some family goals? I love this never never in cross my mind it to think about it like this. Okay. Yeah, literally like the extent is I just want to show love and Yeah, just support If you're doing that for five minutes a day, they're gonna feel different than if you're doing it for an hour day so, you know what I mean and True and whether and and some days they might need five hours and some days they might need five minutes.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Having a conversation about how do you even recognize what is needed and what is wanted? and You know What do you have date nights things like that with Esther and and the things are going to change as the girls get to school age As they get into preteens long before their teenagers their teenagers. Nobody tells you this, but I promise you, they are. Like my oldest started at age six. It was insane. didn't know it was even possible. And the rest of them were around age eight, age nine, where they started getting very strong, well, hormonal, everything. So it's important if you have some family goals to know, like, are the things that we want to have like nighttime routines, morning routines, weekends, things like that. where does your time? Where is it wanted? Because you don't want to find out after the fact that they actually had things in their mind that they wanted from you that wasn't communicated. And then you're thinking or taking care of everything because nobody said anything. And now you're not, but nobody knows how to say anything because their people pleasers like, we just want to make sure that where everything's open on the table, you know, what I love them. And that there's a very specific container for it and that nothing. gets inside of that because I don't think I don't think as much as you said, like family isn't your priority. I'm almost positive that if your business was hurting your family, you would not be okay with it.
01:08:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's true.
01:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So it is a priority. It's just so naturally new that you automatically protect it and you won't let anything hurt it, that you just didn't make it a conscious goal, but it was subconscious.
01:08:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's a reason I stopped doing anesthesia because when you take care of people that are under for surgery, it's very stressful and I run out of the willpower cup when I get home and that's not how I wanted to be. My dad was never like that for me and I love you like that for me. So I want to be happy and present.
01:08:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you do have the goals, they're just ingrained in you. You want to make sure that we document them and that you and and Esther on the same page, and that that way, everything that we build in the business, because the bigger it gets and grows, the more you're going to love it, probably, the more it's going to be something like this, this will be your calling, this will be the thing that you do, this will be another baby, know, probably is another baby for you. And so it's really important that we know how to take care of all the babies and the wife, the one that's going to be there forever when the girls are grown, they're still Esther. So I would like you to work on that. That's your assignment for this week, along with everything else. You got it. Be as thorough as possible. You can't do too much. We can always bring it back, but talk about all the things there. And then we'll keep working on this, and then we'll get into the business stuff more by next week.
01:09:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But all of this foundation work is really important. Oh, the sweet.
01:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, huge. Now I get it. Take notes. Great. Yes. Take notes on the things that pop up and we We'll start our call again with just kind of a reflection period of how the week went. Um, over your sleep stuff and then we'll start and then we'll, we'll cover the family goals because I need to understand, um, where the container is, you know, because you have 24 hours in a day, you can't buy more no matter how much money you have, even if you have a hundred million dollars net worth, um, but the good news is that even if you don't have two pennies to rub together, you still get the same 24 hours.
01:10:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So it's a great equalizer. All right. You need to get to your kids.
01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you so much.
01:10:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Thank you so much.
01:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I really appreciate how you, you, uh, you still talk to me this week.
01:10:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It means a lot and, but I want you with your kids. So thank you so much. Have a great vacation. Thank you.

## Quote 15

> 00:00:00 - Chris Mason
Interested in for him is he he has this he developed this app the software that uses in his gym and it's like in 25 other gyms That That tracks each individual because the the model the model that he runs is called semi-private So it's like one trainer to six trainees and they pay like a hundred bucks a week And so with that model You you can get to a million dollars with only you know a couple hundred members and And so that's so he built this app that it When the trainee is doing their workout like they they see what their workout is on the app they log Their workout and then it You when they hit a PR or there's like celebration what's their universal? tree, celebration kind of thing there, but I'd like to explore a little bit more of that. So that's on my radar for the future and seeing that as selling it as a SaaS to other gyms. And that feels like an opportunity for me to be able to share in that revenue because he he would sell it for a couple hundred bucks a month. So that's on my radar. And then I had a few conversations at the Grow Summit with a couple of gyms, one of the speakers, and those years new relationships I follow up with them over email for back from two. I'm going to meet with one of them. We're emailing back and forth to find a time and he actually has a he works with him and he has an agency and is a gem owner. I don't know his full story. If you saw this guy, he would not look like a gem owner. would look like an alcoholic. He would look like a... but...
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry.
00:02:20 - Chris Mason
So I'm going to have that call with him and we'll just see. No, it's just relationships. and then with with Brian, with Titans, he actually... I'm in the middle of an email exchange with him now because he didn't want to do this live event. He backed out of that and so I just asked him like, is this... or have you reached the limit of the amount of work that you want to be doing? Because that's helpful for me to know. and He said that Okay Don't run your ideas Okay, so I told him I was like, you know, let me know if you reached your your max and I can when I come up with ideas I can run the idea through the filter of is this going to create more work for Brian? he said don't don't run it through that filter Rather run it through the filter of if it's not in Brian's sweet spot Who can he slash we pay to do it My checkbook is still the most valuable tool in my toolbox and they said please keep thinking without filters
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and then filter but still it is definitely much more clear yeah so that was five that was five days ago i i haven't responded then he just sent me an email i have given you that same filter many times he's not as clearly and and and brian and brian's word but which is um so the difference is the thing that he really clarified is his sweet spot um so what we need is for him to define what how he sees that because how i would have defined it and i think this is based off of what you would say is that brian loves talking to the people yeah but he um and this is why he really needs to clarify because live events but but um at his convenience and when he feels like it to me, that's the thing, because if he's not feeling well, if something's going on in his life, or he just doesn't feel like doing it, like, to me, that's his sweet spot, but it's not a dependable sweet spot. So I think that he might not being really knowing himself or paying attention. Because to me, that's the issue. Do you do you like, how do you see that? What would you say is his sweet spot that you can consistently count on?
00:05:34 - Chris Mason
Well, he, earlier in this, you know, he talked about his definition of retirement. So it's like, well, he wants to, if he's going to do something, he said, the live event qualifies under two, my three rules of retirement. It's something I'm good at and it attracts people I want to hang around with. the third issue, it doesn't qualify in the present. It's something I don't like to do. And then he talks about, like, he, I guess he had a
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a really bad taste in his mouth because one of his mastermind events like nobody showed up and he was really you know that but it was during covid and anyway um hit I mean I don't know what his sweet spot is so you added another thing that we need to have qualified quantified which is who does he want to hang around with and does he always want to hang around them or does you know like what are the parameters because you have to think in filters because here's the thing and this is what you should say um in your way he has committed to doing things and not done them every year to the point of things getting canceled. And sometimes we're for health reasons, but not every time. So, how many times have you canceled anything that you committed to?
00:07:16 - Chris Mason
Never.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Whereas I have never done that. So, trying to figure out what your parameters are, I can only guess, because we don't operate the same. And that, you know, some of the old-timers and I will take that as flippant, pass it aggressive. It's not. It's just the truth. And so if, like, you need to know, should I ask you about this? Because you guys have a menu. basically. These are the things we do. Is there anything on this menu that you never want to do? Is there anything on this menu that you really, really would like to do, but potentially may not do? Like, this is what I need to know, because all the things that you've agreed to and not done, you agreed to. You're grown , man, a grain is something and you don't do it. Now the health stuff is completely separate. Yeah. Right. daughter's running was a plan thing. Yeah. You know, just not being in the mood for stuff happens. Now it may be that he's actually really feeling bad and not fully being transparent. That also happens too. But the point is that probably at least 50% of the time Brian over commits and doesn't do something. But that over commitment is not an unreasonable business commitment. So for sure. Or that he wants to speak to it or not, there are limitations significant in the way that he will show up in business. So now you need to ask yourself how much effort do you want to put into a conversation with somebody who is not honest with themselves, much less you?
00:09:20 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I was, I want to walk today and I came back and I was just thinking about, and I didn't have this email from Brian yet, because he sent me an email an hour ago saying, I didn't get a response from you on this, although it didn't require one, but I love your thoughts, smiley face, just wanted to explain myself further. So he wants me to reply, I was thinking about that email I just read to you from a few days ago and just feeling this like, he, I didn't, I don't think I thought this, but like, he may not, I don't. I don't know that I can that's not what I'm wanting to say this is not what I want to say, but I'll say it like I can't count or depend on him for things I'd for like when he says I want to do this live event, and then he he backs out and I guess I'm just thinking I'm ahead of like, I need to there's opportunity there and I started I was like what what are the opportunities with with Brian that that don't require me to have to do it a ton of things and wrangle his schedule and I was like, you know, I've been wanting to do a new experience and on the break through advertising sales page. I started thinking about like what are things that I earn pieces on, and then I had this idea last night, is what kind of got me thinking about. about it. Michael Cinoff has just a ton of like old-school seminars and products and I mean he's probably got hundreds and I was like you know we've got all these TXL members captive like they love Ryan and we never really sell them anything we give them stuff for free and I started thinking about I wonder if we could do a deal with Michael where we're just offering like his digital training things and Brian can talk about the the glory days and and we sell to TXL they get a discount we sell to his list and and there's that connection to the the the OG days I guess yeah so I had that thought last night of You're just trying to think of something that's simple that doesn't require, I mean, I'd love it if Brian would show up to, you know, to do like a live event or something, but it's like, it just doesn't feel like I can bank on that.
00:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you just kind of brain dump and you whatever can rip on it, but look at the opportunities that you're interested in What the thing could be, what the price could be, what the revenue could be if we get X amount of people in it based off of experience, right? So some calculations with the potential upsell to something, whether it be into TXL or something else, and then go, okay, this is what it would take to fulfill it. This is what Chris would do. This is what Brian would do. Now, if Brian isn't interested in it, so create the contingency with the plan originally. If Brian isn't interested in, we could do it Chris alone. We could do it Chris plus a guest. We could do it Chris plus, you know, past recordings of Brian. We could do it with Chris plus. It's Brian prepares a video ahead of time just on his own convenience since you guys are making like podcast type content and it could be repurposed into little clips that way, like what are all the things and the partnerships that it's in. Brian's world. So he gets a piece of it. And but also for your own, you are your own man, and you have your own connection and you're developing them on your own merit. So not everything needs to come back to Brian. So when you look at that, let's go, okay, what, what on your own, just do it on your own. And then if there's something you're like, this really, I would only want to do it if I do it with Brian, then then present that. And then start making your decision. But say to him. If you commit to this, I need your agreement that the only reason that you would not do this would be, you know, severe help.
00:14:53 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just I change my mind and I don't feel interested in it. You ought to have the conversation about reliability and potentially over-committing. I think it's time for you to start speaking a little more plainly in terms of accountability. Brian likes to feel good. He needs to feel He wants everybody to like him, wants to, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that. Until it gets in the way of truth, you need clarity, clarity requires truth, and he doesn't do that. Like I said, not necessarily honest with himself, and I don't think it's malicious. I think it's just, I think it's a defense mechanism. I think that other that that emotional discomfort is difficult. And so he kind of dances around things a little bit. And I don't think you're gonna change that in him. And I don't think you want to change that in him. I don't think you want to do that work. So what I think that you do is just really think about his patterns and what what he really does show up well for. And give him a chance to say yes or no, but really look him in the camera eyes and say. Do you think that even if you're having a rough emotional week, you'd still want to show up and do this? Unless like, you know, you're in the hospital and you're having some symptoms or something like that. Like I really need to know. How not just Brian on a great day feels, but Brian on a this week is rough. This month has been. like, do you think that you'd still want to do this? Because if you don't, let's create the contingency right now. And if we get, you know, and depending on what the contingency is, if the contingency is you do it on your own, you just plan and prepare for that. So you're good to go. If the build it with the other person and Brian can come in as an additional bonus. You know, those, anyway, those are just some, some ways to think about it. I do think it's time for you to spend a lot less energy building around Brian.
00:17:45 - Chris Mason
Yeah, that's, I wasn't probably time. It feels like a could pull back from Brian just in terms of like how much time I spent thinking about what to do to grow that business. I remember when I went through that traction book or whichever one talks about the integrator.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rocket fuel?
00:18:21 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Traction Matt had talked about it too, but rocket fuel.
00:18:25 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel. I went through their test and I wasn't quite like a full-blown integrator, but I was definitely not a visionary. One of the things I've appreciated and I've been thinking about this lately just because I haven't had this in a long time, like a really good about like setting a vision of like what do you want. And I've I've felt in me like when I have that Like I can I can go there's fire. There's energy and you're not the only one bringing it Yeah, I think I was thinking like when I was working with Lee like I came up with all the ideas Working with Brian's like and now even in this email. He's asking me to come up with the ideas and It's like man. I Yeah Yeah So But I have really appreciated that about Tim and And it's got me it I was thinking over the weekend Actually on my way back from Chicago is like like really like being In this little team Like because I got to meet everybody that I've only seen and it was the dinner together like it was really cool and fun and this girl Amanda you know she's she's got a couple of like product ideas that she shared with me that she just doesn't know how to bring them to life and we talked about maybe just kind of jamming together once the dust settles from the sun but one of them is targeting the wives of people who are into prepping and I forget it was usually called like it's not this plush prepper or something but basically like why should you give up your free fee girly things so it's like prepper stuff but for for women. And I was like, that's an interesting niche in that market. And so anyway, I mean, right now, my whole thing is just like where my thing I think about is like, what can I do that will bring me revenue. And then I'm just going to do that. And I'm just going to work and keep making my connections with people. We've got the breakthrough advertising bootcamp coming up in October.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask you question. Do you remember, since in a while, what we figured out your effective hourly rate is?
00:21:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, with 10, with 10 is like 70, 75. And, but that was, was doing two hours of work a day, and so I, since we did that, I've just been doing one hour.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. And what about with Brian?
00:22:14 - Chris Mason
Uh, with Brian. I don't think we calculated that.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to, because here's, there's a lot of opportunity around you. And I love that you're realizing that you need to be with higher energy people. Because energy is contagious. And if your energy isn't the thing that's being caught, you're catching other people. Yeah. it can drag you down. And that's really, you've been fighting it. there hasn't been a lot of awareness about that. It was, but it was, it wasn't at the surface. It wasn't in the conscious subconscious way. Yes. But energy is not enough. Earning potential is huge. You're in another situation, though, with Tim as energizing as it is and as good as the team is, where you're not the offer owner and you're not earning anywhere near your potential. So we need to have a minimum effective ROE rate target. And I really think it should be $250 an hour minimum right now, like ASAP. So I think that everything that you do needs to be ran through a filter like that. So there is fun stuff about working with cool people and helping out the amandas care of. So first things first is we've got to improve your earnings per hour. like immediately. Because then you can do the fun stuff. this is the thing. Really, I don't know anybody else that talks about it and I, we talk about it and our stuff and I'm just going to, I think I'm just going to keep harping on this and be teaching everybody. Most of us need to have tiered offers and it isn't just about income but it's also about fulfillment and need. So I have three and they're not even tears. They're more like arms, right? arms. I've got my little Etsy store. It is not profitable. It oozes money. It's a creative outlet but it has compounding power because every time I create the product it can be sold on multiple platforms but it also it's niche. There's kind of LDS phrases, things like that. It's a spiritual thing. I create things that other people haven't. slightly but that slight difference in messaging really can be whether something just really slaps and just hits like yes that's me or not right so it really isn't about profit and that's okay and I'm consciously making that choice and that's just all there is to it but it fulfills in a way nothing else does then there are my high-level people my doctors my attorneys just like you know they're a thousand dollars an hour they're seven and eight bigger businesses they hit differently everything that I do I can spend an hour with them and make their whole years worth of investing in me giving them something to do so there's a few things about that first of all I have to keep my saw super sharp I really have to be thinking on a time I have to have my data organized I really have to have my numbers organized I have to take good notes. I have to, you know what I mean? Like, I have to be on the top of my game. I've been able to not be on the top of my game and still get paid really well and then still be happy. But the more I am on top of it, the happier I feel, the less stressed I feel about having to replace them, the better they do, the more that they go make referrals. So that pays for everything. That's the income generator, but it's also the, you know, keeping me super sharp kind of thing. And because I'm looking to leverage them always and which means smallest teams possible, max profit possible, it gets me staying on top of things. check all the different AIs, all the new types of tools, including in the medical field with HIPAA compliance and all these different types of things. So like I'm playing at high level across the board and I don't do that anywhere else, but that takes a toll on me mentally. and I can only do so much of that. I can't do that more than two hours a day.
00:27:04 - Chris Mason
if I do it two hours day, I'm spent for a while.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's really limited. I can't have a lot of that. Then there's the give back. There's the people. I just want to help all the moms. I want to help the dads too, but especially the moms. the moms are gonna go help the dads. moms are gonna help the brothers. It's like, then they're gonna be taken care of if I take care of the women. 100%. But I want to be able to help them. And that is not a very profitable thing in the offers that I'm thinking about doing because they can't pay as high level. My earnings per hour to start with, like if the number gets bigger, but then I have to hire more people and manage because the more important thing to me is really serving that community very well. So the margins are going to be much smaller. They should still be good, but much smaller. a lot more group effort and but it's a completely different level of fulfillment, a different level of I'm going to say the same things over and over and over and over and over again, which I kind of do anyway, because fundamental concepts, right? But I'm going to say the real big stick things over and over again. And so that doesn't satisfy my big brain efforts, right? The one is like, let me think about all the fun exciting new things, let me learn, let me explore. And on top of that, I'm also serving my mission on top of that, I'm in school for my psychology degree. So, which sounds like a lot and compared to how it's been for the last several years, but I was bored in languishing and I didn't know that. But with those are the compartments. And so when I'm looking at everybody, unless it's, well, even the doctors and attorneys, the entrepreneur visionary ones that reach out to me, they love marketing. They love automations. They love leverage. So I'm working with people who are also, no matter what they're doing, they're not the average type. They have different levels of fulfillment that needs to happen. So all of us need something that has staying power that has the compounding. It's the steady rock, right? So it's got a community. You've got followers. You've got a constant message that really just doesn't change. It's a fundamental message. It's a fundamental thing for you. think it's copy and marketing or maybe even just direct response itself, which is getting people to respond to you based off of what you're doing. But there's also just kind of business. I would really put you more in the marketing realm of what gets excited because of what you go back to most. is offers and serving the the market. So, but you're also interested in business and you're interested in freedom and you're interested in self-providence and you're interested in sustainability and you're interested in people working for their own values not for some arbitrary amount of dollars, not for shiny objects because you want to keep up with the Joneses, right? So, you're the, we talked about this before like average Joe, but the not average, like it's not average. It's think that, so when I'm talking to you about me, to change things. What I think it is is that, and I also know that when we get clearer on what we want, that's when it comes to us, right? Because you can set a really clear attention. Your conversation starts to change who you pay attention to and want to even converse with changes because you've made this switch in your mind and made a decision. This is what I want to attract. So there are two paths that I think that you could consider, and one is, potentially three, one is a consulting gig that is a profit sharing performance-based incentive that is decided from the beginning, so you're not arguing about it. it could be relatively small, feel better not be having a hot flash going on. Okay, then pause is awesome. Anyway, so it isn't about necessarily how big the percentage is, but it's that that there is a growth opportunity, right? Because then the onus is on you is to leverage that. And you can potentially either reinvest some of your earnings into somebody that so you're barely touching it. And that's an engine because it's an engine for you because you brought it because it will keep making money and then you have a person that helps you with it. Like I've been telling you I want you for sure to be using other people's time and talent a little bit more, but first we've got to get you to the money where you can really do that. So that's one version of it. Another one is a you know a profit sharing partnership, but not with somebody old. this is not an ageist thing because some people can be really old and just really just like they're they're still at it there's there's all kind of things but I mean like old in their heart just like right you know like it without fire let's let's put it with that somebody who has fire in them for the stuff that they're doing and maybe they hate marketing but they love their products love the market love but but don't love marketing you know there are lots of those people they're really good at fulfillment and they may be good at marketing but they hate it and they or they also have come to the realization that they're splitting their time doing something that they're not efficient at and can make so much more money so that is the thing I really think that you should be kind of super powering your magnet for yeah Somebody who's very energized very excited and has a profitable product who just realized that They are ready for you know a full-time marketer and can pay a base pay plus performance So your original EHR isn't going to be very high, but your job is to do some really good marketing Research and to see that you're willing to put some skin in the game and go I think that if I put these split tests in if I Created this order bump if I created this continuity program if I Make sure your list hygiene was really good and improved your inbox, but I don't like that's a whole lot of stuff Mm-hmm, but you know, and so it's an investment But that's how you explain to them and justify why you're going to give me this percentage Because there's this is a lot but you really need to make a list of these are all the things I'm doing. This is Each one of these are expert level full time jobs. Do you understand that person like that I'm talking to you? These are all full email, like list manager, full time job, affiliate manager, full time job, marketer, full time job, copywriter, full time job, right? These are expert level things, and you can do all of these things, or you can hire somebody out. So either there's a budget for it, so it's not coming out of you and you make that agreement, to begin with, but either way, I think that that's super leverage, gets you into some exciting stuff, and can keep your EHR around $250 or better. For sure, better would be great. Cause let's do some quick during math. Hold on a second. So if we did, if we had you working at, go away, what is this, these camp? called you base camp. Bye Felicia, hold on, kept you here later. turn 50. I can say, turn 50. the truck times 30 times 4 equals $32,000 a month.
00:36:08 - Chris Mason
River and months, yep.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you worked 30 hours a week at an EHR up to 50. So if you cut that in half, and it was $125, then it's $15,000 a month. Yeah. the thing about that is you could easily have $5,000, $10,000 in paying other people, really great other people in any of those departments, and have them split across multiple partnerships, right? Yeah. Where they're really happy, that's the thing. Where do the numbers look amazing? Where you're not stressed out, where your brain isn't the only one on the things, because that is a huge bottleneck. That's if you get sick. if whatever, so many things, right? So you're leveraging by having multiple other people. If you have a copywriter, but you don't have a marketer, guess what the copywriter is also? They're a marketer, you know what I mean? Marketer, not the copywriter, guess what they are also. know, like there's overlapping skill sets. So in terms of like giving a brain a break, or giving your brain a super boost when you get to talk to those people and they give you an idea and you're like, oh yeah, that's awesome. And it's just part of their job to do that. So this is where I think that you're at, Chris. And if you, I don't know where you're going to find them, but I think that if you just spend a lot of time, we were talking about it in 2020, building your network. I want you to be so much more intentional, intentional. What the crap is with my brain, intentional bowl? That's not where Tina knows that. Anyway. Keeps talking in the third person psycho. Okay. really reaching out and looking for people like that who have amazing products, who are still fired up and excited about their stuff, and who aren't talking about. We're going to 10x this year and blah, blah, and making those really crazy statements about these arbitrary goals that are just about getting attention. You want to see that they're having conversations about life is all about family. At the end of the day, this is what matters. So you want to see value statements from them that show that they have a center and a compass that is not money. You also want to see their language being about appreciating talent and really lifting other people up. Like create the avatar for your ideal partner. What do they look like when they're talking in social media? What kind of emails do they write? What kind of videos do they make?
00:39:02 - Chris Mason
What is their language?
00:39:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you will profile that type of, like Jeremy Weiss, always lifting people up, always about his family, super smart, loves the stuff he does, always enthusiastic. And super connected, he may know some of these people. And another thing that you can do is you can do a tiered commission thing like, hey, man, you got these connections. I'll pay you a referral fee if we do some business. I'll even pay you a long term of referral fee of like 5% of whatever I make. So not whatever the thing makes, but whatever you make or 2% or whatever. So you just be like, I mean, nobody pays me. I make connections all the time and you're going to pay me just to introduce you to people. You know what I mean? Like, play differently, but pay to play so that that everybody gets blessed, um, and it's not about, you know, manipulating or anything like that. It's just showing gratitude in a currency that they can use however they want to.
00:40:13 - Chris Mason
Mm hmm. That's an interesting idea, um, because I'm working with him now on this podcast and you brought him up. was like, yeah, he may know somebody, but I mean, heck, he may also be that somebody I know.
00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like him. I think he's an amazing guy. I think the two of you have a lot of synergy chemistry, like, um, synergy was really the word that I had the chemistry was that for sure too. Yeah. Do you know how God be working? He just like pops things in. Yeah. wasn't an accident that that's the name that popped in my head either.
00:40:53 - Chris Mason
Like there's a lot there.
00:40:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's interesting. That's aspect of it. Like he's not going to meet Chris Mason's, Chris, you're very special. I've told you that lots of times, but your values and your quality, your integrity, people aren't just going to find that. How many people like me have you ever met?
00:41:17 - Chris Mason
I don't know. Not many, if anybody.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Never met Chris Mason before. You know, and I can't say that of everybody. There's a lot of people I'm like, yeah, I know few of you. And they're the people that are idolizing Grant Cardone. What's his face? I want to say Vinny, like my cousin Vinny, but that's not it.
00:41:45 - Chris Mason
What's his, he drinks wine, Gary Vee, Gary Vee.
00:41:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Gary Vee. One of the two of them kind of in the same boat.
00:41:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're not that unique to me. There's, there's, there's other ones of them. And it's the grand grand grind, money, money, let me, motivate you but really my stuff isn't just not together and it's like Gary V looks like like like the emperor on on Star Wars. Brad Cardone's doing a video about hustling and grinding in the hospital when he just had a heart attack and his wife looks like she wants to slap him upside the head.
00:42:23 - Chris Mason
He just had a heart attack?
00:42:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, this was a few years ago.
00:42:26 - Chris Mason
Oh, few years ago.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah, yeah, no, but he was like, you can't stop me. I'm like, you're the poster child for what not to do.
00:42:35 - Chris Mason
Oh, I remember that. Yeah.
00:42:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, my nurses are mad at me and I'm looking at his wife out of the side. And now, but now she's all, you know, she's all big and she's in front of, you know, she's got her own following and everything. And so, of course, she's gonna toe the line and play the role. I'm like, anyway, so you bring in not just like you know all your marketing skills and business skills but you you come with a compass that matches just a very small group of people and especially in your age bracket because it takes a while for people to realize that money is not everything you know so that's one of the reasons a lot of the older people are more drawn because they finally figured it out but there is a generation of people that are like they got it from the beginning they're like oh what no this is crazy anyway so Jeremy Jeremy's connections anybody else that you might find through there build out your avatar and make sure that you have a base pay if there's an existing business and it can be relatively low but that's their skin in the game with you because you're going to put your time in they're 100% going to get a benefit out of it And, you know, you can put your time elsewhere and they can say no, but base pay, minimum of 2,500 whatever a month plus performance incentive. And then your job is to start acquiring the types of people that you would need, whether they be an automations person, which you've already got that infusion soft girl. So you might be able to do some things for you, several things for you.
00:44:24 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Potentially a media buyer, junior copywriter, graphic designer, not top of the line in cost, know, optimized leverage kind of people that don't charge a lot, but then you kind of give them incentive to be like, Hey, that did amazing. Here you go. So they're really happy and they're loyal. But I think that that is a good play for you for a while until you've made enough money that you can start putting in investments and getting your money to make money for you.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, that's So it's like, the thing that I, that I wouldn't want to think about, what is it that I want, is like, well, just want to pile cash away and, and be able to have revenue coming in through from investments. And, and when I think about that, was like, you know, by it, because I really like working. Like, I like singing my teeth into something, into a project. And so, like, if I had that, I don't feel like I would not, it's not like I would just sit around. No, I'm fine.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then you could be a really high level consultant if you wanted to do, or just a profit partner consultant. You know what I mean? Not an operational consultant like you are now. I think you and Seth, and maybe you, Seth and I, should do something together.
00:46:11 - Chris Mason
He... Oh, Seth.
00:46:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Now, the difference is he's not making money, and so it's not, this would be, this would be one of those things that you feel like called to or don't, but what he is working on now is teaching people how to create trust and use trademarks to basically protect yourself against government theft. But given the state of the economy and what we all see the writing on the wall, whatever, you know, I think that there are extremist levels of that, and then I think there's just not preparatory levels of that, but I think that there's a life on all the, you know, the family compass, the liberty compass, the hard-working entrepreneur that I love my nation, but my nation has a lot of issues, compass, you know. So, but he just had a baby, his wife just had a baby. Marketing is not his thing. You could do it in your sleep. He can teach the stuff. He does a lot of research. He has very high-level conversations. And he's got millionaires at the Wazoo that just love him and trust him immediately. There's a lot, if YouTube became good friends and really talked a lot, I think that there's a lot of synergy there as well. And I would love to be part of that.
00:47:57 - Chris Mason
Yeah. I mean, I like Seth. have a really good conversation. with them and I don't think like they're all I'm in them through you and so yeah I mean I'm totally open to that like I for example like one of the things that that I there was a guy at the grocery summit that I didn't get a chance to to speak to but he was talking about this infinite banking concept which I mentioned to you for a long time ago this way to use whole-life insurance and yeah I have and I wanted to meet him and I just it would have felt anyway we didn't get a chance to talk but he was he's teaching that concept for Jim owners and I've always been attracted to that taking that idea working with somebody who's an in that and in setting up those those policies and I mean, you've got to love to hear about that, too. Like, I could get, if you get your insurance license, which is not that hard to get, then you can earn on the contract, the policy contract that somebody does. And so that feels like a really motivating message to me because it's like, man, because I see how it works. And my missing piece has always been like, I'm not the expert to talk about it. I don't have all the credentials behind my name, and I'm not a financial, whatever. So that would be both a good partner for me and a good industry. Yes.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested in you should go back and have that conversation. I'll go back to stuff, too. He almost pretty much doesn't like to work, but that's not it.
00:50:04 - Chris Mason
The work that he does is learning.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's having high level conversations, so it's learner teacher, learner teacher, that's it. But he learns the most high level types of things and he wants to teach. He wants to teach everybody. So buddy marketing operations, so like I would be all ops managing all the teams, making sure the money is taken care of, making sure he stays grounded and doesn't keep, because he will jump around a billion times classic visionary, you know, but you can't take the good of somebody and not take the bad, like we've all got our stuff. So I think if you were willing to, like I would just do some work until it made some money and we'd have the parameters, but I wouldn't be getting paid. My money will have to come elsewhere, but I don't think there'd be a lot of time in it. But what I've watched him do time after time is he makes a post, a millionaire's reached out and want to give him money. So you can't do regular math and regular predictions working with people like that, not working with people like me either, working with people like you. mean, your math has been regular, that's because you've been playing in other people's playgrounds with their rules. But you are, and I've told you this repeatedly, nobody shows up as consistently as you do. You are a rock. You stay on top of your game and you're always helping people, which is two things. One, you just get the benefit of the gifts of but also that good karma, God is out there blessing you in ways you don't even know it. And just helping you through things because You're just always taking care of people. So anyway, I will all set up a three way chat. Probably he likes telegram. Are you on telegram?
00:52:11 - Chris Mason
But I can be.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't what's up. I don't know what's up to you. I think but because it's owned by Facebook and the conversations that we're having on Facebook is super spy. They just are like it was crazy because Dexter had this experience and I'm like, I'm telling you I've been telling you turn off your messenger microphone because he's had profiles of people he was around playing poker with show up and he's never been around those people ever. And I'm like, I like, I promise you it's listening just it's that one app. So because they own what's up and they're talking about end to end encryption, whatever. I'm just, you know, whatever.
00:52:53 - Chris Mason
Okay.
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, if you can do telegram, if you can telegram send me Can I say we'll connect all connect us with Seth and then we can have a conversation about it because again, that's a long place. So you have to control your time limited a little bit. But I don't think it's very difficult because you're part of the conversation to me would be offer creation. You know, and that's just an idea. Then Seth has to actually create the content. And my job is to make sure we're okay, let's create the framework and make sure all the stuff is there. Find the resources whatever manage that type of thing. So it shouldn't be a burden. It's not going to be big and fast, although he's probably going to need something big and fast, but he's good at doing that. Anyway, that's his burden. Our burden is make our money. You have to make your money. We would do this together. So just keep in mind it would be something that you need to compartmentalize. Anytime you do anything like that, that's a passion project. You, you got to keep it limited. No matter how it excited. is somebody else gets, don't feel obligated to do more than is prudent to do. Don't outpace anybody. Don't care about the project more than anybody else does. That's just kind of my rule of thumb. I will not work with anybody who I care about their business more and I show up more consistently than they do. I'm like, I'm going to pull back because that's just a recipe for resentment and failure ultimately. So don't do that. Okay. So just to recap everything for anything with Brian, I think that you should just think about all the things that you would want to do and do dirty level of work would be. And I also think that you should repurpose as much stuff as you possibly can. creating those offers. And can you repackage that people have said no to and offer it to them as like vault access at a lower price so that you're getting money out of people who have never paid you but are on the list who have definitely raised their hand with interest but said no for whatever reason why did they say no was it a price? Can we survey people like what are the actions that you can take to get to to extract more out of the existing assets that maybe you've been neglecting because you do book camps and you do TXL and you do everything else like let's really think about extracting from what we have and leveraging what we have then if it's thinking of stuff to do with Brian um a real conversation with him about how are you going to show up and and what you need and just say okay here's what's on the table in every single one of these scenarios it can be done so i need your full agreement, either one that you will show up on number two, that it is okay if I do it and you are not going to go back on the, well, I don't want you to do it by yourself kind of thing. Okay, so either you're all in and you will do it, or I get to do it, but we are not saying we'll do something and not doing it again. Then get what you have a good conversation with Tim, like really meditate, ponder, pray, however you want to handle it about what's on the table and be willing to walk away if you're not respected fully and honored for a time. Don't be afraid that you won't get more of that. You know you will. You know you will. Talk to Jeremy, just nurture the conversation, find out what his goals are. What does he want to do? what's he not doing that he wants to? What likes him up? Like really get to know him because he spends all of his time talking about everybody else. Talk about him. Like what's going on, Jeremy? Um, and then, uh, see who else is around and see what's on the table and I, and biggest thing is in the back of your mind, always $250 an hour EHR, keep that in your mind and do the math and figure out how can I make this happen? can go down to $125 an hour EHR because we did that math. That's $15,000 a month at 30 hours a week and 30 hours. We know that you'll work that and not be burned out, but we really, really, really want to shoot for that $250 with everything new that comes in unless it's the passion project and you limited to maybe two or three hours a week tops. That's, that's what I think.
00:57:46 - Chris Mason
Okay. Yeah. That's, um, did we record this?
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you send me the recording? Yes. I had the note taker come in, so yes, I will send it to you. Okay. It didn't, it wasn't at the very beginning, but I think when we started getting into it, I realized it and turned it on, so.
00:58:05 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:58:08 - Chris Mason
Thank you, Tina.
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're always welcome. Good to talk to you.
00:58:11 - Chris Mason
And let's see where we are. guess I'll talk to you in a couple of weeks, huh? Yeah, I sent you a text on my telegram.

Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. Kind of quiet.
00:00:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Almost be my hair pods.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're nice and loud now. Okay. Well, I am struggling with energy. I'm super allergic to where I live. And yesterday I had an asthma attack. I wasn't sure I was going to survive. And I'm just kind of sleeping. Yeah, it was pretty scary. But also I've been through stuff like that. But anyway, my brain is just not, well, I don't know, my energy, I think my brain is fine. I just, and I feel tired. So hopefully it'll pick up. I've done all the things. It either will or I won't. But yeah, just letting you know how to time if you're like, what's up?
00:01:21 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm sorry. No worries.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm used to it. Just got to let people know because my energy swings so much because of health. That sometimes people are like, what, like, is it me? Did I do something? So I just got to let them know at a time that I'm like, no, I'm fine. Everything's fine. It just feels different. Not me.
00:01:51 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. Yep. Okay.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited for this. excited to see what you've been doing. I think if we can screen share. I've been praying for it every day for you and also for them so that we know that we can be inspired for them to help us them accomplish their mission and know how to package and put things together. So yeah, anyway, I'll be quiet. Thank you.
00:02:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Same. So we're thriving on the same level there. So can you see the workflow? I'm sharing. Okay, let me point out a couple of things here. They just did this event last week. Okay, they reinvent your self-summit and over five days they traditional summit style where replace available for a while. If you join our $39 month thing, you get all the replays, plus all 80 of my meditations or hypnosis audios.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that for?
00:03:16 - Seth Ellsworth
They sell those on their shop. How much of these on the summit for? It was free.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:03:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I think they had a VIP level. And they only got like 30 people in there. Oh, I have no idea how many people they got in there.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I thought you said okay.
00:03:40 - Seth Ellsworth
I was like, wow, they had a VIP level. And this is because this this thing right here, I'm going to highlight it in yellow. This is their seems to be their new focus is building this community. This is this is on Um, mighty networks, okay, $39 per month. And I imagine, you know, that's, this could be a play that, and John mentioned this on our first call, it's called grow and transform. Um, getting more people into this would be freaking child's play with a proper email. Um, So this could be the guts of what we suggest for them as a focus. Um, So, so that's, that's, that's a potential direction. Now, just to give you a picture of, of their business model, they kind of have two paths or two buckets. And these are absolutely not clear on their website either. Uh, because there's a lot of confusing crime. crossover. But they have the RTT therapy and personal development. And here they give away some regifts. Here's the landing pages to get a therapy partner. So so Marissa does not do therapy calls. She has a team of therapists that are trained. And people book calls just like they would from any therapists. So there's that. This, if I had to guess, is a small percentage of their revenue. Because they're therapists, we don't know because they haven't asked those questions per se, the career, the career path where they become a therapist and are allowed to offer RTT to their, to their clients. That's the 15. This is the $15,000 high ticket thing. think this is probably 95% of their revenue.
00:06:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It based off of experience with other people and smaller models where they do a thing or they teach people or certify them how to do the thing.
00:06:20 - Seth Ellsworth
That's always the case. It's the teaching and certifying, yeah. Right, so this certification, and they do have a certification course, I'm sorry, they have a course and a certification, but it seems to me like they drive most of the traffic to the book a call stuff. So let's see, book a up here. So there's that. We have, they have events. They do these all over the place. They have events for both tracks. One, the track for people that want to experience their own breakthrough and the track for people that want to be practitioners and then they have events as part of their fulfillment. So there's marketing events and then there's fulfillment, fulfillment events. This is, this, their conversion is probably really, really high with this. don't do a lot of marketing events. And I'm sure that that expands a lot of resources and time and they're getting older. So I'm. An educated guess would be they don't want to do more events.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:07:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So an evergreen thing that runs that sells this $39 a month deal to where they don't have to do this is the first time they ever did the reinvent yourself summit that's a brand new thing. I have no idea how it produced. And a lot, I watched probably 10 of those sessions released the replay and most of them were recorded previously, which is a big undertaking, but now they have an asset that they can use. just, my opinion would be, this is incongruent with RTT because it's a bunch of random value that is not going deeper with their unique ability. So Marissa showed up and she did, she was, I think on three of the days, she was the first segment where she led them through a meditation or a sorry, I keep calling a meditation hypnosis, which great, but to me, they're running somebody else's playbook here. which is incongruent with this offer. So what we would do for them, essentially, this would be what I would look at, is I would go to their, let me share a second. I'm sure my browser. Here's a re-event yourself summit. Lander. They had some ballers in here. Jim Wick. John Asiraf, James Altucher, Pace Morvey's huge. He's a $600 million guy. But he's real estate. And then, anyway, this is a very, very random sampling, which I think is good five years ago. I don't think summits convert very well. And I could be wrong, but if I had to guess, I would say this didn't exceed their expectations. Here are landing pages. This is a landing page for free gift that is for somebody who doesn't know what path they want to go on. Here are an example of four gifts that they give away for free. So you click on this and you fill out your name, for each of these. So potentially, we could take one experience from this bucket. This is the this is the heal your self personal development bucket. This is the I am enough meditation. She has a book called I am enough. This could be a big one because that could also support the book. So my questions to them would be which of these produce the most revenue. And then we would take this automation or sorry this hypnosis and automate a four or five day email based experience for this. And also do the same thing for their free gifts. Let me see where that was the free gift. Okay, here's the opt in for the training courses, which is essentially just a prospectus that or a guide that it can opt in for. But we can take either their prospectus or their guide and then turn that into an experience that's delivered over time so that people can determine if being a therapist is right for them. So that being said, that right now they're pulling, based on our previous conversation, they're pulling a lot of their therapists from those who go through the personal development track and they say, hey, this would be really fun to make money with. And so there's a bridge that goes from the personal development track to the certified therapist track. And that is, is this right for me? My, my sister-in-law is a, she's a fangirl of Marissa. to like hardcore fan girl. This is almost all she can talk about. It's wild. And she's the kind of know it all girl that, you know, she has a solution to everything that yells you. And she's been considering this, but she's still on the fence. So it's an interesting ecosystem. They have, here's their book of call, which is literally just a book of call. this apply now just goes to their certificate or their $4,500 course for their, they call it certification. So is only $4,500 and they have a $15,000 like business in a box version of that. based on what I understand. Anyway, here is the shop just to get a real quick overview. They sell bundles of hypnosis audios. And each one of these kind of has its own little bucket. It is very unclear which of these does the best other than best seller bundle. And then here they categorize these based on the buckets that they serve love and relationship, health, overcoming addictions, personal development, wealth and success, weight management. And these trainings are our courses. So there's also these other foundation certificate for hypnotherapy. um, foundation certificate for rapid transformational therapy, I guess you can get started for 240 bucks. Um, confident coach, certificate and applied and this is the one videos. They have trainings and then they have a certification and then a business and a box $15,000 thing. Uh, sold via phone call and live events, most likely. And also have a couple of webinars. I didn't mention that. Um, I don't really want to touch a webinar, but, uh, they have one. So it seems to me like the, the better questions would be which one makes them the most money. Um, is $39 a month, their current focus, if it is, why don't we turn their current assets into an automated evergreen experience that upsells people into the $39 month thing at a very, very high rate. At $39 a month, based on their current price points of their hypnosis audios and people going through the hypnosis, conversion rates gonna be really, really good. I wouldn't be shocked to have 15, 20, 30% in terms of immersion. So, this to me would be, I think we can be reasonable in our... communication of expectations. But to me, this would be a home run. I can't imagine not hitting a home run with this. This is right in my house.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's so you have to keep in mind what their goal is is to break the $20 million ceiling. And that's really difficult to do with the low ticket offer. So there's more to it than that. So here's some questions that I have. And I'm going to give you a stop your screen sharing I'll share from in a just a basic little thing. And just share some questions with you. But I'm going to show them to you so that you can visualize it as my share. So these are the things that we want to know because there's several different things. And I broke this down. What's the right down at your revenue? But percentage of your revenue comes from each offer. You can see the power in understanding that, right? How much of it from? But we need to know from everything, even if it's only 2% comes from weight loss. need to know all of it. Chances are pretty good that they won't know off the top of their heads how much they might have a guess. And so the next question is, what effort is applied to each offer, meaning what ads, landing pages, just follow up sequence, what did they focus on? We need to ask these questions and also get a read on their answers. So you can ask them ahead of time on the call. But I'll get to this in a second. Do you have any Google or any other kind of analytics? We will need access to that. What things are you wanting to do less of and why? For example, Brian wants to do, Brian Kurtz wants to do less events. He's hitting an age. And that's why, because he's just, he's tired. And so it wouldn't surprise me if this is something that they want to do less of also. What do you want to do more of, and why? I would imagine they want to do more of a scalable thing, because they're getting older. we don't want to leave the question. We want them to answer, and we want them to answer honestly. And why we're going to find the gold and the magic is where what they have gets optimized with and overlay what they want, where they want to go. So let's say that the primary, and this will be the biggest issue, and the biggest hurdle, if the primary source of their revenue is live events where they sell people into becoming a therapist and becoming certified. that's what they want to do less than. That's a problem. Now, there are a couple ways to look at this. So it's a problem meaning that's the thing that's already working and they want to do less on it. What you don't know is what the onus is that they're putting on you. Is it Seth, I saw your thing that you do and I want that or is it that I need to break a 20 million dollar a year ceiling. They seem like the same goal to them probably, but they're two separate things because you're not necessarily saying that that's the thing that we can do, especially if when they think that in their mind, they're thinking he can get us to do that without us doing the thing that we're already doing. But it's much more difficult. Let's say they're selling that for 10,000. or $15,000 or $20,000 or whatever, and they want to cut that source off, and now, like, how many sales do you have to make at $39 a month to recover one $20,000 sale? It's ridiculous, right? how much traffic exists right now? Do you even have the potential to be able to do that? So then, here's the thing, what they may be able to do is transfer what they've been doing at events to a lesser degree through your email automation sequence, so partly the selling and the transition from, I've been taking it, now I want to do it. Or I took a career path and I was doing this thing, and now I want to do this thing. So figuring out, whatever their highest revenue thing is and figuring out how to make that experiential. So let's say that their biggest source of revenue and audience and fan base is their events and it's because they what people tend to pay most for is two things results and access. Access doesn't have to have results. Access is I get to say I met so and so I get to say I get to take a picture with someone so people will do that because they think it makes them look big better so people will pay big money even if they get no results out of it just to go see these people so that's something right. But the other thing is results so there's there's another play where you don't necessarily get access but you can say I went through the same thing that John asked or after it or Jim quick or whatever, or you can see you learn from them because they're your mentors because you took a masterclass with them, that type of thing. It's the psychology and the angle behind all of it. the other thing is how much does it cost then to put on those events? Well, if they're paying for those speakers and chances are pretty good that they're paying money for their speakers because of who they have on them. Generally those level of speakers you're paying for them because they're not doing it for free. It's part of their job. They get paid to speak like Marissa gets paid to speak. So how much money does it cost them to put on their events and then how many times are they doing events? Actually, let's go look at and what's the conversion rate and what's the the revenue. So Let's see, these are physical events, three in April, two in May, two in June, nothing in July and August, one in September. So that's a lot of events and that's a lot of traveling. And let's say that whatever, like you could put a price on how much the event costs, how much time it takes to do and how much set up. And then you've got a conversion right on top of that and how many people actually get into it. So what if, and you can only put so many people into event because of cost, because of travel, because of location. But what if the events could be either their virtual or something else where they're not having to actually spend as much money or as much time organizing it and it's maybe It's an evergreen thing, and maybe they can't because it's not as experiential can't charge as much, but maybe they can get two or three as many people in there, and the conversion rate might be less, or the price is less, but because they can get more people into it because it's less cost prohibitive, and because it's not location prohibitive and all these other things, and then your, so let's say it's a two-day event, three-day event, let's see, these are four-day events, that's crazy, that's a one-day event, that's a four-day event, that's a one-day event, that's four-day event, so they have one-on-four-day events. Let's say for the four-day event, you know, you break it across three weeks, like event, it's immersive, and it's super... accountable, right? It's like, did you show up for this? Did you do this thing? Did you show up to the thing? Did you do this thing all the way through? And so there's a potential that they could replace their events or even, you know, let's say they replaced half their events at their age. That's a big deal. If they only did, you know, event at a quarter and so they could charge more money for it because they're doing it less, then it's a lot less stress to them, a lot less effort, less cost, but they can charge higher prices and get maybe more premium level people because they're still offering this, they're just doing it in a different way. I think that that's an angle that you could bring. I think also, if they don't have a CMO, like, that actually does a really good job, that is talking to them about scaling and other opportunities and leveraging. I think that that is kind of, yeah, who is it though? How good are they doing? Because they feel stuck and they're not leveraging their email list. all the things that you said, you're seeing them all dropping them off.
00:27:17 - Seth Ellsworth
a Dobson.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and how long has she been with them?
00:27:26 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not sure.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, if I'm a CMO, I'm not letting my people not do their email stuff and not be managing all of these things. So, you know, there's an angle of, do you want some more help? let's just like call yourself something. are you a scaling expert? you a retention expert? You're the completion. experts, but you have more gifts to bring to the table and a team who has other gifts to bring to the table and a $100,000 offer that you want to make. So I'm just telling, I'm just trying to help you figure out like what are some of the things that you could do and also learn from this in terms of like what people need. Generally, getting to this eight-figure business level, I can't even tell you, I've got one, my eight-figure attorney, how much is just left on the table and it's just, it's a slow walk, but it's a steady walk upwards, way less time working, way more money, and we don't have to change a lot. eight-figure people for the most part get it and you need them to get the help, they go get the help, like it's a whole different ball game than bottom seven figure people, like low seven figure people, which is what, you know, most, I can barely make six figures, even wrap their hands around, I think seven figures is great, but on a business level, low seven figure people are a lot of times just still struggling. Just, they got there by dumb luck a lot of times, or just by hustle and grit. Now, to get to eight figures, you have to have learned some things. A lot of that can still be hustled and grit. Like, it's really hard for people who aren't operating in the space to have any idea what it actually looks like. But, you know, showing up at events, there's a particular look they have, conversations they have, like, you just know that it's charisma, personality, obviously the psychology behind it, what they know, NLP, things like that. They know how to persuade people to do things. He also can teach and give real skills. It doesn't mean that they're great at business and optimizing things. And they know that, which is a key opportunity for you because you do understand conversions and conversion rates and how to combine. And also, I mean, it's just perfect because they understand the psychology behind it too. And you can ask them, you know, are you applying everything that you know about psychology to your email sequences? Answer is no, 100% the answer is no, right? So how much more powerful would your stuff be if you walked the walk, right? So you just show them the things that are left on the table. So going back to this, what percentage of, what do you call it? What's the breakdown of your revenue? What do you wanna do more of? What do you wanna do less of? That's gonna be really huge. And then where's the money coming from? from, and how do we leverage existing assets, traffic, et cetera, to break the $20 million dollar ceiling? And so, what have they been doing? Have they, even having to do more just to keep hitting the $20 million, they probably have, right?
00:31:53 - Seth Ellsworth
Because they're suffering just like most people.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, exactly. how would it feel Also, is it what is the ultimate financial goal, retiring, selling, because we want to understand, you know, what it's going back to what are they want to talk to you about, like, says, stay in your lane, just build us an email sequence. So we've got to be really clear on that. do you want me to just talk about how I can build you an email sequence and off to the biases, or would you like to really go into kind of a business audit and an opportunity on it for. What, what I see that you could be doing and. you know, there's that. So that's a conversation. These conversations, these questions, you could ask ahead of time, maybe fill that out, pray about it, and we can meet again on Thursday if you do end up talking to them at all, or Friday, go in and start asking questions. But at the end, have a pitch to make because, and also, is it increasing wood, increasing margins, even if top line dropped a little bit, but bottom line room. is our goal. Especially if it's scaling. and lower barrier to entry. So it means it should continue to be scalable and growing like the, you know, $39 a month offer. Because what I think that the offer is, is that we do two things. We figure out how to experience, like email experience if I. What we're doing in their events. And then also. Apply the same treatment to whatever their other top two top three offers are. So that's a lot of work that's ongoing. But. Most of the work is in analyzing their data. Which. we can do together. Chris is actually also very good at that. The automations, so we're definitely going to want what's his face, but we can also probably go hire other people. And I can help you with that and we can do that on the call together and just go look for people together. And then I have a whole process for hiring and testing people. We can do that together too because we're going to want more people than that. If we're creating this offer and doing it more. And then Chris would be writing the copy which he'll be paid for.
00:35:40 - Seth Ellsworth
We might have to find somebody else besides Matthew because he's tapped out.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find other people. promise that there are other people who are amazing at automations and they're just quietly working for other people because they're not. They don't want to run a business. I just want to get paid doing their thing. My experience with hiring people this year compared to even just three years ago, night and day difference, I'm shocked at what they know because the world has just changed that much, especially since COVID, in understanding online business. So the resources are massively increased. So I'm not worried about that, we shouldn't be. With Copy, if Chris can't do it, we've got a whole bunch of people to tap and we can tap through him or, again, we can go out and hire. whatever has to be built, the biggest thing is that we need to have the money for it in the sale. So it needs to be, this should for sure be $100,000, not 75, and with a potential growth. So let's say that $100,000 covers the email. experience of their live events, plus one other thing that leads up to the selling the live events. So it's like a breakthrough challenge. Obviously, that's right, right. And if it's not, then we plug in the things that are. So either way, what I'm saying is that we do something that is akin to building them a breakthrough challenge and T three, right? So it's the small thing that leads to the big thing and it's all an email sequence. And the goal is to do that in a quarter, but you have to build it and then you have to, and that may take longer than three months, depending on how long it takes them to get us all of their material. And you need just tell them that, you know, like, if you could hand everything over to us the same week that we close the deal, then, you know, 90 days we could do this. But the odds are that most people take a while to hand everything over, and it takes a few weeks, takes about four weeks, a lot of time to get all the stuff. So they'll send you stuff, and then you'll say, I see a gap, and then you ask for it, you send a request, and then it takes them a few days, and then they send it back. So there's this whole process. The first 30 days is really just a transfer of access to things that we need. Then you have to create the framework and say, this is what I think it should be, and go back to them and say, do you agree with that? That's another roughly about three weeks, and then you start to build it roughly about six weeks. So that's where we're at with the 90 days, and... And then, so is it like, once we get all the everything that we need is 90 days from there? No. Or 90 days total, factoring in, it could take up to a month to get everything we need. Yes. And if it takes longer than that, then it pushes our timeline out. And we're talking 90 days from the first iteration for the first iteration. So then it has to actually be sold and we put people through it. And then we have to see how it's doing and watch it. So that's another 90 days, because it takes time to get that feedback going. It takes time to see if something's stopping them and then we tweak it. So really, we're looking at a six month runway to make sure that we build, launch, and optimize the first level. of whatever it is that we built. So the six month thing allows some fluidity between the 90 days, you know, it doesn't have to be exactly 90 days that we launched it. The bottom line is after six months, you've got something and we've optimized it and by now you should be getting your money back if what we're doing is applying the email treatment to the thing that makes them the most money. So but they don't have sales copy for that. So they do for a live event but it's an angle. So there's a lot to be built. So the hundred thousand dollars is we're building this giant thing that replaces what you're already doing and it's scalable but also we're building the feeder into it. we'll be building the copy for it. We're going to, we're not going to just give it to you and say, look, we're going to give it to you and watch it with you. We're going to give it to you and make sure that it's working. Whatever is not working, we're going to fix. And we're going to stay here until you get your money back from your investment with us. And that shouldn't be a hard scary thing for us because it's just doing, I mean, this is stuff I do regularly. This is what chris us regularly. We look at the offers, we take, tweak it and test it. So let's do the map, you know, if you, hold on a second, if we sell it for $100,000 to buy a buy.
00:41:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Is that one other, one other thing that I think is a big little mover for John, like he wants his team to be top notch. And I get, I get the fee feeling that his CEO, Skip Johnson, and Amanda Dobson are new. I think he wants, I think he wants them to be trained. So that is another level of this. like, Hey, we're 100 K and 30 K per. Order, like we'll be fixing this optimizing it, making sure your team is fully capable of running with it and the understanding the strategy behind it because we've taught them what we've done and why. So that they could potentially build other assets without us.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, effectively, effectively working ourselves out of a job. So then maybe you sell it for it's 100 K plus for 90 days. And then it's. 150k for six months, which is a lot less for the follow-up, and we'll train your team. They can show up to all the calls where we are working together and diving into this. We will explain it. We will document it through a loom process of, look, this is what we built. This is the psychology behind it. This is how we analyzed it. This is why it's working. These are the things, the team that we need, you need an automation person, you need a copy person. We can tell you how to hire these people, you potentially, we'll do that. I think that's the, because honestly, an extra $50,000 for the three-month-light positioning at that way, 100k, it's 90 days. This is everything that we're building, and we're going to need, you know, An omniscience people were gonna have two copywriters like there's a lot to be built and and outline what has to be built Right, so there's the landing pages. There's the sales pages. There's the follow-up sequences that Nurture the people who didn't purchase from the landing page to the cell page For however many weeks and then there's the actual experience that is replacing a live event So you're talking about high-level Strategy that we're applying it to going through all of your material Making sure that we're choosing the best stuff and then turning it into experience like that is a lot of Mental work and we're paying high-level people to do it You mean Chris whoever else you know, we're we're looking at the stuff. So that's that's a lot and Then on top of that rather than building your dependency And then upon us, you know, obviously you're going to want to keep this skill and how as much as you can, we'll train your people to do it. And it won't really be an extra step. We're not going to say we're going to certify your people doing it, right, that they can do it. We're just going to make sure that they've got everything they need, which will be easy because what we're doing, if you want your clients to be really happy and you want to be able to get a raving testimonial, but you have to show them what you've done. have to show your work. So we'll create loom videos where we go through and say, here's everything we've done and broke it down so that they know and then we'll show them the data like, here was your baseline data. Here's what you were making. Here's this new offer. a completely new offer, right? Here's the revenue it's made. So we'll have evidence to show them so that they're like, I'm very happy I paid this money with you. I can see your results. That same material will work to train. There are other people because we'll show them this is what we did.
00:46:01 - Seth Ellsworth
This is the details of what we did.
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's one action, two benefits, and but also two values. We're not selling them on the reporting. It's just what's going to happen. We're selling them on training their team, but training their team is going to happen as a result of the reporting.
00:46:25 - Seth Ellsworth
Seven cents. Yep. So really just high level questions first about what's driving the revenue and then what do they want more of? What do they want less of? Customize our pitch to either that event based thing or selling the $39 thing for whatever reasons they want. then the offer under K over 90 days done for you 30k per quarter from there on out. Just stay on as long as they want. All this based on the fact that they want more revenue, they want less time spent, less resources spent, most likely, and their email game is currently abysmal.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Non-existent.
00:47:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, so let's say their angle is, like for us, we also have quick wins, for example, when somebody opts in to anything, we just add the little reply trick, and that is a forced multiplier for the health of their email list as a whole, which is huge. They have a huge, huge list. I don't think it's efficient. I don't think they have access to their whole list, because it doesn't seem that they're the email very well, but they do have a very big audience on social media.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have lots of assets. So, that's something else that you could bring down, like if you're going to do a... atomized invoice, the email health and an email audit, you could call it, but you can put a price point on that and you have to, you can put down why it matters, why it's necessary, you know, so if they're like, well, what is it? Because most of time, the biggest thing that you'll get, so people that pay the most expect the least, the difference is, what am I getting for my money? That's a conversation that you'll have. What does my $100,000 get? People with the least amount of money, they want to be told you're going to make X amount of dollars with it, right? They don't want that atomized details. They want to know the mouthwatering details. People that pay a lot of money just want the bullet list because they can look at the value themselves. So the email audits, why it banners, you can break it down, open rights, conversion rights, follow up sequences, inbox placement, email help, all of these things are, and you can say like how much money do you spend on email, on your email holds, how big is your list, like how much money are you bleeding, and I don't know how much you want to get involved into it, but if you're going to be doing an email sequence, I would imagine that needs to be part of your service anyway, which is going and getting their sender score, and figuring out getting a report, you know, what's their domain health, what's their domain score, where are they emailing from, all of that, an email audit should be built into it, and it should be high value. So that, you know, look if I'm going to have you build all these emails, are they even going to get to the inbox? of your people, and what types, like where are you sending from, all these things. Anyway, so an itemized invoice of here's the copy, here's the automations, I don't know if you want to do that, I don't know, we really have to think about that, and I think looking at it will help us make a decision. Do we do it that way, or do we not put a price point next one, but say these are the things that we're going to do, email audit, write the copy, here's the types of copy that we're going to be doing, X amount of landing pages, a range of landing pages, a range of email follow-up sequences that are solely to ascend the opt-in person, the lead to sales, and then the email experience is a whole separate thing, right? That is the primary chunk of of everything. But for the email experience to work right and to work best, it means all of these other pieces into it. And then there's the analyzing, right? The iterations and optimizations, all the things that happen. So if you're putting together an itemized list and you're not putting, I would not put a price next to each of the things, but I would create an invoice. And this really should be your offer. And it will be specific to them, but you'll be able to model it for other people because it's going to be very, very, very similar, right? Which is these are the things that we're offering. So the small thing that leads to the big thing, so that there's a whole ascension process, the $39 all the way up to whatever the, become a certified, whatever, RTT. person, a therapist, in that thing, in their specific skill sets, in their therapy, that's telling me my brain right now. I'm also looking at like all their different words and things on the page while I'm looking at this, my brain is reading one word and saying another. Anyway, that's what it should be, so we should have that ready in a Google Doc, so we show up, we ask them all the questions, and ask them the questions. Basically, it's going to solidify what we already know, and it may allow us to tweak, so plan on some conversation back and forth between you and I in the background, as the call is happening, and then we give them the offer, and you have to decide what you want the price point to be, it's $100,000 $150,000. But the burden is that you have to convince them that they're going to get their money back and grow from it. Because, I mean, why spend their time if all they're going to do is just get their money back. They need it to grow. needs to be more than what they put in time and energy. Coming out with a better marketing team as a result of it, because you've gone through and got data. So, you're going to want to ask these questions. And are there marketing people going to be there on the call, do you know?
00:53:40 - Seth Ellsworth
So far as I know, I'm at Adopson and Skip Johnson, the CEO and the CMO, are as well as Marissa and John Davies are to be on there. Okay.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, we're going to want to ask very specific questions, which will reveal what they know. they don't. So we're going to want to ask, okay, um, do you have a heat map on your pages? What percentage, like, okay, how much traffic do you get?
00:54:11 - Seth Ellsworth
Hold on a second. Where's my question? can figure that out.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can figure what out.
00:54:16 - Seth Ellsworth
The heat map. I can just find the code on there.
00:54:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you're missing the point. That's not the point. The point is we want to show what they know. So, um, do you have a heat map? It's a focus on what the point is there. Heat map. How many unique visitors per month? What's the bounce rate?
00:54:45 - Seth Ellsworth
What's the bounce rate?
00:54:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did people say? Do people stay on site? primary traffic sources, and what's the average time per landing page version great for offer. For average part value, per offer, or TV, per customer, per channel, per offer. Guarantee you they don't know these answers, almost nobody does. If they know them, they have an amazing marketing team, but we know that they don't have an amazing marketing team, because if they did, they'd be doing a better job of emailing, right? Okay, so what these questions are going to reveal is your marketing team isn't looking at what they need to do again, because the marketing team is going to be there and they're not going to have the answers. So if you don't know these things, do you have analytics we can review because we need days answers to optimize what you're doing. So that allows you to add in to your value offer, and you can cut it if you don't need it, but it should already be in a Google Doc with everything that we're offering, which is because we will train your marketing team on how to... make sure that you're optimizing all of your sources and that they know all of these things, but also they can review the results of your marketing efforts to make sure that each of these things that we're looking at is at optimal levels. And you just, that's just part of your value stack up. Here's the price point, but here's all the things that we're gonna get. So you're gonna, all these questions should reveal numbers and data and all that data should sell your offer for you.
00:57:43 - Seth Ellsworth
Seems to me we'd have to send all this stuff prior to.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you just have to have it written ahead of time because if you send it prior to, you miss the opportunity of revealing what's not known because they, their people can go scramble and look for these things. You need the CEO to know that their people don't know this stuff. And you need everybody to be exposed on the call that they don't know this stuff. So because they need to hire you. They know they need to hire you. they don't want to do is pay the price. What they don't want to do, their team doesn't want to be exposed. It's not knowing it. Why aren't you doing this? But what they want most is to break that $20 million a year ceiling and work less hard and have the money that they want to have. If they want those results, they have to get out of their own way. Why didn't they get out their own way to begin with? Because nobody confronted them with what they need to see.
00:58:56 - Seth Ellsworth
All right. Can you send me that? Nope. Can you copy it over?
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So we have a looking at the Looking at the calendar invite we have a total of a half an hour Yeah, do you think they're gonna want to stop talking to you so if they do like first of all you ask all these questions really quickly when you have them And if your pitch is prepared you can get to them quickly I'm just posting it in the bottom of your work flow. You can move it put it wherever you want to so Eat the Having less time can just mean that they're foaming at the mouse dinner because they're like holy crap They just showed us everything we don't have and Everything we don't have is clearly why we're not getting where we want to be They also just showed us how they can give it to us and they're gonna they their brain's going to need to close that loop. Either we're hiring them or we're not. But if we are, then we need to figure this out if we need it, we need to get there.
01:00:10 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and you can tell them, look, only take on one of these a quarter. So, you know, I just want to, I think that this is ideal. I love what you're doing. I love what you're teaching people. You know, here's why I think what you do matters and why I want to be a part of it. And here's why I think what you're doing matters and why the world needs more of you. And here's what we're going to do to get that for you. also to make sure that you've got enough energy to keep serving because people need you. And this is how we're going to make it less work so that you can conserve that energy. We'll build this experience that can keep going. Even when you can't like that.
01:01:09 - Seth Ellsworth
I got those notes. A couple of thoughts. Thing number one, I'm just looking at my pension to way over deliver. I look at their four buckets that they have on their freebie page. They're four different audios. And I'm like, well, why don't we just build a four or five six day thing for each of those. And then, but that's four of these, which is four times the work.
01:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's your upsell after we've done what we're going to do. If you want to keep working with them. And if you don't, you can just say, hey, here's what I recommend. Go apply what we've taught you to each of these. Have your team do it.
01:02:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you want to consult with me?
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's a fee for consulting on it, and we'll have your team build it, but this my recommendation to you It's not where you should focus because you want to make them more money Right, so either way we should just focus on one of these channels one experience That we have a high probability of being home run because that's where most of the revenue is already coming from And then the 30 the 30k per quarter is essentially just for oversight and consulting And you don't want to package up like that. No Because they'll know if you say that they're gonna be like why am I paying that much for oversight and consulting?
01:02:52 - Seth Ellsworth
No So how do I How How do I not
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Stell myself into a corner why offering what I just told you so to me that leaves like a it leaves like a okay then what do we build next why are you even thinking about that i don't know it's more my mind naturally goes oh that's your problem you keep trying to extend things when instead of letting them finish and be done right maybe probably because i care more about the recurring revenue oh i was just about to tell you that's exactly what it is because you're like i got to pay the next month's bill you don't need to look at them for doing that so if you sell this and if you sell another one or two to other people with ending right and you want it to end because that's your wow factor and your wow factor is what gives you the big price points. You don't want to stay in somebody's team. You don't want to stay in their business. We let them come back to you for one-off consulting or something or whatever, but just go in, do the wow, then leave and leave them wild. So they keep telling people about your wow factor. But don't get in the grind of their business and having to and feeling like you're a part of their team, because then you lose the leverage that that gives you your price point, but also the energy and the way that they see you. And it's important for everything that you're doing with your high level people that that's how that stays, that dynamic stays that way. The money that we get from this needs to be budgeted so that there's money going to building out your own scalable office. That's where your next money is coming from. It's not from here. There is a very clear ending process we build the thing we leave if you want more you can ask us for more We'll give you a price point and it's not going to be stressed And you're not going to be built into a thing to be only thing that you're going to do from this point is consults Because we'll we'll tell you your team how to do it if you want to pay a higher price We'll even go hire people for your team to put in there and we'll teach them, but there's always an ending period So in this scenario, you wouldn't You wouldn't do a Risk reversal scenario where you'd say hey, it's a hundred K We'll stick around until you double that Sure, I would and there's no reason not to because that's not building you into a truck Because there's no way there's not enough potential for that money and
01:06:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you think it would be silly to to go for some type of a percentage?
01:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because this is the first time you've even tried this offer. Get some, get some evidence under your belt, get some more experience. Now you can do it at the end and say, if you want to keep me, here's how you can do it. It's a percentage.
01:06:27 - Seth Ellsworth
Because if that were the upsell instead of the 30k per quarter, that's a hell yes.
01:06:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I don't even know where you got the 30k per quarter afterwards. No, the first like $100,000 for the, no, actually it was the response to yours. Like we go through and look at the transcript. When I was looking at, if you want to make it $150,000 for six months, and it wasn't considered Salting it was 30k per quarter. Basically we're building out these things. It wasn't like that.
01:07:05 - Seth Ellsworth
It wasn't 30 paper quarter for consulting I'm not sure where that came from Yeah Um, I would love to do 100k for building one of these and then they pay a percentage for us to go in and build out the other three That would be awesome Or four or five or six of these Okay, well don't get ahead of yourself because you've never had a yes on this offer at all No, I haven't And never built it Yeah, that's an end zone that I would that's an end zone that I would love for this particular business because It is A high degree of confidence with this one Um Well, there's so many unknowns including managing the team and and doing the whole thing together So I really want you to focus on what we've already talked about Yep, I'm part of minimizing it putting it on one
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
clear offer was to start to finish and I'm not going it would be cool if like just don't do that because that can sabotage everything if we get through this and then you want to be it would be cool all day long go do that but first you need a confident sale that you can close that you can take care of the family with you can have a team that you can build out your own offer which is going to take your time and focus and and be very very very practical with this there's lots of time for it would be cool if later and there'll be lots of opportunities but right now it just needs to be here's the offer here is that we can just knock it out of the park and this is what we're going to do for it cool and then in terms of price points like how do how do we be
01:09:00 - Seth Ellsworth
that we haven't taken swing yet. How do we confidently value this?
01:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build out what I told you, which is the, like, itemized invoice that doesn't have a price point on it, right? But here's all the thing you're building. So quickly, repeat back to me what I said we're building.
01:09:20 - Seth Ellsworth
You asking me that or is that what I should ask them?
01:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you.
01:09:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Well, I don't know exactly because it would be slightly different depending on whether it's the event based version or the low ticket front end.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should not be the low ticket front end and you shouldn't give them that option. If you want to knock it out of the park, you mean tell them let's experience it by your event into an email experience. But to build up to that, we'll take one of the low ticket options to build up to that and bridge a gap because if you want to get your money back, then There has to be high level stuff if you're trying to get if you're gonna be there till they get their money back at a $100,000 with a $39 offer you can be there forever Certainly they have six hundred thousand people on their email list Yeah, how many people do you think actually open it and how many people are even still valid email?
01:10:19 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't know anything about their email help I don't But you can assume it's crap We can assume it's crap. They're also flying ads and they have very active socials. So there's a lot of available to them Okay, so how many thirty nine? Here's here's how I see this taking Taking their hypnosis audios that they're currently giving away as a lead magnet Turning that into an automated email-based experience that converts it 30% to the $39 thing That's easy. That would be a very very simple simple thing, taking a live event and automating that to get the same result as or some result, no, not even similar, doesn't have to be someone that's either way, taking a live event and putting it into this type of a structure much more difficult. Is it possible?
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
course it is.
01:11:23 - Seth Ellsworth
It's much better.
01:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bottom line is done right up today because we need to have time to tweak it. The itemized, what the invoice would be. So you asked, how do I confidently sell that $100,000? This is how. If you can't write it out and look at that and go, hell yeah, that's a $100,000 offer and also it's not going to be a whole ton of work for me because I'm having other people do it, then there you go. And if you can't do that, maybe you don't need to have a call for it. So write it up send it over Thursday.
01:12:02 - Seth Ellsworth
can work on Tweaking it and make sure we've got it nailed down and then probably see what happens Yeah, I think I think we should probably be prepared for Both options the event based one or the That the hypnosis audio version That seems to me that they're right there. I'm just Green with the way you just said It seems to you what it seems to me that if they've turned their focus to the thirty nine dollar a month thing for whatever reason So they've spent a lot of money all ready To to grow that It'll be interesting to see What their priorities are versus where they're currently generating their revenue, which has got to be the events To me it make that makes the most that's you're going to make more $15,000 sales from the event than you are from any other, they're not doing any other marketing. So it has to be from the events. What is it already wise? Is it the event or is it this new $39 thing? That'll be interesting because the revenue won't likely justify focusing on the $39 thing, like you said. But they may see that as their path to getting off the hamster wheel. I don't know.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so to break even on a $100,000 investment in us on the $39 offer, we need about 2,500 sales. But if there's an episode, if there's something else next, $1,000 or $2,000 offer, and maybe it's something in becoming a therapist or whatever the next step is. There's some gap that we don't know about that exists, some mid-level offer that is not an event that we're replacing, but it could be the training or whatever, maybe a certification process or pre-certification process where you can sell it for, whether it's a few hundred or a thousand or two thousand, you know, the burden on that, $100,000, a hundred people buying $1,000 offer, and with that amount of traffic that they have, that's a no-brainer like that. We could do that easily. So I think that there's a missing piece there that we could plug in, which was one of the things I was thinking about before, and I don't remember how $39 members to $15,000 sales. Well, are they getting $39 members to $15,000?
01:14:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Sure they are, because he mentioned that the whole point of that group. It was to nurture them, to ascend to the bigger things.
01:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there, and there could be segments, you know, are there different types of things that they teach? they teach one thing, and so maybe they ascend them up through, instead of going straight to the $15,000 thing, it's, well, there's this aspect, right? This is, let us teach you about CBT, it's $1,000, let us teach you about the hemotherapy, it's $1,000, you know, and step them up through something. There's a path, and there's missing data points, where we can do that, but what they need to understand is that your way of doing it isn't just email, it's a very specific way based off of psychology, which they should appreciate that speaks to them, and uses, know, accountability, and actually is very much CBT, because it's getting into the head, like, who are you, what do you want, why are you doing what you're doing, are you watching? yourself behave the way you're behaving, is it getting you the outcome that you want? No, it's not. So you need to change your behavior. So here's how you change your behavior and changing your behavior is, you know, leaving them through a sale at the same time. That's what you've been doing. It is very related to CBT, which is observing your behavior, asking yourself if the current behavior that you have is getting the results that you want or not. And if it's not, then what are some options for how you can behave to get more of what you want. And then as you're watching yourself, are you seeing yourself through the right thing? Do the wrong thing? we get fixed it? That's it? That's the cognitive behavior there. It's a repeat.
01:16:56 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. Awesome. By the way, I have heard back from Landon Ray.
01:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have or have not?
01:17:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I have.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And?
01:17:10 - Seth Ellsworth
He agreed to the 10K thing.
01:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the 10K thing?
01:17:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Just a power day at onto Port Campus in June.
01:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
01:17:23 - Seth Ellsworth
So he's, I need to send him a one pager and he'll send, he'll get his accounting to send 5K and then 5K on the day of.
01:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
01:17:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So we've got some movement somewhere.
01:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, I think for the most part, this week you've got, I know you have things that you have to fulfill and you need to get prepared for this. I don't know what else you have going on, but I would like to know what else you're going on. an appointment I need to get to. So I need to wrap up. But I think that this is going to go well. Either they're actually open to making the changes or not, but based off of the conversations that's happened so far, I would say that they are. And if you can just show them how, you know, this just makes perfect sense, but also clearly they need to stop chasing it. That conversation about, how much basically, how much harder have you had to work to get to that 20,000? Are you just coasting or have you had to work harder just to keep hitting that $20 million? And if you've had to keep working harder, how long can you do that? if 20 million is the number and you can't keep chasing harder and harder and harder, then you have to go smarter. this is what we've got, and you know, break it all down. It'll be important to Like, at some point, guaranteed, I've never been to a call where there wasn't something that was high value that I could add to it. They need to be primed for just even listening. So decide how you want to represent me. But it works best if you've done that ahead of time. This is Tina. This is what she's bringing to the table. So if I ask a question, because everybody's ego is a little bit different. I don't imagine they're going to be high ego people, but it could be. Um, so it's sometimes people like who knows this and why they ask them questions. So it's best to avoid that by pre-framing this, who she is. That's what she does.
01:19:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep. I already, I think I already did that past. Yeah. And my, in my original email, which you didn't see. Um, I said, I don't do anything without. her. She keeps from painting myself into a corner.
01:20:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. That's enough. So that way, if there's there's anything I want to help out with, and I'm just like, I know I can add some power value to here, then then it'll be there for the most part. I'm just going to be quiet supporting and texting back and forth. But if I sense that there's a way that I'm like, okay, well, I can answer this question powerfully and clearly, then I'll do that.
01:20:28 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. I'll bring you in. Would you want me to, is this like a tag team thing, or would you just hop in? Meaning like, hey, Tina can speak to that.
01:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would probably just hop in. wouldn't even want to be to recall if I'm not hopping in, because then I can't be myself. And if I can't be myself, I don't want to be there.
01:20:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. So I will work on this invoice for both scenarios.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because then you'll have an option. can just say you, without them knowing, just pick the one you want to show that and then go ahead and screen show so they can take look at it and break it down.
01:21:13 - Seth Ellsworth
If I had, if I had my druthers, what I would do for them, this would be, this is their entire business model. They have four of these running with their most successful four verticals that have proven to be the most profitable. They drive all of their traffic to those four. Those dump $39 per month members and then quickly ascends those who have achieved a high level of confidence with that and introduces the opportunity for a career with those things. Or it assesses their need for deeper therapy. And so all roads lead through this $1.39 month thing that liquefies at costs and makes it infinitely scalable, and we just pick people off and push them down each, each path based on, you know, any number of things that could happen. But we could build one of these to go on the inside that ascends them into the career.
01:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and the great thing about this is that this is the type of thing that is perpetual evergreen lifelong. So whether you need therapy or you need to keep sharpening your own saw and being better at what you're doing. Come back to us as the authority for people that can help you, you know, continue your mental health journey, being as strong as you possibly can. So you live with us forever. That's the goal, right? Or, or same thing as becoming a therapist because the bottom line. as we all know that we need support and we're here to offer that to you. So whatever we need built is perpetual. mean evergreen not in terms of an offer that never expires but also your potential to stay with us as a customer lasts forever as well. And so we want to make sure that we show them that hey we're looking at it that way and we know that. And so one of the goals and the metrics would be life's and value their customer whatever is we want to increase that and extend that. And what you do says in the nurturing through email sequence has the greatest potential to do what should have already been on their radar and probably already the goal but probably not their success in the past.
01:23:48 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got to go but send me over what you come up with in your two versions and then we'll just you keep hammering that out. But I imagine that you'll probably show up to that call more confident that you have in any other cell call, even though it's the highest, like, have you ever sold any one thing for $100,000 for yourself?
01:24:15 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, I sold a website for 220.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm about like this service something.
01:24:22 - Seth Ellsworth
No.
01:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, selling a website or business is a whole different thing. This is selling you as a service, um, doing this particular thing that there's been a lot of, well, just a huge lack of clarity and confidence. So going into this success way is a big deal. But I, your confidence seems to be growing and the clarity growing almost daily, definitely weekly. And I think that you have the potential just to go in and knock it out of the park Friday.
01:24:58 - Seth Ellsworth
Thank you. I was just saying, I think we can ROI these guys before we even build anything.
01:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build anything before we build anything. Well, I don't know how, how you would do that without doing something. What do you mean? Well, I mean, before we build the experience, just, okay, don't say anything and then say the experience, but yeah, build that thing like just with a few tweaks, maybe you say that, but the language matters very much because that's almost like we can get your money back without doing anything. That's what it sounds like.
01:25:42 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. that's not what I'm.
01:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So anyway, so like you could say something like where I think we can ROI just by making a few actually simple tweaks that we can implement into your system within a couple of days. that can start, you know, getting you money while we're building the big thing. The language is different, it takes more, but it's factual, and it's clear. You know it's clear because it's reflected as email, you know, and improved this type of thing, and that doesn't take a lot of effort. But that clarity makes a big difference because when you're not there, you create confusion. Confusion creates friction. Friction slows down sales. You don't want any confusion. You don't want any friction. So be very clear when you say anything on the call.
01:26:39 - Seth Ellsworth
Cool. right.
01:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
definitely have to go. Let's keep working this out. Work on the two different offers and send over what you got when you got it.
01:26:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. Thank you much.
01:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. You're welcome. Good talk. Talk to you soon.
01:26:54 - Seth Ellsworth
Bye.

He doesn't like MacBooks. I like Apple. I have an iPhone. I just don't like them for computers where everything else is Windows based and it makes everything turn.
00:04:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Hi.
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not worth spending the time arguing on, so I probably have an extra laptop somewhere in her office that could magically end up in her hands, but it's not an Apple. It's as long as it's fast. I just care if it's fast and it should have solid state drive and like all the RAM and VRAM and everything else. Huh?
00:04:35 - mark sweet
That's fine.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you Mark. Thank you very much. I love you.
00:04:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
like you. The doctor, Dr. Rickwood, said he will get me one. I think he already ordered and that's Windows that could be faster.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just at the very least, like if it takes a while to do meaning, then it's inefficient and that's not that that time is no.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I agree.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It compounds and it costs too much to wait on technology that's inefficient. So you were, let's just do this because you sent me that message and I've got your notes about I kind of bullet pointed them with question.
00:05:17 - mark sweet
You guys want to talk together for a few minutes? Well, I just finished up one more quick thing that I do have to do. Okay, why don't you guys talk for a moment and then I will be back by in 10 minutes.
00:05:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:05:27 - mark sweet
Sorry.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fine because that's what I was saying we could do anyway. So, Okay, so the meeting I probably will ask a little bit more questions about but the insecurities, let me mute my phone about the male dominated nature of the meetings in the field.
00:05:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
mean Yeah, that one is that day I just feel less than and
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one thing I would say, being a woman in a man's world, that is not the same as doctors. I said, medicine is the oldest and women just weren't even allowed, even consider a woman. It's too delicate, can't handle it, it's its own kind of thing and that is a long indoctrination period that's generational because a lot of doctors have doctors in their family. They're talking Ivy League and indoctrination where, you know, like it's a culture intentionally. So one of the best things that you can do is really listen in the beginning, even if you have good ideas and pay a close attention. So if you're meeting with the same kind of people often, you want to study them, no. who they are, know what their strengths are, know what their weaknesses are, know what their blind thoughts are, and formulate what you have to say before you say it, not reactive, which I'm sure that you're good at doing, but be strategic about it. I don't know how well you'll be able to be heard in something like that. But if the first few times you wait to say something that nobody has bothered to bring up or acknowledged, and you can say it clearly, succinctly, and in the realm of, okay, here is a problem, here's a solution, or here's a problem, and here's what it's costing us and why we need to have a solution, that type of like if you you'll be respected faster and waiting until you can do that will help. So are you going to be in a situation where you're dealing with the same doctor frequently?
00:08:10 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the other thing is having so are there women around at all or just a few of them or none?
00:08:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So I guess in those two specifics and I that I said one is when I was with Dr. E and we go to the three hospitals that I have to go. We're in the doctor's lounge because we got food. We're in the doctor's lounge and I'm the only female there. Okay. became like like if I can like shrink myself I have that feeling like Dr. E though no he's a good person, he always include me like, hey guys, this is my new nurse practitioner, this is Chona, like introduce me and then I said hi. So, what is your body language and your eye contact when you're in that meeting? I guess, well, there's the two settings. The first one is on the doctor's lounge, so it's more relaxed, we're eating. So we're, there's just everyone is in different tables. I think, I know I was able to like hide my feelings of, you know, feeling little, but during the Zoom meeting, I don't have my camera on, but for some reason, I feel more, you know, less than in that particular space because they're talking, all of the panels are male doctors. and lawyers, and there's no women that speak up during that Zoom, and in general, I've attended a couple of them, and there's maybe two or three out of 50 people, so there's, you know, not a lie. But I guess, like you said, I think there's a lot of it being new. Like you said, there's a lot of people.
00:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what's wrong?
00:10:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
As soon as I feel more comfortable and in all aspects, like the main job right now is the one that I'm just, you know, to get the routine. The second and third, I don't know if you remember, like the main job, then the second of the PI and the third is Washington. That's probably going to be a while. I hope not. The second one, I have a new patient today and I was nervous, I think there's some frustrations in a way that I don't have a lot of control on putting the patient to the list, putting the patient on the appointment list. Even that I don't have that capacity and so I have to, there's multiple point people that I have to talk to and that's what frustrates me a little bit. I feel like it's inefficient, I feel there's too many hands and if that's what term but I had my first patient actually, actually it's marks that I am, that referred to us.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, so I'm excited about that one, so there's something to think about is what you can do, like what are some of the things that you could do in order to feel more confident and strong? And I think and I don't know if you would be able to do this and maybe you can do it in breaks and later, but just write down some of the things that you notice. I'm gonna give you a lot of things actually to tell you and these are about mental fortification and strength. Also, do you like reading books at all?
00:12:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do read books now on my phone, but I'm still old school. I like to read not I'm locing on fiction, but that's good.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you like psychology books or the book or persuade
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Psychology is always. I think it's everyone's favorite.
00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not.
00:13:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Some people are stupid. I love it.
00:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do too.
00:13:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do too.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'll give you a list of some books to check out. And if you don't enjoy them, then don't read them. Okay.
00:13:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, all your books would be good too.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you'll like this. So, and I'll tell you why I'm going to recommend them. But they have to do. I think they'll be very useful for you in the dynamic that you're in. Okay. There's a power dynamic always in play. And there's two values out of reading these particular books. that is number one. Know that there are people who are consciously employing these tactics so that you can be aware and observe them with the people around you and know who to write clearly. There's a lot of times as women we have intuition. which we can't validate and we can explain how we feel to some people but they'll be like yeah but whatever so but then if you go read the toxic she'll go they did this this this and this therefore this is who they are and what they're doing right and then it's really hard for people to refute you when you're like this is the problem right so like if you want to tell mark or if if there's somebody else that you're working with you can you can be very specific other than i i feel this way you can say i observe this habit this habit this habit that is um like part and parcel with this type of behavior whatever you know what i mean so you might laugh at the titles and i don't know if mark here's that but um one is called the art of war i think i've heard that before but i haven't read okay um the other one is 48 laws of power okay why robert green who's a psychologist i think And I think it's also 48 laws of human nature. And then he wrote a book called Pre-Swasion, which I think would be good. they cover a lot of similar topics, from different angles and different anecdotes. So the art of war is short. And it's very, the language is more like ancient philosophers. It's by Sun Tzu, an ancient Asian philosopher. But 48 laws of power actually breaks it down a lot and gives a lot of anecdotes and stories and how these tactics were used historically. The reason I think that it's so powerful is because when you start to see the behavior, you're like, oh, I noticed this person does this, and that person does this. And it just increases. So you have a background in psychology, but when you apply this psychology towards a professional dynamic, and you don't have just a professional dynamic, it's a specific dynamic of doctors. Doctors are for the average user unimpeachable, what they say goes for most people, and even if the person disagrees, they will capitulate. That is a powerful dynamic, and it's not questioned or softened, so that's what you're up against as just the foundation of starting. So for sure, there should be a warm-up period where you strategically just staying relatively quiet. Not playing small. I want you to take up space. I want you to lean in. want you to look with your eyes. I want you to make a comment. Like, you know, if something makes sense, you know, I want you to use a big girl voice and project a little bit, but not, you know, trying to be a man, not trying to be masculine, not trying to be hard, just in, in Chona's natural power, like whenever, so think about what you sound like when you are convicted and you feel like you're in a space where you can say exactly how you feel about anything. What does that volume look like? What does that body language look like? What does that stance look like? That is, I want you to be conscious of using that there, but only when you're confident that you know what you're talking about and that you have something valuable to say because this sooner that you make a strong, solid, you know, impression, that the better your opportunity to influence change will be. Speaking of influence change, influencing There's one more book that I would love you to read that hasn't it doesn't have nothing to do with psychology, but it's called switch by chip and then Heath and I can give you a list of these and write them down later and The subject about it is how to make change stick when change is hard and something like that but it It It talks about I don't know basically looking for what are the angles that you have? To use to get the change that you see that needs to be made to that needs to happen and How do you look for? you can leverage right so let's say you want to make a change and the first objection is We don't do it that way. It costs much money. It takes much time I'd have to hire I'd have to train. It's difficult. It's depending the blood mark love blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just swinging. We can't see if he's there, because he's not on video. Anyway. But that's the pushback that you get. So what you do is you basically anticipate proactively all of the objections that you might get, and before they even get a chance to object, you address them. So let's come up with an example of something that's today.
00:19:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
day. Yeah. So that example is with this new patient that Mark says, Oh, I have a being patient. And so he said, you know, he says, you know, you can call the patient at this time. So he set me up to talk to the chiropractor, which is very helpful. And you know, we just discussed a little bit of what he did to the patient so far. And then I hold the team, email them, I said, I need this patient, if you can please add this patient to the list as a telehealth, and as a lean patient, telehealth, under Dr. E. So, in the response, well, I said at a time clock, I didn't write a time frame on when I need the patient to be added. And by the time I need to call the patient, said, can you please add the patient? And then the response was usually with lean patients, we need to see them first in the office. But the thing is with this type of patient, we need to get them when we get them. So, I have to do what I have to do. Dr. does telehealth as a new patient. I guess the pushback was, this is not how we do things. Basically, that's what she's saying. So, I, my response was, it's okay, I spoke with Dr. E about it, but that was, that was my excuse, but yeah, I should have had a better answer and not always anchor in Dr. E as the reasoning or the final say.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so yeah, now, what would be the logic and the reason why it would make more sense to do telehealth?
00:21:29 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it's more of, I guess more, I guess the reasoning would be to get them in our system as soon as we can, because some of these patients are hard to, well, I don't know, I just heard it from our, but some of them are hard to talk to, you have to, you know, so it's just a matter of, like, time we need to get them when we can get them, right?
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that you might say is say, well, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, would you want to choose telehealth, and then you'd be quiet and let them answer. if they try to circumvent the question, the question was, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, which by the way, this is the option and you tell them, you know, confidently, would we just not see them at all? Is that what I'm hearing?
00:22:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And I just want to make sure I understand. Right. And fortunately, the patient is a little bit of a, you know, special that's the term that marks use and she's okay, but finally, she agreed for some reason she agreed to come tomorrow to the office. So then I have to send an email again, can you put them tomorrow on the list? So I I sound redundant. I asked them to add today and then add tomorrow, you know, but to me, I got all 99% of my information that I need, and I just need the patient just wants a lot of hand-holding of the explanation, so it's actually good that she's coming to the office tomorrow, but I feel okay. Sorry, I just need to be okay, not conforming to their system right away, or I don't know if that's the term I'm trying to see.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, there's a few different ways you can look at it. Do you need this job? Are you going to be just fine if you didn't have it?
00:23:54 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, especially the extra, I guess this is the second part of the business, I guess. being one, which is what I wanted to make sure that we are good.
00:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A big part of this power dynamic that people are able to have is that they feel like most people need a job and so they will tolerate certain types of behavior because if you don't, you're gone or you're not life miserable. And if you know inside your heart, we're like, I'm either going to do it my way or I'm not going to do it at all because you don't have to have this job. And it is not the only opportunity for you and Mark to do an arrangement like this.
00:24:37 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
They're like something.
00:24:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you believe abundantly that there's going to be a place where you can fit without playing small or holding back, that will come out energetically. So, now I have been called a and all kinds of things many times, but I don't use this energy to plow over anybody. I do it because. My best interest is the company's best interest.
00:25:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
want to see everybody win.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to be clear. want to be frank and I need you to know you don't get to plow for me. So either I'm valued and I'm valuable and I'm wanted right because I'm not here just for paycheck. have things to do that are important to me. I care about this company. I care about these patients. If you don't value that. If what you want is a robot, I'm not your person. I am autonomous. I think I have things to value now. Do you have to conform to the system sometimes because the system makes sense? Makes the most sense is leveraged. Fine. Show me how it's leveraged. Show me how it makes the most sense so that I can buy into it and support it and get behind it. If you can't show me how this system makes the most sense and I have a suggestion that is good for the company. company and good for the patient and then I need to know I'm where that's going to be heard. You can't, I wouldn't say you just dive right in there immediately but I would say that you at least try to have that type of conversation because if you come in and play robot and then try to be autonomous that's not going to work very well. Right. So if you have a question, present the question. Now if you have a follow up question or follow up argument then you might think strategically okay is this the time for it or do I kind of progress through the you know the the barriers right a little bit at a time but basically every time somebody pushes back on me I'm just going to say okay but at least once this right you know so that they're aware that you're thinking about the process you're thinking about the value you're thinking about the system and It matters to you. Does that make sense?

Right. Yes. So Tuesday, I spoke with the manager by myself because I wanted to learn how their process works because Dr. E, you know, he's not interested on the logistics of this. He just he just wants to make money. But at the same time, I know he's a good person. He's a good doctor, but he doesn't want to, you know, diminution of like small things. he went, so he basically just dropped me off to the to the manager of the office and say, you know, you guys figured it out.
00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if his priority is making the most money though, and let's say, let's say that getting the patient in the sickness is the fastest way to the money, right?
00:27:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That's why he he agreed because I asked him right away. He said, I have this patient, I get them and get them in. But then, you know, that's why he sent the email. Because he's in the OR today, so he sends the email to the people, the key people, and says, you know, moving forward, China will be included in all PI cases, know, CC her, this and that. And then, you know, I respond to that email, I have a new patient coming in, this is the info, please add it to the list for telehealth today. So that's how I said it, but I know they have a system that, you know, obviously I'm new and I'm still learning their system is something either I will have to conform and maybe adjust based on how I think will be more efficient for us.
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is a hospital, right?
00:28:52 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So it's a medical group. So this is clinic. So it's private, yes, which Dr. E Owens and he has. of a, okay, I have a, he have a manager, but he's just all over the place. I cannot rely him to just do the, I will have to drive this, because he's just nice and he spread himself to thin. He's just, I won't, I just won't have, he's gonna rely on me, basically.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So doctor, I just want to make sure I understand the dynamic theory.
00:29:26 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Doctor E owns this medical clinic, medical, he's the one right, just him.
00:29:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He owes it.
00:29:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And so, okay.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he hired you.
00:29:35 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And we did that agreement with Mark and I.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what is the scope of your stewardship? And let's let me break it down that way. Let's start that. What would you say is that you know clearly is the scope of your stewardship. What does he expect out you rather than just taking care of patients because you have a slightly different type of arrangement?
00:30:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So he wants me to basically wear different hats. Yeah. That's why the first two out of the three is with him with his medical group. So the first one, like I said, is the main main job, seeing patients in the hospital and clinic and calling patients is telehealth. That's the main job. And I get paid per patient on that one. Now provided he gave me a doctorate that's all great. So he's very generous on that one. The second part where the lean personal injury cases is where Mark kind of negotiated with me through him and with him with Dr. E that I get half, I get the percent of every patient seen. each visit. So let's say if it's a 500, each visit, I get 250. And every procedure that that patient does, epidurals, or any procedure at all, I get 20% because it's a patient or it's a client that comes from our sources, our meaning marketing, like our sources. But he has his own as well. He has his own personal injury cases as well, but he wants me to basically take over that as well. So, so he wants to urge that, but separate, merge, separate.
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask some questions though, because then my brain gets kind of stuck on logistics and then I can't really process anything else because I just like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? so who pushed back and said, you, you have to see patients in person first.
00:32:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What was the role of that person. So he he's one of basically second to the manager.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:06 - mark sweet
So like Cheryl.
00:32:08 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, that is the one who says because I didn't text Cheryl because it's still early. I know she hasn't gone to the office, but I should have texted Cheryl.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, your channel command is a little interesting. That's what I want to hear about.
00:32:26 - mark sweet
So the easiest way to make an analogy is Dr. E is me and Cheryl is married.
00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:32:35 - mark sweet
That's the easiest way.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but who did you talk to that told you no?
00:32:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She didn't. She didn't really said no.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kind of like who tried to say no.
00:32:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Reminder that, hey, you know, typically we see the patient in the clinic. She's led. The her name is led. So who's second to Mary Han? Is that Michelle? Yeah. so you know I think maybe again because I'm that person who tried to not bother people that much that's not your job it was nine o'clock ten o'clock and I know that Cheryl the manager doesn't really come then till one because she's a afternoon late type of person she works till 12 one to you know she's a she's that person so I try to be I guess consider let me let me just clarify mm-hmm you can either be the person that Dr. E wants to run things efficiently and make the money or you can be the person that doesn't bother people you can't be right and I email them at 10 a.m. say I have an incoming patient please schedule the telehealth under Dr. E so telehealth there's no specific time needed as long as it's on the list, I can click on it and chart on it. They can schedule at 3 a.m. doesn't matter. But comes 12 o'clock two hours later, it's still not added. And the call is scheduled at 12.30. So I just wanted to ask, can you add the patient? Because I don't know how to, it's on the back end. It's on their end to add the patient on the list. So that's the time when I text because I know she's there in the office already. So that's why that's the whole dynamic on that part. next time, I'll just text Cheryl right away.
00:34:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So something that would be really helpful for me is to be able to see kind of an org chart. Mark, maybe you can help with this. So I can understand what the hierarchy is and roles and responsibilities in relationship to and I will be able to understand your dynamic much faster.
00:34:59 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. It's really I mean, I talked her multiple times. She is approachable and not really at the same time. I don't know if it's just me feeling inept and, you know, not confident yet because I don't know the whole situation. I don't know the process that they have. still learning all through it, so it's possible that that's, you know, but I sent an email. I sent an email. I have that communication, but I guess, you know, email is not as urgent as text or call, so.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that would be the other thing too, is just learning the chain of command and also the pace. You need things done and learning what gets you, what results, then just kind of observing what are the bottlenecks. if you need something done and it takes x amount of time, then maybe it only takes x amount of time If this person doesn't, and maybe it takes this amount of time, if this person does it, all the details about how things operate, how things operate individually by specific people, as well as by task. So if you have the most money-making opportunity, as well as the ability to feel confident in your own skin and in your role, the more you understand about the organization, even if you're not responsible for managing it, the more that you understand it, the more you will understand how you can, again, even if you're not technically responsible for it, you can have influence over it to make it go a better way for you.
00:36:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. I just know that Tuesday night, when I talk to Cheryl, the manager who wants to be on the loop for everything, you know, medical to the practice, which of course, she's a manager. And she's very clear that she told me she doesn't want to take another project, which is aka me, because she has a contract that's coming, they have a contract that's coming. There's 300,000 patients rolling in soon.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:37:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So she's overwhelmed with that. And they don't have the manpower to like deal with that. And that's up in the air. I mean, it's not up in the air. It's just it's like an upcoming storm that they have to, you know, ready themselves, ready ourselves, because I will have to see those patients too. But then when he talked to Marc, she talked to Marc, I was there for a while. Marc, her tone change, because you know, Marc is very good in talking to people. And you know, Marc is, how can I help you? How can I make it better? You know, I'll float this.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think this is a woman that doesn't like working with other women because there are plenty of those.
00:38:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not sure. I think it's just a power issue that she wants to be in, know, wants to be on the loop. What do you think, hun?
00:38:12 - mark sweet
I don't know. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is their structure doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah. pulling in different directions. It's a very, very classic visionary and integrator situation where it's visionary. Listen to me, know, listen to me. This is how we actually do it. And frustration that obviously boils over between the two, just somewhat naturally, if you use the word naturally, but you know what I mean. so the issue for Chona is she's got to kind of navigate a tight rope. Sorry, not tight line. Tight rope between these two different people who are pulling her in different directions, partially because her, the CEO doesn't deal with anything financial. So she really doesn't have any visibility in terms of payroll or who's getting paid what or what happens. That's all Dr. E, which makes all this even more confusing because we're just trying to suppose to go to. she's trying to serve two masters at the same time without taking any one off. My advice would just be have a group chat with both E and Cheryl, that way everyone's on the same page and sees the exact same thing, so there's no issue or problem, or E, Cheryl and Cass or whatever it is while we're getting to figure this out, because I can promise you whatever they're doing now is not going be what you're going to be doing in six months. Because there is no structure, and so he's looking at us to come in and help those structure put processes in place, but we can't just go and do that rough shot because Cheryl is really upset. So we have to involve her in the process, slowly make the tweaks so she can see how much better everything is. E starts seeing some money come through, so he's happy and then the process evolves.
00:39:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
But I just remember when we talked to her.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that we're not doing it right now and then now here comes a patient today so I don't know if she's not happy about that you know this this is a thing like I think like I like oh my god and she's probably not happy with this but it's only one patient so it's fine it'll be okay the biggest issue and this is always been my experience and I know Tina will talk about this when an integrator doesn't feel like they're involved and they're on the outside that's when they get really upset so this goes back to I'm gonna I'm gonna take this here Jonah because the fastest path path to liaising between those two roles when you're not even that is structure understanding the structure so I get that you don't have all the numbers but what you're going to want to do and mark you help figure out how we can do this as best as possible and it's probably conversation with Cheryl and with Dr. E and my Maybe with you. I don't know how how this dynamic works. This is you, but hold on, but so Somebody needs to frame and and chona you're new to this. So if this is not necessarily I'm saying do this right away. Okay, I'm talking about this will be the game plan and it will be understanding as much as you can about the system and how it operates what is fluid and what is friction. What that does in terms of revenue, right? Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the bottlenecks in terms of getting something accomplished in a timely manner and having consistent patients coming in and revenue and then also how is this stopping all of these things. if you are going to come in and make the most value, you would have to understand everything about the organization. That's going to take time, especially if you're not in a position where anybody would expect you to ask those questions and even when you're expected to ask those questions, in case in point somebody I'm talking to on the other side, the sign right here is they don't always want to have give you the information or they don't have it or don't know where to go get it or it's a pain. But to make the most change with the least amount of friction and problems with the least amount of disruption to the current piece, you're gonna want to understand the ins and outs of everything and everyone as best as you can. So whatever you can do to understand that asking questions, taking notes and then bringing it back here, bringing it back to Mark hopefully with the three of us, then we'll start to get some insight into, okay so for example when I'm working with people, the first thing I want to do is make their lives easier. So you would want to not just make Dr. E's life easier, that's but you were hired for it, but you want to make Cheryl's life easier and you need to understand what bothers her, what stresses her out from a position of, that's my goal, Cheryl, how can I serve you?
00:43:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
what can I do to help you?
00:43:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. then when she gives you a little bit of information, if you have formulated a follow up question, ask the follow up question. And if she's not approachable, then just say, Hey, is there a time when I can ask you some questions?
00:43:28 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
just really want to understand this because knowing that you run all of this, I feel like the best way for me to support him is to support you.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that would be sincere. That would be the truth that that's that's her role in dynamic. And eventually, if you do it really well, and she doesn't feel threatened or anything by that, then you can have number one, a good ally that is just enjoyable to work with, but to actually getting good results. Right. you're new, there's a lot to navigate, but the fastest way to navigate it safely is to figure out the topography ASAP.
00:44:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right, so that's why I've been spending, because I know she's an afternoon night person, I would spend some time doing four hours with her, just talking, we talk about a lot of things, we talk about our dog, we talk about like, I'm trying to understand, you I wanted to understand her as a person, and I wanted to understand. It marked, you know, he talked to you too, and right? Yeah, and she helped with something. She asked me, because I asked questions, and I wanted to learn, and that's what I did the other the past couple of times, I've been seeing hers, like I wanted to understand not just the lean part, but the main job part, where in, you know, I can, I'm sure I will have more questions. It's what I told her, but I'm kind of like cementing that relationship between the two of us, because she is going to be that person, guys.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So if you capture any of that in email or text, I would love you to share that here so I can help you. But maybe if she's open to it, if you're having a conversation, say, do you mind if I just record this so I can go take some notes on it later? You probably.
00:45:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Probably know.
00:45:36 - mark sweet
Knowing how she is, she probably won't respond well to that.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, And she's super paranoid about all of this stuff. Yeah.
00:45:45 - mark sweet
What they do like is a lot of Medicare and grievances and all sorts of other things. Okay. So I totally get what you're saying, because you just don't want to have to try to remember things and write it down later.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you take notes while you're talking?
00:45:58 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Right. I can already.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to take notes on what she told me about specifically on the number two, the lean patients that do. the thing you want to keep in mind is that as you're learning everything, your ability to manage and remember it all perfectly is probably not going to be great. When you capture it, then we can start to kind of categorize the data and formulate what you want to do with it, but being able to see it visually, taking it out of your brain first of all makes it accessible to us. Right. That we can help you. But second of all, it helps you sift through instead of having to, wait, what did she say about this? That's mental effort. That's exhausting when you add that to a 10 hour day, nine hour day, whatever is on top of that. Now you're trying to go be strategic after hours. The more that you write down and organize that data, the less your brain has to work. You've already got a lot. to do. So you want to manage your mental resources and your energy resources. So getting copious notes or at least very well organized main thoughts, you know, captured.
00:47:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So yeah, I mean, I can tell you what she told me based on the what they do because I asked her what did they come in from different sources, right? They have a big one, which is the now, Dr. Gannal Manau Gannam, but it's a big chiropractor group that brings them patients. So the moment it comes in, they create an email chain between cast, share deal, Dr. E, they put the patient's name there and the birthday. And then they will say this is a new referral from this attorney's office, and these are the medical records, please, you know, schedule the patient. And once the patient is seen, by that time, hopefully, we had the MRI because we're supposed to be this specialist. So they should have gone through the conservative therapy of chiropractic treatment and or physical therapy. So they have an MRI. So by the time we see them, they said that that's the decision-making of let's do an epidural or not. We can recommend a procedure, however, we can't do it right away until we okay it with the lawyers. So what they do is they email the law firm. So this is the other steps, like email the law firm telling, attaching the notes, which Mark said it's a no-no, but anyways, I'm telling you how they do it. And then they will respond either the lawyer, the case manager of the case, will respond says go ahead. you can do the the drill. So once that's done and they schedule the patient for an epidural or for any procedure, which emailing notes like that is not HIPAA compliant, right? Right, that's how they do it.
00:49:16 - mark sweet
It's not HIPAA compliant, it's discoverable in litigation, so it looks at the lawyers driving the care, so there's a lot of things that are right.
00:49:24 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is I'm telling you like what they do and how they do it.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was just okay, that's good to know.
00:49:30 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is how they do it right now.
00:49:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that does though is it speaks to priorities and it also speaks to business understanding and just overall health of it and so that's what I'm curious about is we do it because we do it because this is how we do it. We do it because it's easier and faster to do it that way.
00:49:56 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, I need to do it that way, but yeah, you're paper trail, which Mark talked to them. That's not, you know, that's not, that's how it should not be done.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, so that's how they do it.
00:50:09 - mark sweet
Sorry, can we just talk about this just a teeny teeny bit more. So part of the issue that they have and why they want paper trail is some of the loaders they work with are not great to put it mildly. so Bill, the loaders say, yeah, do it, do it, do it, whatever that is, whether it's injections or surgery or what have you, but there's not enough money to get that done. And then at the end, they will say, well, no, we didn't mean that we don't have enough money in this way. In Cheryl's eyes, hey, we have a paper chair, we said, do it. This is your problem. You better cut your feed to make sure I'm paid because you said do it. So I understand why she wants to say it's not like she's just trying to be lazy or problematic. Like there's a very valid reason for it.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, is it solvable by having a secure portal? It's just that email cannot be secure. So it's not the communication itself that is illegal or unethical, right?
00:51:12 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, this is the issue because if you're sending to the lawyer saying I need your authorization, that makes it look like the lawyer is trying care and that's why it's bad.
00:51:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, let me just understand this real quick. The lawyer is going to say yes in policy limits, right? Right. Okay, so can we not make this correct by talking to the insurance companies and knowing what the limits are or getting those those limits like having the lawyer send a report on here's what's available left like is what is the way can't do this because two reasons one the insurance company doesn't tell you.
00:52:01 - mark sweet
Two, if that was sent to the doctor's office, then it would look like the doctor's office is only treating based on insurance, not over what the patient actually needs. I understand these are all things with stupid distinctions because the reality is what happens is the doctor will just call our office and ask, hey, do I have authority to do this, that, or the other thing? because it's a telephone call, it's not discoverable.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:52:24 - mark sweet
Okay. So it's, it just is what it is. I, I, I'm just trying to understand it all, really.
00:52:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Question.
00:52:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's possible then that we can just have internally among us, like I spoke with, oh, that's discoverable too.
00:52:41 - mark sweet
Like I spoke. it's all discoverable to some level.
00:52:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, not see seeing the lawyer, not sending them anything, but whoever called that lawyer will have our own discussion, our own email chain saying this attorney, okay, to do this procedure for this.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
So when you get subpoenaed in litigation, they ask you for your entire medical record. If that is part of the medical record, you turn it over. So it's part of your medical records.
00:53:13 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Email is part of medical records, no.
00:53:19 - mark sweet
Email communications are part of your records.
00:53:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. not the records, yes. So I don't know then, how would we have a trail?
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you can do is you could, and I might be wrong, but I'm looking for this. if the process is called the attorney and get permission, then what you can have is some way of selecting or just saying we don't write this thing down until we have that conversation. So if we've written this down, that means we've already contacted the attorneys and they've approved it. And one thing could be, Dr. recommends X. I'm conferring with patient or whatever and really what that means is I'm calling the attorney to find out if that can happen Attorney said yes.
00:54:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So patient is scheduled so how is the documentation is being done now is that We recommend patient will benefit from this and this Injection costing we say approximation of the cost And you know how many treatments needed or and or if it fails, you know This other procedure can be done with quotation of the quotes and it marks that it's okay to put that on the medical records So like something that you could do is that you put that And then maybe there's an indicator that somebody acknowledge it and is working on it and it could just be as simple as Noted receive something like that that internally.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody knows that doesn't go there until you've reached out to the attorney If the attorney says yes, you can do it then the next notation is Scheduling um or recommendation accepted and then you schedule it. So the language is not decipherable by anybody that I called an attorney and got permission. You just know that that happened. There's no record of it. But internally you would have to know don't do this until that.
00:55:19 - mark sweet
Cheryl's concern and it's a valid concern is it's great we have a phone call.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the proof? Yeah yeah yeah.
00:55:26 - mark sweet
And that's going to be a problem. So they may decide that they would rather just run the risk of looking like idiots in litigation.
00:55:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's straight off. You have to pick a off. Yeah.
00:55:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Which what they've been doing in the practice they've been doing it for a while now. They actually have a lot of their own lean patients. This is how they've always done it. And now I'm learning through Dr. through Mark that this is not the right way to do it. Now I'm coming in trying to change the structure while Oh, not in the guys, but it's the truth is to make it more efficient and kind of offload that pressure from Cheryl as well. So that's where I'm coming in.
00:56:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah. So the questions that I would be asking are, what is the most expensive? So if you get litigated, somebody suges you because that's what happened. Number one, the company has insurance that can help with that. So what is the potential risk and what is the likelihood of that? Not that anybody knows that I'm for sure, but you could ballpark it.
00:56:34 - mark sweet
So it's not them getting sued so much. It's when you have a car accident case, right, between Mr. and Mr. Jones. And so Mr. Jones's attorney's only job is to make Mr. look like he's not really hurt that all this should have been resolved very quickly and chiropractic care would have resolved. And that Mr. Smith's attorneys are the ones who are driving this because Mr. Jones has a large. policy. He didn't really need these injections and surgery and everything else. And then so when defense counsel of Mr. has emails showing that Mr. doctor asked for the lawyers' permission to do a medical procedure, it falls into the defense's narrative of they didn't really need this. They're just doing this for the money. So my question is, but it's more difficult.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my question is, what is more detrimental to the business? Having attorneys not paid for something that they authorized, so this is frequency and amount, how much is that up to or the cost of litigation for such a scenario is that? Which one gets more expensive?
00:57:48 - mark sweet
My guess is going to be it's more expensive by not having a paper trail because the attorney is that he works with it.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then that's why. the systems in place and they're making an educated risk or at least a intentional, like, conscious risk. But- That's right. That's frustrating as that is. Yes, but I mean, but that's business, you have to make trade-offs. So, and if it's the nature of it, and that's what's more expensive to them, or potentially risky. So, will Chona bear any, could she bear any liability personally for any of that?
00:58:33 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, because everything's being signed by- Okay.
00:58:38 - mark sweet
So, it's not going to be tied to her per se unless there was some sort of investigation or the FBI came and raided it.
00:58:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's not compliant. We know it. doing it anyway. All right, so we'll move on past that topic, yeah?
00:58:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:58:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, probably- prep so it's late and I will have to find a quick wrapping up thing so I gotta take my daughter again this is in the beginning there's just a lot of discovery and figuring out I would love okay let me think about if I were gonna have you read one of those books first which one it would be the 48 laws of power okay um it's it's dense but I think once you start getting into it you'll see what I'm talking about about the application and the second one would be switch um but I do think that you would enjoy some of the other ones and I'll all write them down but we've got a lot going on so yeah maybe she right now is trying to figure out how to navigate some of these interpersonal issues that's why I'm recommending these two books have you read 48 laws of power mark yes please
01:00:07 - mark sweet
I'm sorry.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't hear anything you would say. Have you read the book 48 laws of power?
01:00:12 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. that's what I'm recommending that she read even though it's dense because understanding that dynamic and all the different people. I just think it's a good book overall. But I know what I was explaining to her is watching how you might notice some people applying particular types of tactics and be able to recognize and identify specific behaviors and mannerisms and know who you're dealing with a little bit better because you'll recognize those patterns anyway. Okay, as well as how to navigate it. But also just some insight into like what to pay attention to and kind of choose your strategy for how you want to insight change as well. as how you communicate your reasons and logic behind the change that you want to make. So it's all strategy but the on a personal note and just being able to enjoy the place that you work understanding people, understanding how to serve them while understanding their motives, understanding how you can help them accomplish their motives as long as they're good. you know and be of support of those around you and knowing that all of that enables you to serve two main missions which is helping the client, patient, get what they need but also having your own success, personal success in leadership but also monetarily so you can earn that money which allows you to do whatever other things that you want by your life. So it's um It's not a fast, simple thing. really have to be conscious, mentally. The more notes that you take, like I said with everything, just even thoughts that you might have.
01:02:11 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
you gave me that voice message today, and I transcribed it and put it in my notes so that I could save it for later.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that in the future because everything that you notice is probably useful and it just kind of helps you get your bearings. Like I said, topography. Once you understand where you're at and who you're dealing with, then you can understand how to navigate it better.
01:02:36 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)

Hey!
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey! so sweet.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You look great. Your hair is perfect. Were you doing videos?
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. This normally what I do. I've just been really exhausted and seminary has disrupted my routine.
00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it, got it. I'm smoking.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wall-stinging. So dry. Let's talk. Oh, I got, I got a new, you can't see it. Mike. Nope. Oh, because of the virtual background.
00:00:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I playing with backgrounds. Oh, nice. Nice, nice, Do you, I got back to everyone. I'm going to follow up the personalized room as well.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mappier commented as well. Do you know him? I know of him. Look, it's a road up. I don't know how good it sounds. it's Yeah. So, It's $100 like the Yeti mic and but it sounds way better. It sounds as good as the Shure SMB 7 or something like that. Yeah, I know I've heard good news. Yeah, but it's USB, not XLR and it doesn't need any and it can plug into your phone and it doesn't need anything.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No cloudlifter not phone to yeah.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I mean, I like technology. I play around with a lot of things and because one of the things that I want to do is create some recordings that are like, you know, I was talking about some of the like inspirational, but also specifically calming, soothing to get frustrated. sometimes you hear something good that is specifically engineered towards getting us the energy that we want to have in business. Anyway, I think sound quality is important. So. but also I like shopping sometimes. Only online, not in person, do not like in-person shopping. I don't generally like shopping in general, but I do like the new technology thing that I would share that. Okay, so Neil, what I know about him is I got some of his stuff. He does like war reform products and...
00:02:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, I was just checking out his page. Looks like he's got a pretty slick thing for shorts and stuff. But yeah, I think he would be... I don't know that well, but I imagine it'd be a really good client too. think a lot of these people... Yeah, they need the combo. They need the combo. I think it's unique. I think we've hit something and then I think we should also create some kind of low ticket offer that leads into this for them as well.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who leads into it? Yeah, because I was thinking yesterday about how do we serve people who can't afford this, aren't ready for it. don't know if you heard it. And I thought I left it in the message, but I'm pretty sleepy. So I was saying that it was around the Cory Michelle thing, too.
00:03:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking, I think I did here, yeah, after that.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I was like, there are going to be some people who are not ready for the investment. Oh, OK, it was when, because you were talking about 5,000 or 6,000. And I was saying, I think it should be 6,000. And I don't think that we should do less and that it's more about that price will match for the person who's ready for it. Like, this is really targeting a specific type of person. I put the requirements in the document. And that $6,000 should be fine for that person. Now, some people, especially that are already on your list, are or you're going to want to serve them and help them. And so the tendency is, like you were talking about that lady who had a sliding scale. I'm like, sliding scale will modify the offer, so we won't modify the price. So the offer can change, which changes the price, right? So you get a different version. It isn't one-on-one, but what you could have is maybe just the plan, like that it's more generic, and how we would come about the plan. So here's how we would come about the plan. We would ask you all of these questions, and we would look at all of the things that you have. And here's some examples of how we would package things together, right? you can apply this logic to whatever offerings you have. And then this is the business plan, and this is the logic that we use to come up with this business plan. So you can kind of formulate your own based off of what we did as examples. Now, if you want to say, hey, Here's what I came up with is this is a good idea and have vox or access to us. Here is our $200 a month coaching or $400 month code, like whatever the vox or access would be. Yeah. And then, you know, maybe a call a week or two calls a month where you can come in and you could get like hot seat reviews, that type of thing.
00:05:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Um, so it's okay.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way cheaper. And it's along the same line. So we're staying in our lane, right? And which means that we'll get the testimonials and the referrals that we get will all be concentrated around the offer that we have, which, so all the traction, all the energy that we get, it will all be relative, which means that, that anybody coming to us should be hot and targeted, right?
00:05:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that idea. Like I was just going to say, that's sort of a little bit like, um, what do you call it? Alan Sotanic, what I pay 500 a month for, once a week he does a call, he's got the forum, right? But he doesn't do chat support or voxer support, but he's sort of in discord answering some people everywhere as well. And then on his three, four hour calls on Thursdays, you could ask a question. Um, so, so I do like that concept of what you're talking about, like you're thinking, because these people are excited and they don't, um, you call it qualify.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what else can we give them? Is that kind of where?
00:06:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you what I like about this court is you can do audio recordings and replies and video recording and replies. then it's a, it's a chat and generally the people that are in discord are either active or they're completely negative not which is there's not a bunch of just but they're coming there for a purpose so they're either talking to each other or they're completely out of it because they don't like it and they only go in for you send them email here's the content so this is another option and thing to be because of the clips specifically the audio interaction.
00:07:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well yeah and what's interesting so you know is the discord what Alan does on his $20,000 mess run that I joined last year he will do a loom video for the feedback and he'll just give you the loom link so that's kind of cool as well.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and I would totally be willing to do that too but I don't want to do that for like a $200 offer of 400 or 500 would yeah so what are we really talking about them because like for me and I can just
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
open up Google and we can just start writing because the auditory I won't remember but if I open up Google Doc. So, well actually why don't we do a customer map? What's your customer map? File, we'll make a copy in our position. So, so technically we have like let's just call it high ticket, right? Right? Technically we have this one for the pocket CMO, right?
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me zoom in bigger. Want me to share this with you as well right now or do I want to wait? That would be great but I'm good with watching you while we do this though.
00:09:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said in the Google background, if you saw that change to 12K in 2025. I love that. Yeah, six people.
00:09:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we have to back that up and do that, and then I think that we could change the 12K also to 12 months and maybe also put in like a call once a quarter or something like that so that the value is stacked a little bit more.
00:09:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so what you're saying, so repeat kind of what you're thinking here, I was thinking like a full on low ticket funnel, but you were saying something else. It's like a lower fee subscription.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was saying, like, and I wouldn't really want to offer this until after we've done a couple of these because it would give us the framework to make that so much easier. But basically, they would get the same thing, but it would be a do-it-yourself version. So here is because what we're going to do is we're going to take a survey form that is thorough. It's basically an intake form that gets all this information from people. And from that intake form, we're going to figure out all the assets that they have and the skills and abilities that they have and formulate an offer stack for them, right? Front and like a low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, if possible, and different types of offers and packaging that they can give and not necessarily that they should offer all of them, giving them some options. and showing them how they could package their products slash services differently. And in order to just have something, first of all, that's scalable, potentially. So potentially low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, potentially something that is recurring, but it really depends on who they are and what they're offering. That doesn't work for everybody. But that's what we'll be looking at is what is the best way to leverage, whatever is that you have to offer to people. And then, do you want me to finish the?
00:11:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Try and thought, yeah, yeah.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so are you talking about what is the low ticket? So then the other thing would be we're going to create a business plan and say, here's the strategy that we would go about for you to make sure that you're not overextending yourself, like minimum viable product, really laser-targeted marketing using existing organic traffic. them. Coming up with the most leveraged business plan that they could have to mitigate loss and maximize profits. So that is very custom. That's what we're offering to people who's going to be talking to us one on one, which is a little bit more detail than I've given in the past, but since we've talked about this. But what this front end version could be is like here's examples of what we've done. We're not doing this for you, but we're going to show you our logic and we're going to give you these case studies or examples, right? So that you can put your own stuff through it and come up with a plan on your own and try to apply what was done because you can't afford it, or whatever reason, just choose not to invest in us on a higher level. But if you want support doing that, if you want some feedback, if you want to be able to get some help with it. And again, still don't want to pay the $6,000 price, then you can join our monthly group and you can quit anytime you want to. There's no commitment. So let's just say you want to come in and ask a bunch of questions. Then you get access to us for $400 a month. You can ask questions. You can, we'll have two live calls a month and it can be a couple hours long and bring your stuff, ask your questions. So that's still so it could be the front end is here's how we did it. Here's the framework, $97. The next upsell was if you want support while you came up with it, if you want feedback on your plan, if you want us to look at it and see how we would tweak it, adjust it, then you can come into the membership group for whatever $400 a month. And we'll give you feedback and if we're giving good feedback and it's going to take you what a launch that I imagine you're going to save for a few months, right? That's not enough you want to get there faster and you want us to really plan it out if you want access to a roll of X and who we would hire for this type of thing then it's the $6,000 one.
00:14:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I still can't visualize picture of the front end same thing but do it yourself version. Here's how we did it.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's how you can model it. So you won't probably until we've done it for somebody and I was just about to say maybe we need to run through the client stuff and you know see most of you all but so yeah it'll look kind of. kind of like our calculators. like you've got the the funnels like right you've got that. So they would be able to get one of those and plug their stuff into it. I have a different version of things and we would have an outline of maybe it's a Trello board like a project suite that says because we can share Trello boards people can copy them and this would be stage one stage two stage three kind of thing or maybe copy just graphics development all the different moving pieces and create them into tasks that they would then you know modify but they at least have a framework and we could put etas of how long this type of task should be should take to do so really break down the whole cycle into actual task and in actual project management suite that they just import and so let's say they get a developer they just assign those tasks to their developer and maybe instead of school they're using circle or Facebook groups or whatever so they modify a couple of things but for the most part it's gonna be pretty duplicatable. I think that's super high value and I'd be okay with giving that away for $97 because I think we want to over-deliver below them away with everything that we do and basically prove like how much we know and understand and how valuable we are so because at some point they're gonna go this takes way too long even with all the amazing tools that we give them they're like I want more help and that's that's what we want is we want them to be sold on how helpful we are so that we're not trying to you know we don't have to work for sales calls they should basically be begging to work with us because they know what we know, they know where they answer and they're happy to give us their money. It completely changes the energy and the dynamic of their relationship versus when you go in like and somebody hires you and they're like okay prove to me you're worth my money.
00:17:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah yeah so yeah like we had like for my car for magic we have like I'm just going to share screen or show this we had a product called high ticket toolkit as well and it had like yeah four calculators crush your launch creating proper headache offers easy but and then we had a whole excel or csv so where they could just import into a sauna and have like all the tasks they have to do like
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I actually have a base camp project template that I use for my freedoms, huh?
00:18:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:18:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I used to use for my freedom systems and if I, let me see if I can find it in my drive, I use a new project template, let me share screen with you for a second, is that okay? So this actually came from, this came from starting with building Ryan Moran's Shear Strength Labs, the 12 months to a million bucks you wrote. So, um, Well, let's see, project discovery, that's a whole new thing, right, is kind of defining the avatar. These are, these would be tasks that you start with, conversations that have to be had, meetings, exploration on the team. Like, it depends on who you're at, but if you're doing this for your, as your agent agency, then you're doing it for a client and you're doing it with them. So, and the note is here, remove any items that are not applicable to the funnel, but what we'll do is have it where it's, you know, project suite specific and just be able to export from one to another. But these things, right, define what it is, title was the price, who's responsible for creating the content. So, like, if the copywriter has one part, the graphic designer has another part, that type of thing. sometimes before you even get to the copywriter, you have to give. of product-specific information, so then it's kind of three part, right, because it's the product owner who has to inform the copywriter, and then the graphic designer should be entitled what they want, and generally the copywriter probably is going to inform that if they're really good at marketing and you're hiring a copywriter. Due date, stages, dependency tasks, things like that. Yeah. core offer up sales, that admin instruction tasks, labeling base camp tasks properly, creating client project folder and Google Drive, creating the following sub-folders, all these things for approvals.
00:20:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot. So you can like make some like this, but in Trello, so it looks really pretty, people go all about it from a marketing perspective?
00:20:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And also, this could be a PDF that is broken down a little bit more and explained a little bit more, dressed up and made pretty. um, um, explain with some videos, like this could be a product all in and of itself. Um, I was going in a totally different direction.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going more, um, the front end, like a true low ticket funnel, like more about the end result, getting them on, whether it be go high level or system I owe, so that they become a customer that way. Like, so, so for instance, like, the thing could be a 37 or $27 in $14, like a lot of Alan's tannic students are making, you know, multi-million dollar low ticket files and they're using a $14.40 price. But I could be, we have to figure out who our avatar is on this one, but like, so for instance, it could be just one around, um, you know, here's like, just to get them hooked is that, you know, here's like, whatever, five years of winning Facebook ad formulas and actual ads that have helped me build to million dollar funnels. You could have this and even if it's five bucks, right? And then when they get that, say, you know, the thing that made it work, though, is a really good funnel software as well, besides the copy and everything. And so the next page, bump can be like, get all of our snapshots or templates, you know, here's some examples of some winning, you know, know, pages. I mean, that's what Anac Sentinel did. Like he at low ticket funnels. He's not the expert at it, but he just claimed ourselves a frickin' expert because he saw all the money in being a go-high level affiliate, right? So he bolted on front end to make a boatload of money on it. Like, there's sort of a joker down to 10x thing going. This guy never even made a million off of a lot things in funnel. Now he's like, but he's doing it. He's getting away with it. And of course, he's a great guy. He sells other stuff about information products. That's good. But uh, but anyways, so I was going around that angle, like, yeah.
00:22:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You made me think of something now. So that's type of organization, that is what I've inserted into every company that has become a million dollar company that wasn't before I got there.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So how do we, and I'm not going to have the answer right now, and maybe you haven't, but how do you make that ? Because when I looked at it, my eyes glossed over little bit because I'm creative, right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results are what ?
00:23:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The work is not .
00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a saying that says something um, looks like work and dressed like overall success, something like that is success. Looks like work, dressed in overalls. I don't remember what it is. Hold on a second. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I love that quote.
00:23:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing is I am not going to if you like sucking your thumb, we are not going to work.
00:24:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
part together, right? If you're looking for passification, if you, I'm an I am a fast twitch explosive kind of person.
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot sit still for long. If you're and now I am also like, I used to think I was lazy because I was always looking for the shortcuts. I'm not lazy, but I get bored easily. And I want to do lots of things. And I want to feel that explosive energy. So I gamify everything. There is no faster, easier way to do and to grow than what I've created. Because if there were, I wouldn't go into companies and have their mind blown every time. just that is why it's a fundamental like a lever is the most basic kind of tool you have a fulcrum. like a rock and a plank and the lifting power is exponential based on the size of the lever. It is as simple as it gets. You still have to do the lifting. You don't have to get the pull from. You still have to get the lever. It still works. But the power that you can do once you understand the lever and you do it, is amazing. Let's imagine that this guy is like, I can't do this job because I got to hire five guys to lift this big old thing and Joe blow up over here and he's tiny. like, I got you $25 and he brings out a rock and a stick and he gets it done by himself. That's magical. He's blowing the mind of these early dudes and five of them do it and it was so much more expensive. That is the power of working smarter or harder. Everybody tells you to do it. Nobody tells you how to do it. This is how how you do it. So it isn't . The work isn't . The results are . So, you know, you have to decide if you want front or back, but you don't get both.
00:26:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because if it's on the front, which means I don't do any work, you're not going to get big results.
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get big profits. You're not going to have a great company. You're not going on the front. You actually are smart and you do some of the work and you're organized and structured. Guess what you get on the back end? All this .
00:26:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And you get to keep it.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not trying to convince somebody and try to sell them and let them hear what they want to hear. If you want to go buy a diet pill instead of go to the gym, I'm not a person. If you want to go buy a lottery ticket to make your money, I'm not your person. And I want to be very clear about that. Yeah. But what I will tell you is. I've got the best plan for the gym. And I literally, Maria, for real, I go to the gym, I spend about 15 minutes, I do a leg press, and I do this one movement overhead. But it works. of those movements get all of my core.
00:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm sore from head to toe. My daughter went with me, she's like, that's crazy.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My strength grows every week. I can lift more. only do it every couple of weeks. I have lost size. I don't eat less. I don't like, I'm not, you know, tiny or anything, but the power of that, and I found somebody else that explained it, but I have way less pain. I sleep better. I have more energy because I'm not exhausting myself going to the gym, building up cortisol. I still go to the gym. I'm just going to the gym way less and more powerfully than most people are doing.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's the same thing in business.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm doing. Project management like other people, but I'm precision about it and I'm getting the most out of the least every single time. So like, that's how you make it is that, you know, it is work, but it's the least amount of work that you can do to get the greatest amount of results. If you're not looking for great results, then this isn't for you.
00:28:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, so, um, yeah, and essentially because if I look at my most successful companies, there's no doubt that at the beginning stages is because whether it be me or someone else, we had a really good project management or just more than that, everything you talked about because I remember I had base camp and even for every private client then that came to me, I actually put them on base camp and they had their separate workspace just for that, you know, um, so yeah. interesting, interesting. So I'm just trying to think and train of thought. And I might just have a bias that I need to remove. You know, the famous guy wrote the book Pay Yourself First, Profit First.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that guy?
00:29:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Profit First, yes. He was a client. Yeah, he was a client of Emily Hershey's and there was another very famous guy like that in that same area too. Like a lot about like a little bit about what you're talking about too. And we never could get ads to work for them. Like it just wasn't at the beginning that to teach them that. lot of people were like, yeah, but I get it. So yeah, it's just not coming to me with that front end would be though what we call it and all that. But you're right.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe we just
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
need to do it a couple of times for some clients first.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, we could call it a profit accelerator. It could be a business accelerator because accelerating is what it is, but it's also sustainable growth. So this is one of the biggest reasons I haven't created stuff because coming up with a hook is hard. That's where the longevity and the long play comes in, right? So people who are already familiar who just know, like this off, when you did a pocket CMO and COO, that created an immediate, there was an image that they could draw. They know what a CMO is, they know what a pocket is. They can imagine, I've got access, OK, that's actually really clear while still being incredibly ambiguous. Yeah, yeah. But they drew the picture in their own mind. So, using language that allows a person to fill in the blanks and draw the picture in their own mind is what we want to do, right? So, we want to allow them to draw the conclusions like, that's why we have words like blueprints and toolkits and accelerator that have been used in IM for, the beginning, blueprints gives you an instant thing, like, you know, like, that is the schematics, that is the line, that is everything top to bottom, you know, you like, I got to get work done, that's the thing, accelerator, all of these types of things, they, know what they mean, even if we don't know exactly the way that they would apply to work, and we don't even know that the person that's selling it actually.
00:32:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
actually has anything good.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it a good toolbox or did you step from the dollar store? Like, you know, the power and the results are different. Is it a good blueprint or did you have a really bad architect and there are things missing and the measurements are off? assume that everything with those words are good. Yeah, that's what they were created for, but it doesn't. And so the value is a tied to that particular word less so than the actual product that's being sold.
00:32:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It does.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It does. can find that type of word for any of these offers that conjures up an image in a person's mind of the power. And by the way, it's a leverage power. So the leverage of a blueprint is clarity. know step by step what I have to do. leverage of a toolkit is is that when I have to put a name, into the wood. I know I have to do it, but how am I going to do it? I need the right tool, right? So that implies that I'll have what I need to accomplish the work. Accelerator means that it's going to go faster than it would if I didn't get this. It's an implied leverage to each of and they automatically kind of fill in the blanks of the value.
00:33:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. There's someone just message me that I know a little bit not super well, but pretty well from another group. She was there for the program. She just messaged me. This is include implementation of the marketing plan. I said no, but if I was consulting on it, as you implement it in team to hire and more, team is behind the scenes expert behind hugely names like that of scale, like Dan Meredith, and you can pop on a comment with me and Tina if you want.
00:33:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just see what she was. But yeah, you would even say, don't know if they know him, but Ryan Moran of capitalism.com Yeah, 12 months to $1 million because I'll say that should name of capitalism.com. Yeah. He also has an event called Capcom every year. He gets Damon John. He gets lots of big people.
00:34:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's this book?
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the book called? Pretty sure it's 12 months to him. Your first year, right? that. Yep, Ryan Moran, Ryan, Daniel Moran, 12 months to $1 million. Not that he bothered acknowledging me.
00:34:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the fact that we put it in base camp.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did all of that. And I was.
00:34:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where's. She said, I don't need marketing strategy.
00:34:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's all about the integration at this point. Another word people call me is integrator When rocket fuel came out and that word came out that was like two people like you're an integrator. That's what you are Tina Is everybody likes labels?
00:35:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I Think because everyone knows me as marketing they're assuming it's marketing yet.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought the docket was pretty clear about Operations and team and stuff that is interesting Yeah, so then maybe giving a background of who I am and what I've done and that like if they've ever read Traction or rocket fuel that I am the integrator for several seven and eight-figure businesses or have been. Do I have it?
00:36:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we'll see what she says. She's been planning with me for the last three months, so I don't know if she'll pull the trigger because I don't know what she's just shopping around and cheap, I'm just gonna say that. Because then when I say playing, I mean, asking me questions too in Facebook questions or before being paid a dollar for stuff, right? but that is a perfect example where I find that fascinating. And maybe we just need to get more you and I together on video, Tina, because it is like even the product boss, how do they really get to one million? besides my marketing strategy, I had them hire an integrator as their first hire, right? You know. Oh, because, yeah, that I just like, oh, sorry.
00:37:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what Matt said, um, just to make a correlation to things that people actually can know and do some research on. So he doesn't say share certain lives, but I get results. She came into our company when we were having some growing pains and needed help cleaning up our systems. that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month. Fast forward 12 months and we've increased our revenue 10 fold. Tina played a huge part and helping us do this. Robert released. took our ideas and visions and made them a reality. And we couldn't have grown this fast without her. Okay. So Matt, this is the partner of, oh, I'm not sharing that part of my screen. Sorry, stop sharing, share. Um, really not good.
00:37:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. What I can do is in the Google doc or if you want to, you can just put in some screenshots of more people, but this is all good feedback, by the way, right? To show, Hey, here's behind the scenes of these people, right? Um, I just know, um, like even Karina, how she got to me, she got disgusted with someone else. She paid 5k for. She didn't say the name. forget was, but this is like three, four years ago. She I bought it because included in her program was a, was a business plan. I really wanted the business plan, but the girls program didn't lead with that. The girls program was probably something like the 10k a month program, like it led with something like that. But the business plan was boiler template and she was so mad. And the coaches weren't the guru. It was $25 an hour. People she had hired, you know, so she was just like, ah, so, um, anywho, uh, yeah, um, I wonder.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan's always offering to share stuff for me, but he's also doing his own thing. So I don't know. I talked to my guy too, because they're business partners. Um, My guy is who got Dan Meredith to do, to even be recognizable at all. So I'm Dan's first coach that he ever hired. And then because we worked together, I introduced him to my guy who has, you know...
00:39:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on, I'm just want to make sure that Kat's not pinging so much.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on. Okay.
00:39:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it's okay. No, I think she must have just been playing with something, but you know when Kat kind of do the scratch, scratch, before they go pee? Yeah. So that's what I was worried so no I think she must have just been trying to get a spider or something in the corner.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That we might be able to get more. for eyeballs on it from a group that is familiar with me.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what I do is what I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I also think maybe Friday, instead of a webinar and all that stuff, we're trying to figure out. Maybe it's you and I doing just a true podcast style interview. We're just talking to each other and I'll just say, Tina, why is having systems so important? And we just we have a little bit of a structure, but it's really just us talking saying, hey, we're doing this video because some of you may not know me or you, Tina, then we both share it with our audiences, something like that. Because my people, I think they're so used to me being, I'm just going to say, at low price and do stuff for them.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like remember the last offer was $2,000.
00:40:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll create the whole front end. So I think they're having sticker shock, right? eight um so potentially because she hasn't um she said send me a link and i'll and i'd love to talk to you you too this is this on a girl amanda but uh amanda who hines hines she does wholesaling she's in my laurel portay seven dollar month ads group that i'm in um and uh so uh uh i'm definitely open to it send me a link to discuss and i can match it to my availability so um yeah i think i'll just have to send her a link to when you and i are available to to talk to us but uh i i don't want to fight from the business either oh i won't yeah so so it's like you know she's already trying to position herself you know i mean um so versus like i can just put up and nothing held back now like hey five hundred dollar run out of her one hour our strategy cash injection plan with me. So just to piece, you know, for the next week for casual, but I don't want to fight for her. Like, you know, she doesn't see the value. I'm not going to, you know, yeah.
00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I didn't even do like a one-on-one call. So here's the thing. What I would say is if you want to do a call with us, first you have to fill out the form. Okay, like I told you before, you don't get to talk to me unless you're qualified to talk to me. And if you aren't, if you need to be convinced, go convince yourself or I'll find somebody else, but I don't, you're not worried about you.
00:42:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah.
00:42:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where I'm coming from is that all fairness, all these people don't know who you are, right? No, that's okay, but I'm saying for you too. Like, you don't need to be worried about them. So if they need to be sold on you, but for your time, like your one-on-one time, even... or like a sales call, look, before, because you don't want to sell somebody who's not qualified.
00:43:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, they just call it like, yeah, you know, she makes enough and all that. Yeah, yeah, because I'm in the same group, Laurel. That's why she wanted to hire me for ads because her low ticket funnel is really done well. She's done well and she sells a low ticket funnel on how to do wholesale real estate investing. And it's done really well. But she's still not the ideal perfect avatar, don't think, because the other ain't danger.
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a good conversation we're having because who we want to really help.
00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. The other day, just having someone who just started making money online and just, you know, started to have success with their funnel. So, they're going to be very, most of them, unless they've run real business before with people and stuff, they could be very, probably how you disrupt court and show. They could be very like, just like, yeah, you know what I mean? just, you know. Needy or cheap or whatever and so like you like like the perfect avatar and obviously he's a friend So he wouldn't do it right wouldn't make sense to be my friend Derby right who's run many companies He's in his early 50s or late 40s probably 50. Yeah, no, he's definitely was 50s. think but you know He's already made millions of dollars in the past. He's also lost it but he hasn't really Stuck with something he's a little bit like me So he wasted 25 grand on Russell Bronson's circle thing about two years ago Why did you buy that and then now he's struck it rich again because he's always striking rich He'll always keep trying stuff. He's making about 40,000 a month or recurring from his Airbnb He converted one of his apartment village in New Jersey It was like eight unit into Airbnb's and he's now making grants making 35 to 40 grand a from like 15 years ago doing SEO consulting for local businesses And he's still getting $500 checks from businesses from 12 years ago. So he has a funnel I created for him last year for it. And it was doing pretty good. But he got frazzled because he was trying to do everything.
00:45:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those are the perfect people that that's who needs me the most. Because I think I've experienced a little bit how quickly I can focus you. And so instead of like you, you still are thinking about other things, but you're staying in a lane and you're not letting it. So you're not doing the things at the cost of what's most important. That's generally what people do. And so I can literally just a text message, a boxer message, whatever, very short thing, get somebody anchored. So like my attorney's wife, my client who's an attorney hired me for his wife. And she is a nurse practitioner, but there's a business opportunity in community. and helping organize things and structure things. But she's never operated like this before. She is not native to America. She doesn't speak English, but it's not her native tongue. There's a lot of things that she's frustrated with, but she's very smart and she's very capable. And so she's had some issues that have kept her from doing the things that she needs to do. In simple text messages that took me five minutes to write, she shifted and shifted immediately and for the rest of the time. then so once a week I just text her, see how she's doing. She tells me the things that's stressing her out. give her a quick little, it's like an inspirational message. But it's tactical. It's like, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening. So now that you know it's happening and you're conscious of it, now you know why it's happening and you're conscious of it. Here's a strategy that should work according to what I know about your personality that you can implement. And then they get buy-in because they say... you're right, I will do X and now in a matter of minutes, something that because there was no clarity, they weren't conscious of it. They weren't clearly conscious of it. They weren't conscious of the cost to them or a tactic to stop the thing from happening. Yes, I can give that to people in minutes. So, you know, having a conversation about that, teaching people and that gets back to jeans, shorts, levels of awareness, right? What do you call that? don't know, but I know it exists and I know it can find it and I know it can be fulfilled. Yeah. Technically, I think that's what, like, so I've never called myself a business coach. Other people call me business coach. I hate it. I've said consultant, operation manager, project manager, like operations consultant, but I get called business coach.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
People just call me coach. Hey coach. Hey coach.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need that yeah, and it's because you know, it's it's strategy. It's tactics but it's also look you need to do this you need to do that and and it's not a specific thing right it's business related so if you hire a soccer coach soccer coach might tell you how to eat might tell you how to think might tell you to get to bed on time I tell you it's a homework done so you're it's not in your head might tell you all kinds of things it has nothing to do with soccer per se yeah impact your game so the same thing with business coaching is you know but there are a lot of crowd people out there and there's not a lot that can do what I do and then there might be people who like well if she's so good why is she just doing this well because my priorities mom I'm serving the mission I'm going to school I'm not out here trying to get a yacht I'm just living my life and help you along the way so that's an uphill battle because people have scripts in their head about what people look like what successful people look like and that kind of thing. So anyway, that's all the stuff that we're dealing with. But once you start to get testimonials and come up with a particular name that has that word that conjures up something, right, like blue kit and blueprint, like toolkit, things like that.
00:49:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if we get some names for that particular offer where they're like, this is what happened, this was amazing and they tell them Yeah, like really, when you think about it, and it might just be people just need more exposure as well. It's sort of a bit like the strategic coach. I think I mentioned that guy to you before. He's in Canada and like Scott Alford hires him, like a lot of people work at steel hires him. Let me see, like a lot people already making a lot of money, know, or , got to hire this guy because I don't have a life after I've, you know, done. I'm so well in my business, so let's see all these things, or if anything to Dan Sullivan, that's it, that's just a DJ coach, this guy, I mean they don't go in implement for people, like they're like, yeah, you know, Dan Sullivan, as in like the class, like the marketer and copywriter, like that's been around for decades business. He's picture of this guy.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what he looks like, but yeah, no, no, I'm sharing screen right now.
00:50:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, I still don't know what Dan Sullivan looks like. Oh, got you got you got it.
00:50:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but yeah, he's on par with Dan Kennedy and a lot of ways in terms of like how long he's been around and, and yeah, so. Business strategy is definitely a huge part of what I offer and do But I don't have a brand and I don't have you know a pedigree.
00:51:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So You're also not paying his prices. We have results. We have the results. Yeah, okay, so Other than that where were we so And that's just one person, right?
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's plenty of other people that I just said the Google Doc too So I'm interested in in talking to Neil and seeing I mean I don't know what or your forum stuff and I don't know how he organizes his business. So I Don't know enough, but I know that he knows a lot about business I know he knows a lot about the market. So if he's interested in it, I would imagine there's I Know some need not being met for him and I'd be curious what what sparked his curiosity in it.
00:51:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hmm.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the other conversations to start having is, like, raise your hand if you've heard of rocket fuel and raise your hand if you've heard of an integrator, like, has anybody looked at that go? I wish I had an integrator. Well, that's what Tina is, and that type of thing, because again, it's a correlation to something that they already have a definition for in their head, and they've already attached a value to it if they're familiar with it. So, by translation, by saying this integrator thing that you've already got, and it's established about saying she's that, and she's been doing it for these companies to go, oh, wait a minute, okay, I could have access to that, like, and Maria's standing, like, working with her, so Maria must think that that's useful and good. You could even tell any, like, if you have anything to share about anything that you feel like I brought value to you for, like, you will imagine. And we were just talking we weren't even like I didn't hire anything, but just in talking Yeah, I felt this did this and this is how I feel about it now and because not everything is going to be a like it's going to be an indirect financial game, so We had a conversation about your center and your values and I didn't say anything about Karina, but you Took what was said and you knew like this is where I'm stuck right now I'm not doing what I should be doing and I need to make a change. didn't know that I you knew that but I Facilitated a thought in your head that made that happen with clarity for you and then you went and did that and and that's the type of thing It's very difficult to explain how that happens unless you've had the experience. Yeah, yeah-hmm But you've been on fire since you let that weight go
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I know, I know, it gets down a little bit because that later I had to finish that 2K Final Four, which still burns me because she paid the 2K on Thursday and Friday and so Karina got like 1200 of the 2K and the next day Karina's like, I don't think this partnership is working, you know. I met with her today to go over her customer journey and everything, hey, this is almost done. She, so this is digital products, right, think she's going to do really well because she does well on Etsy selling some of these digital planners for co-parenting custody and productivity for months. And then she goes, well, no, I'm going to buy Karina's $5,000 one-on-one coaching site because I want to stick with, I want to also grow my e-com store because I started with her. I'm just like, oh, . She's never going to make that back. She's been with Karina for over six months and she's only broken even, you know.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I their lessons.
00:54:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
had to learn yours. That's true. theirs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I was just like, I really was shocked because, um, yeah, I, like, because she thought I could run her traffic for her for like really cheap, she goes, oh, next week we start traffic for this. So wait, that's not not in scope for the 2K, you know, and so I, I was just like, if you want that, I could still honor the traffic package I offered a while ago for, for people if it was just one campaign and managing the ad spend is $1,000 a month, which is like it should be like 3K month.
00:55:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so anyway, uh, your effective hourly rate should never be less than 500. You, Maria specifically, know, shouldn't be less than 500. So I need you to engrade that, engrain that in your head, um, because that's the result you get. So if somebody is not qualified to pay that or doesn't want to pay that, that conversation can end very quickly and it's okay.
00:55:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Well, exactly. And I think the issue has been because I've been around Crena's crowd, right? These are all people who who just barely can make paying the shop if I'm not paying You know what you should do is you should write a pedigree post.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is my history. This is who I am. This is what I've done. And for a little while I've been playing small. You don't have to say anything about it. Now this is not to say I don't believe in low ticket funnels. I do. I think that there's a lot of value in it, but because I think because I've seen them grow you know million dollar per year or whatever businesses, but I want to be very clear that I am not a low ticket person. This is the value. This is what I bring to the table. And somehow sometimes people make a correlation between the low price of an offer and the low price of time with me and let me make sure that you understand that they're not the same thing.
00:56:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that. Because it's not your results speak for themselves.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah and it's maybe or even rethink having the school group as free like I'm tempted just to put a you know whether five buck a month or 47 bucks a month on it right now because I notice it's attracting a lot of people as well that are uh do you want to do you want to turn that into something we do together we can split the school price and just start go let's go create let's start having conversations in there every week um we can have a couple every week if you want to and just go like gangbusters on learning them but them learning us because there's no way we start talking and people show up and they're not going to get that really smart I went to traffic conversions one time and Richard Linder was not a partner yet and he was teaching email stuff and I'd been managing email list for a while and I knew a lot about deliverability and sender score this was 13 years ago almost 12 years ago people didn't know this then um but I did because our emails weren't getting through and I needed to figure out why because that was costing us a lot of money and I don't like losing money. By the way, while getting paid $15 an hour to turn a company into a million dollar company and going bankrupt while getting divorced, like I got some issues. Anyway, so I kept asking questions and he's like, you're really smart, aren't you? then I walked out of that room and I could hear people pointing at me whispering about how smart I was in digital marketing. So this isn't about arrogance, it's a point like I stand out even in crowds of smart people. There are a few that I get around and I'm just like, they're their brilliance and I see that they do a lot of what I do but they're also very quiet. They're not out there doing big things like big things publicly privately. There is many like eight figures, seven, eight and nine figure businesses and they're the masterminds behind it that nobody knows about. But when you hear them talk, you know, yeah, you're like that, but you've been, you focus on the marketing so much. But when you talk about strategy, people are like, holy crap, every single time, but yeah, well, that's why Emily hers hired me to be the strategy director. Yeah, like it was I never heard of her until one of my clients hired her, but then they went back and because they undid everything she did because ultimately it didn't work for them.
00:59:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, she was I don't know if she's changed now, but back then she was pretty bad.
00:59:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was like two years ago.
00:59:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, really? Oh, well, then it's just she grew too fast and like some of the ads managers are really good. So it's maybe some bad. But yeah, for her, basically, then a strategy director, I would be helping like not helping that be crafting the strategy for Amy Porterfield, Mary Forley, I look at Gabby Burstein, those were her clients, right?
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know that.
01:00:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think she still has those clients.
01:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kept in the referral because she started. you that's, that should be part of your, like your pedigree.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seriously, Maria, just spend like the next week riding down the, the who's who, the stories, the money, the whatever. That should be a whole thing. Because the next time somebody is like, well, you know, it'd be like, hold on, go take a read down and then make it done.
01:00:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I think that's good. So, and, and then, so, yes, a member I suggested maybe we just share school group. So I think the freebie group, even though they say that's good, was like having a free Facebook group, because school, the nature of school, you're getting a lot of people who just want to spam others. We always have to keep spam. if we make it 10 bucks a month or five bucks a month, it'll keep those people out and it could become like a newsletter alternative.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or we decided. So that was one of the things I was thinking about with the community. is rather than email because you also can email, but only like once a week or three times a week, something like that. I don't remember. Once a day school, you can't. So if you do a post, you can email that out. It will send an email notification to people, but there's a limitation to three days. Okay. Yeah. So that's fine. But either way, putting out content like that, right? So rather than not instead of email, but in addition to for people who don't necessarily want email, but they like the groups and they like socializing. But yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what do you think? We could always just keep increasing it every month, maybe five bucks for this month, 10 bucks next month, 15 next month, or do you think we just go right to 27 a month?
01:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just go with the dollar. So we keep people there and then say, okay, month, and let's go just add value.
01:01:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we immediately stop the spammers because you have to put in a credit card, right? Correct. Yeah, they affiliate markers and I'm I'm pretty sure we should be able to convert a free school community into a paid Yeah, you can you can and obviously we can we can just call this digital marketing or something like we don't I again. I never claimed the URL because we could change it whatever we want so Yeah Well that guy looks good and I don't let in people they don't have Anything you know what I mean and I'm almost almost tempted to not like guys in anymore Cuz all the free onboarding calls I've had that I stopped now the good ones were with the females But the guys just said just want to pure like what about this? about this? about this here?
01:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it wasn't enjoyable the energy was different Maybe just a business acceleration because it's not just marketing. We're going to be talking about everything business acceleration strategies or Something like that
01:03:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, looks like we can do that.
01:03:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:03:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I'm making a buck right now.
01:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Five bucks, 10 bucks, whatever you feel like just. So people that don't pay it. I don't know how that works. Like, do they get to stay?
01:03:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know what happens, but. No, they all get grandfathered in.
01:03:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
01:03:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so if you do month and annually. they do five bucks a month for the year, usually five months. Five times five is 55, 55 for the year. 8%.
01:03:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just can't wait. Five times too long. Yeah, because otherwise it'd be 65.
01:03:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa.
01:03:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So instead of 55, it's not making a 40. I just want to make it five months worth. Five bucks gets seven months free. But how do I. . Oh, that's. Yeah. All right. I think it just means that these people are free and the rest have to pay five bucks, I think.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anybody else?
01:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody now? Yeah. So let's just go incognito and I have a call in five minutes. Is there anything else that you want to cover before I jump off the call?
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. So if we're going to do that together, you can make me an admin. If you want, you can build me for half of the thing. Like, let's talk about the details and whatever, how, you want to do it. We can talk about branding and strategy.
01:04:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know I'm $25 a month.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. then I think let's, let's build out a scale of like what is going to be next month and through the end of the year and just I don't know. Like, I think that would be a good plan. Oh, that's my love. I want to get him.
01:04:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, catch up.
01:04:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We'll catch up soon because he's like, oh, I love it.

> 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you there? You're muted, by the way.
00:00:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I'm here.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
Good.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. was a week then.
00:00:26 - Patrick Shahverdian
Pretty good week.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, tell me about it. Workways.
00:00:34 - Patrick Shahverdian
Got some settlements in. got a big demand expiring tomorrow. So fingers crossed. But we hit the settlement will today. It's to Lorenzo and I. He helped get a policy limits on a case that I had him second voice. So it's good.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's working. I didn't hear that. Let's see. So how come it got so close to the deadline of expiring?
00:01:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
On that one, it's, that was your worst been negotiating for like a week and a half. But the case tomorrow, it's a really big one. And on big ones, they'll typically take up to the deadline. And they're entitled to wait until the last day to respond. So I followed up last week. They said they'll get back to me. So we'll see what happens tomorrow.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing that you feel like your team dropped the ball on or anything.
00:01:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, we're obligated to give them 30 days. So they want to take the full amount and they're entitled to do that.
00:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. There's still lots of things I don't understand about the processes. So when you say expiring, I'm like, OK, so it was. Um, like, expiring meeting that they have to respond by that day. Got you. you. Hi, Lorenz.
00:02:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, how's going?
00:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. That was an awesome email update you sent.
00:02:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, well, I was over to you.
00:02:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
apologize for the delay.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all right. Uh, I thought that that would be a good jumping off point to go over in our call today together if you're okay with me sharing it.
00:02:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that's fine.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, um, just let's see. I'm trying to figure out how to do this. Um, I think the best thing to do would be. I'm going to share and I'm going put this in your notes in the bottom. Um, and. All right, so I'll do it, I think. Everybody see? Okay, so this was your monthly one of ones? Yeah. I love this. Can you tell us the structure real quick of how, like, what we're talking points?
00:03:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How did you handle your meetings? How long did they take? Okay, so yeah, as scheduled an hour, we're trying to be done in about 30 minutes. But that way if it goes over this particular issues, we have plenty of time. for them to feel like we're, you know, they're being listened to. And then the way I structure it is we go, you know, basically over, I try to ask them how they're doing, and usually they're telling some defense or about how they're happy and, you know, everything is great. It's like I try a little bit and I break it up into where the biggest stress is from, that comes from the client aspects aspect of your job. And what are the biggest stresses that come from the firm, the administration aspects of your job or the structure or whatever. And so I try to keep it pretty organic. Like I don't, you know, them an agenda in advance. tell them, you know, kind of what I want to talk about. But we kind of move through those, those things pretty organically. And then I go, once we discuss those things, it kind of segues naturally into coaching points, things that, you know, we can come up together about how they can improve, how we can address their concerns and improve their performance at the same time. And then that lead, that naturally leads into goals on things that we, I want to see them work on in the next month until the next time. All right. Good.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how, did all of these happen last week?
00:05:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, actually they happened like two weeks ago. Okay. Just really bad at, you know, finding the time to digitize all this.
00:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you, so something that you could do is just, have, use your phone as a recorder, and then figure out, I could help you with this if you wanted, I don't know if it would be helpful, but it's just something to consider, but or set something up recording on your computer actually would be better because then the file would be good, and then we could give it to like an AI to scan it, but you'd have to check it and make sure that it's right, and it may not even save enough time for you, but that's something that I could teach you how to do, and it could be fairly quick, and it may save you a little bit of time, but it also may help you capture something that you forgot to take a note on, because one thing that I have always struggled with and why I do like the AI note takers despite the fact that they capture things incorrectly is that I find it difficult to be, to take really good notes and also have a really good meaning, like I can be fully present in the conversation, Or I can fully capture the conversation, but I can't do both really well.
00:07:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's true.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's something to consider that you could do that. And even if it's just recorded and then go back over later to make sure you did something. But what I want you to consider, both of you, is that there's a lot of leverage in those types of meetings, the feedback that you get. And the opportunity to take that and to improve it and to also look for the leverage in that feedback is is potent. So, for example, the conversation you had with John, who feels like he doesn't have enough time in the day to do everything he wants to do, you brought up the conversation that we had that is about efficiency. Why does he want to spend more time, probably because he feels like he could serve the clients better? And the end result is that it isn't about the time, it's about the result, right? Yeah. They really didn't come to Sweet Law to find a friend and they came here to get their issue taken care of and to get the greatest settlement that they can so that they can have the healing from their injuries and whatever else taken care of, right? So and you talked to him about that.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I had mentioned to him that 10 years I've been practicing, I've never closed a case and after the fact that the client called me to see how I was doing.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that as an example. That is an awesome example.
00:08:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They only call when they need something.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And then how did he respond to that?
00:08:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I told him that. told him, look, know, it's the reason. They like you or want to have a relationship. you ship with you, it's to the extent that you can help them. And if the only thing you provide is a good listening ear, that's not enough for how much money they're paying. They need, you know, they need their their law firm to be efficient to work on their cases rather than. And, you know, that's all I told him, look, you can, it's fine to listen to clients, and they'll probably feel a little bit better for five minutes afterwards. But ultimately, you know, the reason they hire us is because of the service we can provide to them. They have friends already.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a feel even better when the case is resolved than they were for that five minutes of conversation.
00:09:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But the question was, how did John respond to that? Did it? How did he respond? Yeah, he said he agrees. You know, he says he agrees in theory is just like when he's in the moment, he has a hard time.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make him a sign.
00:09:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Make him a little sign. Dickey never entered. I told him you'll set a timer to it. Yeah, I really.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have the timer though, but there's something really powerful about a visual reminder and what and have him write a note for himself if it's helpful, but I would suggest that it is and he should try it and write it in his own language and ask him, you know, like, do you believe that that that's true? Do you believe that you can serve them better by moving their case along and getting it resolved? So the first thing that you need to know is does he agree with that and is he bought into that? Does he really understand it or does he disagree? Because if he's not really bought into that mentality, he's going to keep struggling. He's going to continue to feel this this pull and this dissonance when, you know, he's trying to push a call through and I don't have enough time in the day. So,
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What you're saying is give him the tools to implement the conversation you've had.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's multiple parts of it, right? So he clearly still had some conflict over what is the best thing to do. Because if he didn't have conflict, he would have just been like, you're right, I gotta move forward. Because he would have been agreeing that that is the best thing he can do and the best way he can serve them. That doesn't sound like that's what he said. Did it not sound like there's still some conflict to you?
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think, well, I think I understand what you're saying. I think you're saying like if he really believed in it, he would. be able to to keep the conversations short. But the fact that he still has a hard time in practice shows that he doesn't really believe in it.
00:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what you're saying? Yes. So and it's a matter of priority. So a lot of times, most of the time, people are not conscious of priority period. They haven't even made a choice to decide that there is a thing that matters most. And I'll tell you how you can tell that this shows up in lots of people. People will say, I'm a family man. I love my family so much. then they spend 80 hours a week in the office. Those two things do not really say the same value. Now, there are different ways that that happens, right? if you think that the most valuable thing that you have to give to your family is financial security, then then that's an alignment. But if you ask your family what they value most, they'd probably say your time over that financial security. It's not always true. But my point is that there are a lot of times where we tell ourselves a half truth, right? We don't complete the story. So I'll give you an example for me. It was that my children are the most important thing to me. And then I heard somebody talking about how we save our best manners for strangers. And they gave examples of one and you're like, oh yes, thank you. No, whatever. Even when you're mad, really being polite to people and then going and snapping at kids. And I was like, I do that. I was so upset with myself. I was like, why would I let anybody else have better manners than my children. So let, lady, you're annoying me, you're going to get my attitude and my kids are going to get that happy because I'm going to let you have what you just are. I mean, I'm not, I am. I'm really that girl. Anyway.
00:14:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but there's, there's fewer immediate consequences, right?
00:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing that I want you guys to really notice is a lot of times we have half conversations with other people, half conversations with ourselves. We don't really explore the fullness and one of the things that rarely gets really clearly defined is values, almost everywhere you go. So we have a concept of a value, but what we don't do is go, okay, of the things that I'm facing right now, which is the greatest value? Because there are almost always convening values, in everything that we do. So, you know, for salespeople, maybe you think you're a person of integrity, and also maybe you've got a sales quota. A lot of times, that integrity drops priority to hit the quota. So we want to look for where there are competing values. So John's value is maybe I want people to like me. Does he like to be liked? Does he need to be liked?
00:15:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'd say so. Yeah, he's definitely not.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a yes, I know nothing about John, but just by this habit, I can tell that about him.
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:15:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is deeply ingrained and not going to change quickly. And it's not going to change without his conscious effort. So first, he has to be conscious of the fact that he needs people. People don't like him. Is he handle distributions, Lawrence?
00:16:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's that?
00:16:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
Does he handle distributions?
00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Kind of. We we have distribution meetings and I drive the negotiations and then they send they send off the the final distribution to the client. Client has needs some questions answered. They'll try to answer the questions first and then I'll come in.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is your concern Patrick that that's not a good batch?
00:16:43 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, the reason I ask is because I used to kind of have the same tendencies as John. When I first started and like every client was like super important, I would spend all this time with them. The reason I kind of stopped like really investing so much time and just talking with them is because when it would come time to dish. distribution and they would see the amount that they were gonna get they would just totally change and it was like Yesterday you were saying all these nice things and now happy you were for all the help and then now that you see the number you're getting this like totally Opposite bad review like so that kind of helped me understand that like you know I'm gonna do my best to help these people, but I'm not gonna Spend all this time just talking to them getting them to really like me because at the end of it They're probably gonna turn around and be mad at you for the amount that they're getting any ways So that's when I like really felt it on my skin and I was like that's when I kind of understood what dynamic I should have with them Yeah, I guess that's like two ways of saying the same things is I think I'm I'm concerned with Is it is not establishing solid boundaries right away, but you're saying
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
those boundaries, you and Patrick are saying those boundaries come from values.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His value is I feel good by making them feel good. I want them to like me and be happy with me. What you need to do is remove the veil of falseness, which is that's not even real. There is no friendship, they don't like you, they may be in a good mood and happy with you for moment because you're doing something. But number one, if your real value is I want to do the best job that I can for them because they'll be as happy as they can be with it, then the best job is the best job and that isn't about listening to them and feeling like they're in a good mood. That's a pacifier. That's thumb sucking is what it is. It's don't say that's it.
00:18:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's a Tina with no sound skills.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always people's favorites, but it's what it is. It's placating himself. actually, not the client. So what you need to do is find a way. And it's important. The reason I'm making sure it's very clear to you is because what you need to do is walk down that path. And so you can try to say it as gently as possible. But if you have to tell him he's basically sucking his thumb for his own comfort, if you know what but that they that they can see is true to go. Oh, and some people will never hear it. And that is important also. You need to know can they acknowledge the truth? Because if they can't, you cannot coach them better. So you're going to continue to have this issue. Then you have to decide, you know, trade offs being what they are. Is that an issue you can tolerate? Or is that an issue that you need to coach towards termination? And, you know, if all other things being considered, he does a good job. Sometimes we just have to tolerate that people aren't doing a great job because that's the situation that we're in. so, but you at least need to know where that's at, because also you don't want to just keep having the same conversation over over But, as you can see, like we've spent 15 minutes talking about this. There's a lot of nuance to it, nuance to why these issues happen and how you can resolve them if you can resolve them and understanding what the default behavior is in a person that causes them to operate in a certain way. Sometimes it's just because of ignorance. Sometimes it's because of psychological. this needs that they want to have net and they're just not aware and sometimes they can fix it and sometimes they can't. So you understanding why the thing happens first as his supervisor is important. So then maybe that you can find a way to help them through that. So and it comes up and other things. All right, so let's move on past that, ponder that a little bit, kind of come up with an action plan, trust your instincts, you know him, you know, use your own language to have those conversations, but consider the conversation about values, about needs like needs to be liked and and helping him be aware and decide, you know, what he wants to work on in himself. end in the business and also discuss competing values, the value of doing the best job or feeling the best about it for a little while while he's on the call with the person because those two really don't have any true relationship as Patrick illustrated. Okay, you so, man, there's a lot we probably spend most of this time talking about everything that went through on these meetings because on your meetings and notes that you took, because this is going to be about leadership and managing your resources. So I'll make sure to save a little time at the end. And if there's anything like Patrick, if there's anything you want to bring up. And we'll talk about this, but because you talk such really good notes, even even if it took you two weeks, these are good notes. So focus on the win, not that we could have done better. We can all always do better. better, you know, that's true, but this is good. One that you had the meetings, two that they were thorough, and three that you had good notes, and also your notes illustrate your understanding of it. And I can tell that you coached well. So that was good. Okay. So you talked about efficiency. I've also got some Patrick sent me an email. not sure if we talked about it together. I want to go over some of the stuff that he shared to. I don't know, my days are like 10 years ago was like yesterday and yesterday was like 10 years ago, like, and it gets worse. older I get. Okay. Anyway, stressed out about older cases, talked about the need to just touch them at least once a week, and they won't seem overwhelming. Okay. So I loved this. One of my strengths is consistency and it's movement. And it doesn't matter if it's a something very powerful. At the end of the day, when you go and you kind of take inventory and take stock of what I have. up in, you don't have those big goose eggs right on the board. don't have like, I did nothing here, nothing here, nothing there. You may not have a win all across the board, but you have movement. And there's something very powerful psychologically at the end of the day when you're going through that without having those big zeros. You know what I mean? Knowing that there was nothing that didn't get touched that needed to be. And so what people tend to do a lot of times is procrastinate, you know, and just leave themselves a whole bunch of stuff to do. But when part of the job is waiting, and most of the job is waiting, waiting for insurance to get back to you, waiting for the client to get back to you, waiting for all these different things, the frequency of the touches has a whole lot to do with how well that case goes. It should never be held up by Sweet Law. Never. everything should be moved on your end, steadily, all the way through. One of the things that can help that is the kind of the time-blocking that I think that we talked about a little bit, sometimes like the days run into each other, client conversations run into each other because I'm talking about the same thing all the time. But it is doing like tasks with like tasks, like and Patrick and think last week, which is you know distributions, types of conversations. So if the work is making phone calls versus writing things up versus checking email. Keeping like stuff with like stuff will help you get into a flow better rather than constantly changing types of tasks.
00:25:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense Lorenz?
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out of curiosity pastor, did you have any thoughts about that? Since we spoke about it last week, did it come up for you at all?
00:26:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
What topic exactly like categorizing doing certain tasks together?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so one of the things that we talked about specifically was checking email frequently versus just trying to get in a rhythm of certain types of tasks, letting it come to some type of clothes rather than going, oh, there's an email or something else.
00:26:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, like yeah, I've been checking it less throughout the week after we spoke. But like this morning, it was like, and I walked in and checked my email. saw there was like a few distributions that needed to get done and it was like an hour just spent on that. You know, getting the client's addresses to send checks, sending it to counting, so that was like an hour block. off just to get those done. After that, I think I wrote two demands. that was like sometimes spent there. And then I just did like, had some offers, gave the clients calls about offers. That was like another 30 minutes. So it does make things quicker because I'm in the state of mind of negotiating or, you know, convincing a client to sign something. It's not like I'm going from, you know, a bad conversation with an adjuster and then have trying to sway the client to sign a distribution. It's like, yes, angry to know I need to be very convincing.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, you know, so it's energy management and mental focus. And I love, I'm so glad that you were able to observe even any kind of shift in the week, because what happens is that gets even better. Because I'll take it back to consciousness. Like we were talking about. consciousness and values and people generally just not even being conscious of the fact that the thing that they're doing is based on a value. Sometimes the value is fun. I'm doing this because this is fun. Sometimes the value is, and frequently, consequence avoidance, right? Almost, I don't even know what the percentage is, but if you think about what you watch a lot of people do, it's consequence avoidance. Something got their attention and they're doing it because they don't want something bad to happen. The proactive people who are constantly working because they're building and they're creating intentionally, do you think that that's the majority of the people that you know? Just kind of scan people in your life. People who are always on purpose, always like, I'm doing this because of this because of this because of this because this is what I want. Or is it more like, yeah, I got to do this. I got to do this, because otherwise this, and I got to do that, because otherwise this, right? So what you're doing is becoming the first person who is intentional about everything, everything, rather than reacted and consequence avoiding, you are driving towards a specific consequence, only good consequences, right? By being more conscious about why you do these things and how you spend your time, rather than like I said last week, to, I got an email or some sort of stimulus, a phone call, just a thought that popped into your head, oh, I should do this, which is me ADHD. So I got to really think about, okay, wait, don't do that just because a pop, a head popped popped in your head. Do that because it is that the thing to do right now. So the compounding effect of the way that you're choosing to behave is first of all, because you're allowing yourself to. to get into flow, you're going to get better at all of those processes way faster than you would have if your bed mode shifted constantly. So you'll probably get better at distributions because you're staying in a zone for a little while, you'll probably get better at all those types of tasks. Now that won't be as noticeable as quickly, but I'm going to tell you it will happen. Have a little faith in me, trust me, keep watching it because you tried that experiment and you're like, Oh, was actually. But the other thing is, and I don't think I brought it up to you last week, maybe I did, but you brought it up is the energy shift. So that's a really important thing, things that make you grumpy. I think we have talked about it at one time.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Have I told you guys about energy sandwiches that sound ring about little?
00:30:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing, right? Some of the things that we do really suck. And specifically, some of the things we do make us kind of probably in a bad mood because they're contentious by design. So, Well, distributions is doesn't have to be contentious, but it can be probably as a lot of times dealing with certain insurance companies, they farm, know, there's it's conflict. So that's not something you want to do where you got to go, you know, try to get something out of a client because that's going to put you in bad mood. So you want to sandwich something that kind of regulates you in between. So email might be a good time because you can like calm down a little bit, take a beat and then go make phone calls where you're not taking the energy of dealing with this negative person to this client. Does that make sense? So, like I said, there's a lot of tiny little things about how you do your day to day stuff that has nothing to do with the law has nothing to do with a lot of things, but just the way you think. And just the way you choose to do your work. So keep that in mind. Stress about all the cases. Okay, touching them stress about him. getting firm numbers. So I love this. When he feels like there are so many things outside of his control zone, client response time, clients following through with treatment insurance limits. And you talked about how to do the things that we can control really well in order to minimize the effect of things that we don't control. I was like, yes, I read that and I like, you go friends, that was awesome. And I can totally see Pat in his very calm demeanor, saying the same type of thing. Like, who is he doing that? Because I feel like you're trained for that, for the military. I just know you shared enough that I think that that's something you would do.
00:32:39 - Patrick Shahverdian
Am I wrong?
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. All right. So good job, you guys. Okay. So John still wants to know what he can do to make his job a long term career that allows him to provide for his growing family. And you talked about how to become indispensable by consistently growing as a case manager, team lead. Mentor for Mary and Paralegal. I love that. That is one of my favorite things. have two kind of I don't know, M.O.'s part of my M.O. two aspects to my M.O. which would be one having unimpeachable character. That means I am the same everywhere. My feistiness, I will punch an old man in church if he's encroaching upon a young lady's face. I don't care. You can be high priest. I don't care. If you crowd a knee back off and if you don't take the signal, I have punched people. Okay. I'm a defender at all times. I'm enthusiastic all times. I love God and Jesus at all times. I sometimes swear really badly. Jesus loves me at all times. You know, but that means because I'm the same everywhere that I go that if somebody says something and it is out of alignment with my character, everybody's gonna do know that that's not true. Even if they don't like me and they don't want to defend me, they'll just be like, that's not possible because she's literally always the same person. So unimpeachable character meaning just you're just the same and you're person of quality and integrity. I sometimes I'm not the most polite I can be rude, but I'm never hurtful, I'm never vengeful, I'm never dishonest, I'm never um anything that somebody would go like those qualities, right? So that's one thing. The other thing what was the oh this I am always seeking to increase my value to those I serve. So I think everybody is technically replaceable, but that word indispensable is one that I'm always looking for. I've been a consultant for 22 years. My business is 100% what I'm mouth. I have not done any marketing and it's been a six figure business for working about 10 to 15 hours a week, by the way, since, I don't even know, it's about nine years. So, I have the people pay me a lot and in my industry, I am an anomaly. This doesn't happen. My business stands out even at like the highest level coaches. There are a few exceptions that that can do what I do, but almost nobody does. And here's why is because when I feel like, and this has happened several times, I feel like we're having the same conversations and we're just maintaining, but we're not growing. Well, my job is growth. My job is improvement. They can maintain if they get to the point where they're like, yeah, Tina, I'm doing all the things you taught me. I've got nothing else to teach them, then I don't lose that client. I don't want to, mostly because all my clients are really awesome, but also because then I've got to go replace that and I don't want to do that either. So I'm always sharpening my saw. I'm always looking for a way to be better at what I do. I'm looking at the new technologies, I'm improving my study of psychology, I'm improving my study of leadership, I'm improving my study of operations, and because I'm always growing, and also because I'm working with people who are always growing, that conversation continues to evolve and I know that they're not having that conversation anywhere else. Plus I'm paying attention to them, I'm taking notes, I'm thinking about what they're working on throughout the week. I don't just talk to them and then I don't think about them until I talk to them again the next week. And so because of that, I know because most of us don't have somebody that is really paying close attention to how well we're doing, and looking to make sure that we're doing better every week. So I know that I'm serving a very unique function for people that probably no one else is serving except for maybe their mama's. No. And so what you said is great is what are the functions that he can serve that maybe other people in the team aren't serving or what can he do best, but because we can't all do, like there are some things I just, I don't pay attention to details really well. So I do if I'm listening, but if you're going to give me a 20 page document, I'm never going to read it and I'll read half of it because I will read a paragraph and then there's my place and think a new thought and my brain just can't focus. So we've all got weaknesses, things that we don't do really well. The point is not to try to get better at the things that we don't do well. The point is to be excellent at the things that we do well because that's already in our real house and what that does is create so much lift that where our weaknesses creates drag the lift over compensates for that does that make sense uh so I love that you did that how did he respond to it um I mean he he was positive and he agreed with me which is his natural response you know that did he and this is what I want you to listen for and I also want you to tell him if he doesn't give this to you that this is what you're looking for and the conversation is not going to end until he does this which is give me an example of how you would do that what do you think about when I say that what does that look like to you open ended so he can't parent your words back to him and if he tries to parent your words back to him you say okay but that's what I say said. In your own words, what does that mean? What does that look like? And then you can just be quiet and let him sit in the awkwardness. However long it takes until he decides to not well also did you know that I think it's like two twelve is statistically across the board the least productive minute of the hour of every day and guess what our meaning is it's right around there so I won't take it personal just little bit just little bit and I'm sick did you eat oh that's not good did you eat chicken or beef I did the chicken first today so now you get to look forward to the beam all right all right all right this is last Please come and say some words. Um, so with John, there's, there's a little work to do, but I love what you're doing. I love the goals, nine cases ready for demand, 200 K and fees. So what I would like to see, I don't know if you have this next week is, and this may take some time in my brain literally can't even picture the start of it because generally when I want something like this, I will create a foundation. But I would love to see team steps, um, with all the cases that you have, who's working on what on a spreadsheet and then what that equates to monetarily so that we can track that improvement so that we can track your performance, your leadership performance. Obviously, we're going to have the big number at the end, which is what are the gross to. but if we break it down by how each individual set of goals impacted that bottom line number, then you'll be able to have an even bigger impact to that bottom line number, because now you know what the little levers are, right? specific goals by what specific people was able to create that lift?
00:41:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:41:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Patrick, can you do something like that for your team too?
00:41:31 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean, I've still yet to speak with Cynthia for a monthly meeting, but I spoke with Elsie on Friday.
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can start. Maybe you guys like could power out together or we can just do it on a meeting together, because pacing wise, it isn't massively urgent. It's as important as it is important to you. But I promise you that the experience of organizing your data, visually so that everybody can see where we are, what the the micro goals are for the macro goal, which is, you know, whatever your attorney fees target that you're trying to hit and settlement fees. There's something really powerful when you see the numbers there, especially when you see the pattern of the numbers and how it's changed over time. And generally, with almost no exception, I'm just going to say, because I can't think of an exception, there probably is one. But when you start to visualize and you have those goals, and the reason there's no exception is generally because of the people that I work with, the caliber that they are and the caliber of their teams and their efforts and whatever, is that it automatically starts improving. And then what happens is people see their improvement. So a lot of their self doubt and their excuses go away. because the evidence is irrefutable and they know everybody else is seeing what they're doing good plus they also see everybody else is good so that kind of inspires competition but in a healthy way really you want people to compete against themselves not everybody else so whatever your best is this month best it next month if you can we know that seasons don't really work that way and really prefer overall looking at year over year rather than month over month uh because of the dips so you just want to make sure that the average is increasing remember how we looked at your document um Lorenz and we were looking at the averages which is also something on a gover let me any notes to self uh we'll do that for fathom so i want to remind myself that i want to go over oh attorney fees okay so anyway your spreadsheet with the Averages, but I also want to go to mark who said he will get us a report that you guys can look at that has Oh, he gave it to you.
00:44:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he didn't tell me not not not do attorney fees, but the settlements.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I Want you to see attorney fees too. I Want you to see everything. I want you to see who's hitting percent who's who's maxing Policy limits. I Want you to see all the stocks. Do you not want to know?
00:44:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah I feel like he's keeping that pretty close to the best. No, I don't think I don't think that's the case, but I I'm not asked No, well, that's not true because he does publish attorney fees once in a while doesn't he mark that trick Yeah, he doesn't do it at the end of the month. So like he doesn't do it on the last day of the month
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the reporting is inconsistent. I don't think it has anything to do with keeping close to the best, but Mark doesn't like doing that.
00:45:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I misspoke.
00:45:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think he keeps it close to the best. Yeah, I mean, even if he did and he chose to do it, there would be a reason for it and I would probably get behind it. So it's not an issue, but I'm just thinking based off of the conversations we've had that it's probably less of that report exists easily and making sure that everybody has access to the report. Because there has to be assignments and all of that stuff. anyway, but the average attorney fee plus total attorney fees plus cases, because if you guys can see that, both of you would feel pretty good about some stuff. And until I get to share that, I'm just going leave with her. right. So, you said she's happy and feels like she's learning a lot each day so and that she feels like. she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. Is that just like, did you feel really good about that?
00:46:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and she's, you know, there's definitely things, you know, I still want to work on with her, but she is kind of growing into her own. It's good to see, it feels good to see that.
00:46:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just two months ago, she felt really guarded and you kind of had to pry things out. Yeah. And you set an intention of helping her feel safe. That was one of the first conversations I had with both of you is like, you know, be aware that you have the ability to do that for people. And from what I could tell, I didn't witness anything, but Viri seems very guarded and unsure. And for you to have a report like that two months later, when we only talk, you know, we've had maybe six conversations all together.
00:46:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, she's really, really kind of, you know, her shell is kind of cracked open.
00:47:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want you to think about this. Imagine that this is your, your wife your daughter or your mom or whatever, right? A woman that you care very much about. And she goes to work and feels like I don't want to lose my job and I'm kind of afraid to speak up. And then two months later, she comes back and she feels like she's happy. She's learning a lot and she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. How would you feel to see that woman that you cared about, have that kind of environmental change at work? Is that a little thing?
00:47:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, it makes me happy. I'm happy for them. proud for them. I'm proud that they're, you know.
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was my sister because my sister has had some issues with some terrible people and that she went from a place where it was a hostile environment to she felt like that. Life-changing. And I need you to understand that because you created that intentionally. That's really important. I think that you need to understand that you improved her quality of life, not just work, because do we not all take some of the stuff home with us?
00:48:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's just, I'm just, that's a big win and I'm great job. Thank you. Okay. So feeling like she doesn't have enough time for tasks, ask her to set three non-negotiable tasks each day in order to prioritize more efficiently. I love that. And the other thing about that is you are helping her set wins and wins. Like I was talking about those goose eggs at the end of the day, they feel terrible. But if you have some big W's on the board, when you go at the end of the day, those goose eggs, that they are there, they don't feel as bad. You guys are understanding what I'm saying when I'm talking in that analogy, right? doing yes. Okay. No, Patrick, are you being a smart alec?
00:49:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, Goose, what do you mean by Goose?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goose egg, it's a zero.
00:49:17 - Patrick Shahverdian
Why does that do a geese?
00:49:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is some expression.
00:49:24 - Patrick Shahverdian
I figured it out, but I was just wondering. About the egg.
00:49:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, I lost you.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really hope that didn't freeze in some terrible looking. You did. Good thing I don't know what that looks like. Okay. Anyway, scoreboard, a big zero goose egg, right? So that means, you know, mentally looking at it as or an L, right? loss, something that didn't get done that is emotionally impacting you because you're like measuring all the things. that you should have done and you've got this, this weight of that wasn't there, you know, like imagine you're, you're in a, you know, tournament, you're looking at the scoreboard and it's a zero, like that just sits there grinding at you versus counting your win. So if none of us can get all the things done every day. So you had our set three non-negotiable tasks, which automatically insinuates that those were chosen by a priority, right, and a value, because how do you decide it's non-negotiable?
00:50:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
had to have some sort of valuation process.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you, it was embedded in there, even if you didn't talk about it specifically, you did. And then what you gave to her is that if she is able to complete those three non-negotiable tasks, she automatically has three solid wins every day. Yep. that's really powerful.
00:51:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, something that we did in my last law firm. I want to add on to that, you know, as she builds that habit, but it's like a, I think it's Tony Robbins method for what is the three set three non-negotiable tasks. Eventually, you want to set like three tasks that are not as important, but it would be nice if they got done and that helps you organize your brain in terms of priorities rather than what's in front of you.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and it keeps you focused because if you're trying to think about everything, that's overwhelming. But if you're just focusing on those, those non-negotiables or Stephen Covey uses it as big rocks. It's a big difference. Okay, so feel safe with our team, challenge her to take a more active role in meetings and take more client calls. I love that. She wants to move 10 cases ready for demand. and then we'll push on collecting medications. Okay, so nice clear goals. started making intro calls for new clients and said she needed more training from John in order to feel more comfortable. So with John talking as much as he does, make sure that you record those calls so that you can also say, okay, here's what was great about that. Here's what I don't want you to do. Kind of thing.
00:52:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just. I have a plan actually. have a grand master plan about those intro calls.
00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's that?
00:52:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me talk. Mike, if you scroll down to Mike, one of those goals is we're going to do this together as we we're going to start drafting an intro call script. And we want to make it pretty standardized across the board so that when files shift from one team to the The other is not like, well, why didn't we get that information? Now I got to go back and get that information myself. Um, love that because we're working on that with intake. Did you know that? Uh, yeah, Mark has hinted at it.
00:53:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We've been working on it for months, but we've been talking about it for over a year.
00:53:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So just, you know, takes a because that name, you know, the attorney intro call is a lot shorter. Welcome to the forum. Do you have any questions? know, this is kind of the process for 10,000 views is what's going to happen. My, my, my will be in touch with you. But from the assistance point of view, there's so many things to think about that I think sometimes they either focus too much on two or three points and not get the other points or sometimes they just like, it's like an over little bit of information we don't need. Yeah. They spend too much time on the floor on those intro calls.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you did that. And something else to consider is almost kind of a, like a game plan. So what do you do if this happens on the call? For example, they go off the rails telling us about all of this stuff, call control. We talked about call control skills, right? So to me, that's what you're implementing is a specific game plan for managing and controlling the calls that are had with the clients. Probably be done elsewhere too, but especially with the clients where people are often going to feel like the client is driving the conversation, but really we should always be driving. We know where they need to go. We know how they need to get there. We know what needs to happen. We know what's not helpful, you know. So I love that.
00:54:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I don't know, they all responded, I'll ask them all how they felt about bringing in some people to. give some training about regarding call control. They all were pretty excited about that.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is awesome.
00:55:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
an option that you're considering.
00:55:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just have to get Mar, where's my note that? On board that, okay. Team wants call control training. Yeah, I think that would be amazing. Having had that experience myself been like changing. Literally, because I use it in all kinds of conversations, like the way people use probably the numbers put the different kind of tactics. I use that all the time. And to be able to politely interrupt, nobody likes it. But even if you don't like it, you can help kind of assuase them so they don't there. and really focus on them as though everything else doesn't exist. But you need that context. need the things like, hey, Mark's the guy. can call it 10 o'clock at night or message at 10 o'clock at night and ask a question. And he's responding with help, not, hey, idiot, why didn't you get this figured out? It's 10 o'clock. Why are you bothering me? That kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that context matters. So Mark gets to be a human being like the rest of us. And if he stressed, you know, it might come out. So not excusing it if it's if it's ever bad and that if there's a conversation that needs to be had then have that. But I'm sure all of you are just like sometimes like if something's really stressed, it's hard to hide it. What we can do though is just make sure that what we say is true. So maybe he is disappointed. I get disappointed with things. I did it on the call with Mark yesterday. I was asking him about something. He said something I'm like, I am flabbergasted. You just said that to me. we Hey, I'm talking about this for three years, and I ask you this question, you telling me it's hard? I don't care if it's hard. Blah, Yeah, anyway, so. Okay. my God. He's still very nice to me though. Yeah, so anyway, again, if there's an issue that's a real issue that needs to be addressed, then let's have that conversation. But if it just is uncomfortable to be told, we could do better and we need to do better, and we don't like how that feels, we can probably get over that. Now, if you're being insulted, if you're being degraded, if you're being told you're worthless, if you're being like, why do you always fail? Like, you know what I mean? That type of stuff, that's unacceptable, that should not happen. But if you're being told you can do better, we've had this conversation multiple times, that's a real thing, right? So, keeping those and then really counting, okay, but what can we rely on?
00:59:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
ion and what that does for you is helps them make sure that they're looking at other people like that not just Mark or not just you but they could probably relate that to you too like if you get impatient from time to time and you give them this conversation then they would be like oh yeah I can relate that to Lauren because he was not happy about this but he's also the same guy that's like how are you doing how can I help you here's some tips blah blah blah you know what I mean like yeah and I and I reassured her that you know a lot of that is because she's working away from the office she doesn't get the physical instant feedback and physical cues and you know body language and expressions yep and so this it can be triggering when you don't get that feedback over time you kind of feel a little bit you can feel a little bit suspicious of everything everything everyone says you know
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you guys get kudos from Mark's like, hey, good job.
01:00:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You did this really well Yeah, he said good job to me a couple of times and that yeah, I mean Realistically Mark when that's concerned like I'm very focused on what what else can we do to to keep improving and So sometimes I forget to like let the people know that yes, you are improving. Yes, you're growing.
01:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, you're doing a good job I guess so what I'll ask him is being his coach also is like Do you feel like you look for an opportunity to compliment everyone? Sincerely, but it is One thing that we all need to do. So if and there's also a kind of, well, coaching. Okay. I'm complimented.
01:01:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel the same Patrick? I would really like your thoughts on that.
01:01:16 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, he's told me good job. know, for me, I mean, because I don't have as much experience. Sometimes I don't know if I'm doing like enough for. Like sometimes I may feel like my numbers are good that month. But then he's like, you know, we suck this one. So I really don't know if I'm doing a good job sometimes, but I take it more as like. You know, he comes and talks to me basically every day, once a day, just to check in. So as long as he's not like bringing something up bet negative, then I take that as, you know, just keep going. Because like if there's something wrong, be like, hey, I need to get you to get this done or. So I don't expect them to be like a good job on every case.
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't think that's effective or whatever, but I do want to know, do you, um, because there may be subordinates, maybe they don't get as much interaction and maybe they only hear if something is wrong, but also I'm an extractor. So if I don't know how things are going, I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask everybody, I'll ask clients, I'll ask, like people may, I may report to them, but I don't think anybody's above me. Well, they are in respect, you know what I mean, but, but some people are never going to ask for that. They do need to hear some level of, you know, or they, for sure, at least not need to just hear what's wrong, you know what I mean? But female staff might be more inclined to feel that, I'm not sure.
01:02:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And Marci Fence, he is, like, I've discussed this with him before and he is very well aware of that. blind spot. And he's, you know, he's made, he's really, like, made lot of effort to go out of his way to help.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is members night and day from the time we started working together. So that's good. But it's just nuance. And we all need it. We all need somebody to help us see what our blind spots are. So it's not a pick on anything. And I wouldn't care about it. And I wouldn't be here if Mark didn't care very much about everyone and how he shows up. He shows up every single week. Has that passed away? He came to our call the next day. He's like, I'm not messing this. That was amazing to me. So, you know, we're talking about it, but we're talking about it because we're all here to grow. And I just want to know, so I wouldn't just be like, Hey, you're a jerk, but I would ask him.
01:03:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think, you know, to go back to Jessica, this is not about Mark. Like it is, but it isn't.
01:04:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more about like, you know, when you feel isolated for a while and start thinking about disconnected. But that's also part of the structure of Sweet Laws. There's a lot of remote stuff. So what can we do to help facilitate that feeling of connection and that unity and that confidence. So if this is the structure that we choose to operate in, and that's the company that he's created, what can we do to help make sure that the human resources, right, are getting the human needs met and taken care of. So because he chooses to be the best leader that he can and he's always working on it, I want to know that so that I can share with him. What do you think about how you do this? Whatever. It's a small thing, but it's an important thing. And it's one of those things that we work on. And it's also something I don't get a lot of insight into because I'm not in the office. So and we only have an hour a week that we're talking. We've covered are a lot of browned so that's helpful but I promise you I'm not making it into a big thing be that okay anyway um 204 uh my concern with the amount of handholding necessary to take care of sweetball clients feels like it's eating into other clients times it's almost like the opposite of John um so that's interesting yeah if there are ever two polar opposites that'd be John might they are complete offices I would be really interested to see what happened if they um doubled up on each other's calls for a little bit and just you know like like Y swap kind of like what is this like um ponder on that a little bit because I don't want to take really much more time I want to go through this really quickly and then we'll just table the rest for our next time um concern with time management I love this three non-negotiables once they keep getting case closed out um want for more big cases there's not Not a lot of control over that. Everybody wants bigger cases. If Mark would have it be that every case is a big case, so there's that doesn't love case review, meaning I love that. So the one thing I wanted to point out here is that if we get some stats that everybody can watch, what you're going to be able to do is say, OK, is when this was our data before we started these team review meanings together. OK, and this is our data after. There is obviously a correlation because we didn't really change much else. And so as you start to implement things and you're watching your stats improve, you get to then reinforce their understanding that I didn't just tell you to do something randomly that it was strategic, that there was a reason for it. And here is the fruits of your labor. So in terms of just them being consistently, you're still doing the things that work because people tend to forget.
01:08:03 - Patrick Shahverdian
I don't know. I was thinking maybe for Jessica, like, you know, obviously she used to work here and now she's a remote, so maybe kind of reinforced the fact that, you know, Mark liked the work she did and allows her to continue to work remote because, you know, clearly he likes everybody to be in the office and, like, remote working is, like, last resort type of thing, so maybe that could... It's true. Reinforce her thoughts about how she's doing, like that.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I have only heard good things about Jessica and I don't hear things about pretty much anybody except the attorneys. I would always get her confused with America because he would have different tasks, he was doing certain things, and anyway, the point is I've heard good things, so that's something also.
01:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I told her, know, in my nose. That's basically what I explained. look, I know there's like a difference between like being in the office and not being in the office, but I can tell you from my end, I've not heard anything but good things from Mark and I want to, and Mary and everyone. think you should.
01:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you guys think about if we had just kind of like a Wednesday or something and like you or just some sort of highlight of somebody on your team did something good that you just make sure to pick out something good that anybody on your team did once a month and maybe I can get Mark to have this be like a sight-white thing, hey, just wanted to celebrate these people on my team. did this, this, and this and then maybe he, you know, do that for the attorneys too, but it's really, we're human and we do need to be told that we're doing a good job and there's a lot that happens when we get that public praise, know, we could just be like, oh, we're adults, we don't need that, but. We're human beings and we do need that. What do you guys think about me proposing that to him?
01:10:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'd be interested to see the structure so Yeah, I guess I've tried that with my kids and All they see is like I'm praising one of my kids and all the other ones see is that they're not doing that so Children is very different The timeline perspective and it's very selfish In because I'm working on my psychology degree.
01:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
learned a lot of things I had no idea and I wish that all parents knew and we really should have a manual. Okay, that's all I'm gonna say Subox off but That is part of it is just that the children are inherently and psychologically and development me developmentally very selfish and self-centered So it's an interesting correlation, but it's not probably the same thing and the thing is as it happens over time so like we could start it with let's celebrate everybody on a team okay so markets all his attorneys you guys get all your people and we just have a great big this is amazing you guys are amazing let's celebrate that and then after that maybe it's one one person each and we just intentionally rotate through and just keep it going because it really it feels good and we'll know it's not placating like you have to look for real things but you should be able to find them because the thing that there's quality people so and we don't want to phone in that effort we don't want to patronize them we want to say this was real and here's why it was real this is what value it brought to us it was a great job what do you think Patrick I think so I think it could get a little bit like I don't know how would it be like good job on getting this record in or no like really just so it could be a quality it could be a growth or something of improvement like I know
01:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
is this quality.
01:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
noticed this behavior. I noticed this improvement. And, you know, and maybe we reduce the frequency.
01:12:09 - Patrick Shahverdian
That's what I'm concerned about.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like if it's like, everyone's that type of thing that's special, then it's like.
01:12:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah.
01:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe we rotate with the attorneys in each week. One of the attorneys highlights one person on their team, or it could be the whole team. You know, it could be a win for the whole team. But really, they did want to make sure and pay attention and make sure that somebody's not left out and that everybody's getting celebrated. But yeah, so you guys would need to kind of brainstorm on what the frequency and structure would look like. But just the idea and the concept to make sure, especially because you guys are remote, like it could be a spotlight on the person, right? So you're not just talking about what they did great. It should be. something that's in there, but also who they are, what they like, how long they've been with sweet law, whatever. And as big as the team is, I mean, you could go one person a month or every other week or something like that. So there's ideas we don't have one defined yet, but I would love you guys to think about it. And just remember that these are human resources. We are people. We do have psychological needs. doesn't stop because we're on a job and getting paid. We'll do better and perform better if we take care of those psychological and emotional needs as well. Okay.
01:13:38 - Patrick Shahverdian
I do think it's important for sure.
01:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Well, you guys keep thinking about it because every week you impress me with all the things that you're learning and you're doing. And I think it's awesome. And I look forward to these calls. I was dead tired. I had zero energy. And then we're inside that email.
01:13:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
And you guys are here. And I froze in some really unattractive way now.
01:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just forget that image. You cannot see this anymore. Anyway, all right, you guys talk next week. Have a great week and that's it.
01:14:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
Good job. You too. Have a good long weekend.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Well, yeah, we're going to the beach. Bye. Bye. Take care. You too. Bye.

Okay, I'm just going to move on Yeah, I can hear you now. I'm just going to move down to my family room to sit on a more comfortable chair. I was in my other room office, but I got a nice chair here to sit on. Oh, yeah, yeah. I decided not to do anything with my hair or change it to a fancy shirt for any videos, even though I just did a little free coaching call to my school community. And I just think. Yeah. Totally relaxing. get my nails done at 4.15, so I can't wait for that.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm going to do my this now, but up again. is literally what I slept in, and this is my sleepy hair with a little bit of blushing. Yeah, let me get one, my little laptop thing that you put in your lap.
00:01:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, you buy those at Staples or whatever, of course.
00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Yeah, this week has been nuts. I don't know like what's up with my body.
00:01:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's actually like it's a good thing. Like I have more energy because I'm not wiped out all day long.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but yeah, it's a little weird.
00:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like your voice message.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was fun. You must have just woke up. You sound very sleepy. Oh yeah.
00:02:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was still in bed. Cool.
00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is how that was. mean, hi, browser.
00:02:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, how's that YouTube video going or YouTube out going for you?
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting nothing. But Dan said, well, like you said it's not clickable. And I just left it there. It's gotten views, but not a good ad.
00:02:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it has to be over a minute because I see it end up becoming a short, like when you send it to me. Yeah. I think that's why it's not clickable.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't care.
00:02:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I thought you did it.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, Yeah. That was the whole point. And it was not like not telling you like, I don't care. It's that. I actually care leaving it up causes me more discomfort and it's a good thing because it's need to do that. So I am in the practice of doing things that stretch me. Yeah. So that is the primary purpose of that. is this going? don't even know what this program is. trying to close. I don't even know what the app is. So I can't like, oh, that's CapCut.
00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, for a quick CapCut.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:03:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Mmm. Yeah. had to take some Claritin the last two days in a row actually.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would not be able to breathe without it. I have really bad asthma and L.R.G.'s. Okay. So one thing is, can we move this call half an hour later?
00:04:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. It could be later than half an hour, too, if you want.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. when I said it, I'm like, I'm going to be up, but I'm not even getting back from taking my daughter to school until almost 8, Not exercise eaten, and let me go look at my calendar real quick and see. Okay, so on Wednesdays, I've got missionary training. That's why I wanted it early on Wednesdays. Yeah, if we could do it at like 10, 30 or 11, which is two hours later or two and to all. all. at at not Let's see, let's this for next week. I'll put that there with this and all following events. Didn't move, it's not move, hold on. And then Tuesday. That will be amazing. That will be way better. Because I really want to be able to show up. But you were three hours ahead of me and you seem to be an early bird.
00:05:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was like, ah, but I am an early bird. So in your nighttime, I'm like, I shouldn't turn my phone off at six or try not to that on weekends. I'm usually not on or if I am on it's more, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, just creative spurt.
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've always been like that and my girls are like that so I can train myself to do whatever Yeah, to an extent. I definitely I'm physically affected by the moon the Sun the bar a barometric pressure Significantly I ache even if I don't know that the weather has changed. I feel it in my house in my bed. It's um, but I Teenagers and they don't want to talk into like midnight They're gonna be gone soon. So I want to be available and I'm like Yeah, so that's happened a few times to this week at them early and Yeah, this is this is the season that I'm in and I Oh, I'm not gonna get emotional, but because it's almost over.
00:06:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just here for all of Okay, so you
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got to find a Google Doc. I want to talk about all the things. There's so many things that are being things that you're working on, things that I'm working on. My most exciting thing that I want to talk to you about is what we can do together, but I do think that it's an exploratory process. So, and I want to put a priority, top, top priority on how do we get Maria incoming money right away?
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because Maria always does that for everybody else, I want to put that script in. Well, and also in a smart way that like, I, you know, I could, you know, put up a thing in analytics thing to do some stuff. It's just I don't want to be then tied up for the next month, doing done for you work at the cost of my stuff. So, so there's a happy medium. But I do know that I got pretty energized when I saw that YouTube video this morning about those guys that made it two million to nine months. I'm like, what? But yeah, I mean, there's, there's, and I have some, like, like one gal just paid me 500 this morning just to do a VSL script for her, which I know should be more, but I figure if it only takes me two solid hours to do it, I could just leverage that and sell maybe a few more in Ellen's group, because I just mentioned to her all, I was thinking of doing this, and she said, okay, I'll pay you. The licensing of the funnel that I've built, I'm in talks with this one guy that might want to buy it. So, but I've never done it before licensed on actual funnels, so I don't know what the details, so we'll see if that goes anywhere. But that basically, I would transfer the funnel, my ad copy, the actual ebook I created into his thing. But, There's some nuances to it though because it wasn't a profitable funnel. It's a break even funnel Which is still amazing for look take a funnel that was meant to sell People to kreena's and mine like you know now it's for just one cape product program and book a call to her 4800 things So that's the only thing and part of me was like if I have money just sitting in the bank account I could just run out to it in a new account and find a really good ecom Academy ecom course to Be an affiliate for and use the funnel cuz it was 20% conversion rate like for this $3 thing So I'm like man But that's the issue just missing a back end So I don't know if this guy would want it without a back end and I'm not going to that's kreena's intellectual property like how to Build a drop ship store and I don't want to go create a course without I don't want to sell it to him Without him knowing all of the details like I never want that because he could be someone to be the future that would buy other funnels that I'm make or something he knows.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right? So I mean, as long as you're up front about what he gets and what he doesn't get, then let him design.
00:10:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, that's what I've done. I've sent him everything. All the Facebook ads cost the screenshots of all the funnel stats, everything. So from the get go, this is really built for someone who already has a mid ticket or high ticket 1000 or more ecom kind of course and then it's perfect for them. But it's interesting. was I'm learning this because then he's like, let's say a ClickFunnels platform. said, well, no, I wouldn't get my ClickFunnels account. Like, so all these things, I guess some people who are into buying and selling funnels, it's a really interesting, you know, I guess they're used to you just giving them everything. So I think, like, if I were to do it again, I would put it into System IO and be like a separate account, right? Because like, that's it. And then here, here's just this my account and the email I set up for this funnel like that.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, you could duplicate eight. So, and this is what I was talking to Seth about doing, too, is because he's got that breakthrough challenge. And in Ontoport, you can just shove it into somebody else's Ontoport account. You can do that in high level. It's called Snapshot. And if you did that in System.io, but what if you duplicated that in these other things, and you said, oh, if you got System.io, it's already built for you. Here you go. Here's the cost of, so it's not even really a licensing fee. It's a, you know, how we had those, like, templates for VSLs and things like that. You could get infusion socks, campaigns, where they had it. It was, it was basically a part of infusion soft. wasn't a show they do it now. It's not even called that anymore. Now it's like a keep or something, right? Anyway, but you could either do it yourself. It probably wouldn't take too long as long as you were familiar. with it. But if it's basically so you've got landing pages, sales page, checkout pages, unless they're all in one, order bumps, fulfillment. Well, thank you pages, right? And then whatever the sequences are, all of the platforms are relatively similar. As long as you can navigate to it, you just create it and create the automations. It will probably only take you a few hours. And now you've got it in multiple platforms, and you can tell it to people on the platform that they're on. As long as the platform allows you to share it, like high level does, on-trip port does, and you'd have to have an on-trip port account, which is way too expensive for that, but high level.
00:12:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And system IO would be just copying the funnel or if I just create a separate account. Yeah. I'm still here. level for that too, to an extent. so yeah, so, so it is, we'll just see where that goes. And because yeah, I just had that brainstorm yesterday morning, I'm like, wait a minute. There's one on that basically, I created some tip to tail and it's like, what the ? Like, I should be compensated for this, you know? So, but it did make me think of all my other stuff, too. Like, I have micro for magic. I've got high ticket toolkit.
00:13:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have, like, a document, a library of what what offers you have and what you sold them for?
00:13:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, up to date current one, but yes.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I would probably just need an hour to make it up to date with stuff.
00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, what if, what if you did that and we brainstorm together and figure out maybe there's a different type of stock that you could offer or you offer this and then upsell down to all the type of thing. just to generate some cash for you without bogging you down timeways and done for you type stuff.
00:14:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if I crack the core on how to sell, like you mean like sell the funnel to other people, like to like.
00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, so like, yeah, the micro offer magic, like itself, if it's a course, like what I wanna see, what is your library of things that you have that you've sold that you could sell again, maybe with a couple of tweaks, maybe you need to update a checkout page, maybe you need to connect to people. I don't know, like what is everything that you have that is still relative, where you could put together an offer and say, you know, here's all the things, pick one, choose one, or pay this price and get everything, that type of thing.
00:14:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, like to the consumer to buy. Yeah, than like sell the actual pay, this is a converting funnel, I want this. Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because, so you said you need $3,000 a month, is your, like, light's on cost?
00:15:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, yeah, $3,000 a month, doesn't it? was really $5,000 a month?
00:15:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. if we could figure out, um, just, so I like to do hybrid things so that we reduce the burden, um, it's the done with you done for you stuff that has higher ticket and you can sell easier, but it comes with a bigger burden. So you want to kind of offset that with another type of offer, if you can, which doesn't increase the burden so much, but also gives you a little bit more income and then potentially has, you can sell other things affiliate offers, your own offers, whatever. But, um, so in order for us to sell, like, a 6k package, we don't have to do anything other than. Write an offer get some eyeballs on it. I'm thinking and You I mean if we sell two of those you're good We're right and and if if we can sell to you we can sell two more we can sell two more like Not all the ones right, but build up the queue for it. feel like that is the simplest way to Put some money into your need account and then siphon off the tiny for whatever We might be building and meanwhile give us a little time.
00:16:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give you some breathing space So that we can build something that's scalable and build some con together So wait, so let's just repeat that last part like if I brain just zoned out for a second but to me like If you and I create a 6k offer Sales page for or even a Google Doc with what's including right here's we get here's the problem is here's what you get That might be a faster path to cash in the next two weeks.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's exactly what I'm saying.
00:17:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, that's what I thought. And I agree. That's sort of why I've held off. was going to send out 30 looms a day to all my people saying, hey, I've got this 100 days to 1k days. You know, thinking of, you know, launching this and book a call for me if you're interested. then I was going to sell whoever gets on the call, but I know it's not a. I wanted to wait until we kind of strategize because yeah, because I'd rather have something we build together.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if I'm going to do looms, I'd rather do looms than to that.
00:17:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the most lovers thing because there's no overhead cost to that. So we can just split it 50 50. I can pay for ads if you're strapped right now and we just figure all of that later. So. And or I just paid for it and like you're doing some of the looms like that's the thing we can figure out how to split like I don't. there's a lot of things I don't like to do that you love to do. So if we figure out a good balance where you're happy with what you're doing, I'm happy with what we're doing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm sure that we can find those things really well. And of course, I'm a grown woman, I can do things I don't want to do and will do things I don't want to do. And likewise, but I think that's the fastest easiest thing to not bog us down to also establish a little bit of a brand awareness with us operating together. A kind of a mutual audience, which is going to have a different vibe than just Maria or Justina. And then when you have the money and you're reading, you're not like, how do I hustle up some money? Now we can talk about structure more frequently and really build out what's our long term thing, build our maybe individual courses, not individual, like a combined course, serve in the way that we're talking about, you know, we could and calls and co-working all of that stuff that we were discussing, but I think it's not, we can't even have that conversation until we've got money coming in for you if you don't have to worry about it.
00:19:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm supposed to get started for us working together, right? So now it's time to pull the trigger.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it'd be so great to fulfill that for somebody. You can't get a quality, that. I don't even know anywhere where you could go get somebody who's going to give you the business structure that I would give them and the marketing that you would give them. For that price and for the level of service that we would give them, the handholding that just we've got you and not talking down to you.
00:19:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's so much condescension in this world.
00:19:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You know, like, and I was talking to my love last night and he is so glad that I'm working. with no years and doctors and things like that. he's like, you just, he goes, I'm glad you're done with the internet marketing world.
00:20:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, I'm not, I'm never going to be, but here's why.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People need me. Like, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't have this experience if it wasn't for my path through here. Well, there are so many of us who, people just, they go here because the marketers are marketing. All they know is I need to make money and I need to do it from home because I've got kids or I'm taking care of my parents. Like I can't leave, but I need to change my life and the opportunities available to me aren't working. So they go online about business, the people that are the loudest are internet marketers. So that's who they're going to hear. said, I have to be there to teach them there is real business to be learned and taught and available to them in where they're at. They're in the internet marketing world. I'm going to be here being a voice of reason and logic and real systems. Real service, real values, real KPIs, you know, and not just how can I get money out of people as fast as I can and launch the next thing before they catch on to what I'm doing.
00:21:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:21:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Oh, this is reaction.
00:21:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He said, yeah, you're right. I know you have a call. just say it like that, but. Yeah, but it's been a long time trying to get him. Because he just hates that. He just knows how many of these people that and some of them look like. Christian choir boys and they're in the back rooms like bankrupting people and getting them to sell their houses and mortgage them to buy this mastermind coaching thing. And then these people aren't qualified. They just got sold and they lose their houses and they lose their, you know, they get divorced. They just, it destroys them. people suicide, like it's. Yeah, really.
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
horrible thing and they're out here like I'm the greatest thing in the world and people are literally worshiping them and It's really disgusting So yeah, that's why I have my pros and cons because there's a bit of a bro culture, you know Alex from Ozzie and who he attracts, right?
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I don't want anything to do with it I almost even don't study it because I look at it and then as soon as I hear like The things that he has said he's like, yeah I was willing first of all he lied and he admitted to lying and he was like whatever it takes to make the money and He said different things I'm like you told me enough to know that you have no integrity that Selling is the bottom line and that you can't be trusted Why would I listen to you that that makes no sense? want nothing to do with pretty much everybody in this world Or they're all about and hub and yeah, just go park it over here And I'm just like I there is a group of people that you know, and it's not the super religion disorienting, but it's the conservative. Like, I want to make money. I do love marketing. It's exciting. But I don't want to be slimy about it. And I don't want to be condescending. And I don't want to sell a grandma out of her home or a dad out of his retirement or, you know, all that kind of thing. And there's particular language that's used in a particular vibe, energy. And I'm in that world, but I'm not of that world.
00:23:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what mean? Yeah, exactly. No, I'm the same. Yeah. What do you want to do?
00:23:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want to open up a Google Doc and start mapping out? Yes. So you now is the thing that you were looking at today, the YouTube stuff relative to what what we were doing. Does it have any bearing in terms of like creating an offer or structure?
00:23:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
we'll open up the Google Doc. think you started one, right? It might as far as The initial part of the YouTube video was kind of interesting how they just decided to throw up a 5K offer that really wasn't really created yet, but they were always one week ahead, right, and but they made sure they treated the customer like gold so they got what they want. So, it probably was your typical thing of they, I mean, it was all in German, right, so I don't know what the inside of the school program is, but it was probably definitely all about having a good offer building an audience, you know, having accountability. That was one thing that was intriguing. They offered a weekly accountability person or no daily, I think, so we could have Sally check in on them every day if we wanted to, you know. But yeah, yes, so I mean I can take a look at this off.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I've got Stephanie Stephanie's $30 an hour and that's mostly because it's partially benevolent and she needed and I believe in a button so I don't do that but she could help with that too.
00:25:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, and, and, or even down the road have a I be that person right that yeah, I'm trying to get my documents alone.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:25:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure. Yeah.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mama, I'm a bear marketing that one. Okay. Let me share. Okay. That's weird. You just said participants can now see your application, which I've never. It's never said that before.
00:25:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just. Yeah. Oh, yes.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't really have. Um, the offer, I put it, it was in, I think I just set it in box or my bad. Hold on. I don't want this.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You gonna buy another backup?
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. I think I might just pin a room like I really don't even want to do any video period, but I'm like, do you think this is upstairs?
00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two of our bedrooms are that dark blue color actually that you have.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I like these just, um, when I, when I look at, like the contrast and the energy of the light in, in some videos, I also like there was, they have this like bright yellow and I just think the energy of the bright yellow is really nice. Um, and I, I think about energy and I think about the color psychology, uh, a lot yellow is calming and trust, blue is trust also. anyway, um, see, here's your Google doc. I'm not open to that. And then also, I think it was just a voice message that I left you about what we could do or maybe we just talked about it.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know. I love it in the voice.
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I put it in a Google Doc? About the offer? Let me look at the amount of shared stuff that you shared with me. Okay. I think it was in a voice message to be honest.
00:27:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I just put a path for making $50k a month. There it is. It's a different doc. Oh, Tina Partnership. Yeah. I've been almost manic this week, but yeah, so I went there like SL, $6,000, a written custom business, ops slash system slash team plan, and a custom marketing plan. We'll create it together on a two hour call with them. We do not fulfill it. it's created, right? We don't build anything. just tell them how to do it. But then what we could do is upsell them into a group coaching where they get support or it could just not be group coaching if we don't want to have like a group offer with them and anything. But the follow up is, you know, 200 or $400 a month and I would go more with like 400 a month for ongoing support through voxer and email. So like they could ask a question and be like, I don't know what to do about this or I'm stuck. got a row of blocks. So maybe they need some brainstorming. Maybe they need us to build a formula for them to do some calculations because they can't put the things together. But what I'm thinking here is before, so we can sell it to anybody, but we'll give them some criteria for us. have to have this, right? So anything that basically spells out, you know how to make money and you're not going to risk losing your home or not beating your kids in order to make this payment and investment with us. We could do some financing offer as well, but I still would want to put this in here. And I do think we should offer financing because I think that people that we want to help most might need that kind of help. So then what we do is we have them fill out a very thorough thing form and it will help us understand what their assets are.
00:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you have that you have sold before?
00:29:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times did you sell it? How much did you make over what period of time? How did you get leads and eyeballs on it? Do you currently have, you know, a flow of eyeballs, even if it's five a month on your offer? Do you have a social media following? Do you post blogs? you have a group like all of the potential ways that you have organic traffic coming to your offer? Do you You have money for an ad budget. If so, what is it? You know, we want to be able to spend at least a couple dollars a day because we could do something with that little bit, even if it's on YouTube. Are you comfortable with making videos? Have you made videos? you have a video editor? All of these types of things, right? OK. We're going to tell them $6,000 plus. You should set aside roughly $1,000 budget for contractors and ads. So we're going to minimize everything. But I think that we could get, if we needed graphics or video editing, we could get that done. And we could give them a decent ad budget with an extra $1,000 that they spend. And so part of our marketing plan would be taking stock of what they already have and who they have, right?
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what their products are and say, OK, and we would do the same thing for them that we would do for us, which is not the best. Sorry, Chin, you want me to start writing this?
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in there because I'm not as much an auditory person like I can do whatever you like yes I do have badminton recording so um okay from there too okay okay I lost my train of thought and it's totally okay it's just the way my brain works um so so my thinking was that if we do a really um thorough written intake so if they can't express to us in writing what they have if they can't answer the intake form well we already know we're gonna have issues being successful with them okay okay um but but if they have something so we're we're going to say okay here is the most leveraged offer that we see and I would do for everybody a hard-brid thing so I would say I would um now we would do this together right and and and come to some sort of agreement kind of riff a little bit before we talk to them but I think our target should always always be help them find kind of the tier thing which is done for you done with you and DIY type of version meaning there's either a product that you buy yourself and maybe it's not done anything you don't have to do anything maybe it's just a product that you purchase but we want to figure out a value stack where there is a scaling because we want them to get their money back ASAP right and we know that the higher value things generally tend to be a bigger investment and if they were already good at packaging these things together then they wouldn't be reaching out to us so that's my premise is that they're going to need help figure out that option so then what we have to look at and is go okay what would it take to fulfill this what kind of support do you need are you going to need somebody to help you create some graphics for social media or for ads are you going to You need a video editor, know, did you because YouTube ads are going to be the least expensive if you're willing to do it and probably get you the best results in terms of getting leads. Can you write it? Do you need to go hire some copywriting help? you like some AI prompts to help you write stuff because we can help you with that? Well, um, so I think that if somebody, so what we would want to do is figure out what is the baseline of what somebody's doing like, can they, are they already generating or have they ever generated even $2,000 on selling something, selling a service or product? Maybe that number needs to be like for my clients, it's a minimum of your earning $50,000 a month and that's minimum because Even at that point generally their profit margin suck and they're not managing money. Well, it's just this weird Growth period generally it's not super optimized They hustled to get there and they're like I can't get out of this thing Whereas it's lower they're more conservative with the expenses because they need everything to count so Yes, so I thinking about what the parameters are and giving some really clear examples So a person who fits it can look at it and go yeah, that's me.
00:34:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's totally me.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh That makes sense and then so We would do a profit calculator Well Okay, so I have different versions of this and I just plug in people's numbers and There are formulas that you can do change. So I'm going to duplicate this. This was actually something I had been thinking about for myself. Um, so let's say, um, Maria, Tina, um, joint business plan, um, and offer creation. And it's 6,000. And if we sold three a month, um, then we come over here. There's no attrition. So that's just how much it would make us. But then let's say that we upsell them to, um, private access, and it's monthly and it's $400. It's those same people. So, um, oh, sorry. Yeah, sold is three. And it's price annually, price monthly, 400. And so then that would come over, I'm thinking it was wrong with that one. Yeah, price annual, price quarterly. Yeah, anyway, we'll just do it this way, 1,200. It'll go populated like it's supposed to. It's not there's something wrong with my formula. But anyway, fix the formula. But we could do something like this with them and show them, OK, here's all you have to do. And so you play around with prices a little bit until you get a number over here that matches what they needed to be. And the first target is going to be how much money they need to make. And the second target is going to be how do they see how their investment in us has returned to them. At the very least, they should make their money back. But, you know, we'd like to at least double their return on investment and that shouldn't be hard if we're selecting the right people and just giving them the value is the clarity and the confidence. So most of the time people have stuff and they're like, yeah, but I don't, should I do this? Should I do that? And so they're not clear. And when they make a decision, they're still, I don't know if I should do this. I'm picking something. And so they hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, they don't pull the trigger, they do it and they're like two days later, it's not working and they abandon ship and they go do something else. They don't have confidence, but you can't abandon ship. It takes weeks most of time to get an offer to convert, get the ads to work well, to dial the audience in that type of thing and start actually making money. It can be different, it depends on where you're running ads, depends on how good your ad is, depends on your offer, it depends on your pricing. along all of these different things. But on average, I would say roughly around six weeks before you really get some kind of traction. So anyway, and so we can look at the different things that they offer and say, okay, so here's where people come in, and maybe it's a $5 offer. How many people do you need to make X? And if that conversion rate percentage is 2% up to the next offer, then at this price point, how much does that make? That type of thing. I've seen you do those types of numbers in your posts, but this would be something where we clear it and we'd make all the formulas correct and make sure that they're working. And so like lead magnet here, leads per month, let's say it's 500 eyeballs on there, cost per lead is, we'll say it's $2, convert to product, we'll say it's, so if you did a $3 offer, you got like 50% right?
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Conversion was 20%. Well, it's 29%.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
29%. Price of product was $3. And so average cost probably, why not? I definitely average value per lead. Oh, yeah. So if they upsell, but then you had a $25 offering and more converted to that, right?
00:39:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Well, the average order value one day or value was about $30 as well. But then within 30 days, like they're on a thing to buy a $1,000 or $4,800 thing, but we've never ran it long enough to calculate, you know, what the conversions were on that.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So there are some things missing in here because I was doing it as an exercise and then I stopped, but we could create something like this where we screen share and we walk them through and we would populate it with information from their intake form. They already told us about their products and they already and we would have gone and looked at them So we'll do a little research before getting on the call so that we can make that two hours and be done We're done.
00:40:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah Well, I walk people through on today's it's okay if I share screen.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, me stop. I'm sure what I got I walked through and maybe we make an amalgamation of stuff But I walk people through today like a customer journey map, right? Like and actually was giving examples one was even yours PTM Maximizer and say you offered a six and six score of six figures six months. Okay, whatever free school please example and I share with them my you know journey map here, but then it goes into a Like this is rated live on the call with one of the people today So then it goes into a value ladder like this kind of a high-ticket ascension thing from low ticket So yeah, so her case it wasn't free. This is this was your micro offer So basically, where's your micro offers? hers was Facebook ads for financial advisors, let's say it's 1440, and then what's your order bump? 27, it doesn't have to be in order but this could just be upsell or whatever. So maybe that's better if I just say upsell, upsell one. And then I'll just, just for the remedy, I'll just take up 100 deals, pack of the safe proven, Facebook and IG proven templates. And then I asked her what does she want next, her lifestyle? Cause she does have a hot done for you stuff, like, but she said, I'd like to select her 1000 of course, that's more passive. So yeah, let's create the 100K scale fast systems on nine seven. So then it fills all this, populates this out, right? So did you build this? Yeah. Nice. So yeah, and also I have a whole ad challenge calculator, all that stuff too. then here if we work backwards so let's work backwards how much do we really want to make and she said she wants to make 15 grand a month so okay so we weren't just played to the numbers everything in blue is what you change so well let's say um you want seven sales of a thousand and and that's almost 7,000 here right let's just for easier number let's change just a thousand so i'm a graphical person right so i like seeing graphically what it is uh oops i love that so step 300k skills this is so so say we got seven sales that's seven grand and then okay well how what's the agreement going to be of the people that bought up cell one um it could be of people who just bought the micro carbon can skip step two but i like to have it up so on yeah so so this is five percent so so so in order to make 7,000 here we need 140 people here right the five percent and then that's um you know total revenue here would be 380 because the Facebook and IG templates was 27. could always change that price point and that changes this too. And it's like, okay, what's the conversion rate, people for $27, people who bought the $14, you know, Facebook ads for financial buyers, what's the conversion rate needed? An order of $1 should convert at 30 to 50% or else you're bad, you know, and an upsell should convert at about 30%, especially since it's only $27. So, 40% is very, very conservative. That's going to bring in this money and then how many, you know, sales of this micro-off you need 350 sales. So, that's a 10% conversion rate because it's only $14. Again, this could change drastically if it's like 3%. So, that's for $15,000. So, how many page visits do you need? $3,500. I have a whole ad calculator. Basically, if you're paying, say, this could be all organic, first of all, or joint ventures, know, people have your email. I'll give you a 50% commission on the front end or whatever, or it could be, hey, you're paying a dollar or $2 per click, then you can figure out your ad spend as well. So still good. If you're paying $2 per click, $7000 to double your money when it's almost passive. That's cool. So that's what we have. then like when we do it list, so moving is something pretty like this. I did your PT maximizer, say, okay, you have a school. So, so, uh, 100 days to 10k. So no less up that one. Is it here? Yeah. So I was like, okay, your value ladder was you had a school group, and you have a private time energy maximizer, 20 bucks, and then you've got 6,000, you know, 6,000 a third course and that 6,000. So wherever the course name is, right? So, so two sales, you know, that's that's 12 grand, say 5% of the people to buy profit time energy maximizer. buy it. So the thing that's wrong with this is that you could skip this middle one and just have two steps. Like, so 5% of these people, 267 people buy it, right? But anyway, say you have a 15% of your free school community buy your $20 thing, then you only need 267 people in your free school community to produce 12,800 a month, sort of. Anyway, so yeah. Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. Yeah. Video came back and I'm like, oh, I just moped.
00:45:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. But I guess the biggest thing is, so what's the promise?
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, always work backwards.
00:45:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, we're going to learn each other how we each work. But what's the ultimate promise? We're giving them like, for these guys, they're promises like five figure months, right? So in a six week course, they gave them all the tools to create test optimized. They had a community. Coaching forward to our calls a week, which is a lot. I wish they had accountability. Again, accountability partner who supports you on a daily basis, support by the community and chat. But there was no done for you stuff there either. And if we come back to, there's.
00:46:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's two articles one on one or group group.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was the price? Yeah, group.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. What was the promise?
00:46:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You. They, they kind of are promising. So here they're levels. They have the free community. They have this mission five, six weeks. A self-employed person, you can grow your monthly sales in a relaxed manner to five digit figures. So they're promising five figures a month, whether it's 1000. Wait, no, is that 10,000? so 10,000. Yeah, they're promising 10k months then. Actually, their YouTube video was called YouTube. They had a YouTube. to video. I think it had the word 10k in it. Yeah, become part of the school revolution, learn how to easily make 10 to 15k a month with one hour day. That's, that was their promise.
00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I think that the promise is that we cut your time to actually launching your products like by 80 or 90 percent and actually make sure you do it with clarity and confidence. Because if you're trying to come up with a business plan yourself and figure out the offer, the offer is one of the hardest things for people to figure out, to figure out the price points. We could offer, so not only the offer but the hook, right? Because it's going to happen in our heads where we're going, this is why somebody would want to buy this. So the hook for the coffee is going to come out. The USP is going to come out.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We will help you define your USP.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We will help you define, so in your offer, that's going to be the price points, the potential order bump, upsell one, upsell two, so an entire value stack, as well as a way to create where possible. We have to put a caveat, a recurring subscription revenue, MRR for you. There is no, we can't guarantee you're going to make sales. Now we can also offer to create an ad set for them, just some really basic stuff. You've got Canva skills, I've got Canva skills, we've got people, when you put the hook, like we have some kind of templated meaning, I mean, there's just a really basic thing, there's the kind of glory shot, there's a picture of whatever the product is, or a screenshot of the result, or it depends. and all of the product is by far, right? And then a headline and then a call to action. We could do that in our sleep. So we could just go ahead and create it. We could have some different Canva templates or get a low cost person to do this for us and build that in, right? So we're gonna invest maybe bucks having so many creative graphics. But ultimately we should have somebody who's working for us build a library of ad graphics that we can use and just rotate through, changing up the color scheme, dimensions, things like that, depending on the platform. We would also give them channel marketing, channel advice, right? Here's how you put this up to Instagram. Here's and we would tell them, so like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and then Twitter, potentially LinkedIn, depending on who it is. And, basically say, okay, here's the version of the content that you use for this, this, this, and this, give them advice. And that's it. We're structuring everything for you, but also, so a lot of times, people are like, oh, I can't. I don't have anybody to help with this. I don't know how to we'll write a copy for you. You and I can rip copy out, but it is correct. We can recommend copywriters to you so you get access to our Rolodex, right? We'll introduce you to somebody to hire for copy for graphics, for video editing, for any of the things that you need. So you get our our service provider, Rolodex. And then, like, so now you have of a plan by two marketing and business mavens with a combined nearly 60 years worth of experience in business and a top level experience, making a lot of money and in a sustainable way and integrity. Right? So we've seen we've both generated millions for others tens of millions of hundreds millions from over a million for myself personally while barely working really and taking care of my kids. So what we're doing is in the matter of two hours taking all the stuff that they've had and they've been thinking about and will create multiple versions of the offer, right? Because you're The document, the calculator that you just had did that, mine does it where you can kind of mix and match, like here's the different things that you can offer. Some people will take this, people will take that type of thing, so a different kind of offer stack. We could help them define their avatar so they know who they're marketing to so that they can dial in their messaging and get really clear on their messaging. It's probably too expensive for us to pay for a similar web, if we have a few people buying this, I would love to have an account of similar web and look at their competitors and figure out how they could stand up there.
00:52:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me ask you a question, why do you like similar web so much versus just doing like a typical, like, like, I And I'm just riffing with you here because you can see where they're paying for ads that you can't necessarily see in a Google search.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like there might be a place that they're running ads and spending a lot of money that you can't tell on a Google search, which means your buyers are there and you know that because because I tell them to do a abundance analysis right where you just competitive analysis, basically, where they I line competitors, what their headline headline benefits are, but I get what you're saying, so they know that that's great too. And it's probably better for somebody who's got a lot more money to spend and who can go, you know, spend money in these areas where it, but it's basically just a potential pools of customers that you can't identify.
00:53:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's not just who your competitors are and what their offer is, but it's true.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are they getting their customers from?
00:53:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's really just market research, but yes, yeah, so and we would do that ahead of time and bring that to them to the call We wouldn't spend our time doing research on the call what we would do is show them everything that we came up with and Spend all the time making sure that they're really clear on what we figured out Hmm, I think we could do that in an hour of our own time before the calm. Yeah so They're coming away with like I can do this and then though so We would recommend and say 90% of people are going to want the follow-up because you're going to have questions and You know, this is a this is the plan, right? is $6,000 is plan It's not the support, but the support is only $400 a month and you get access to us through water If you want another call, could have all a cart kind of price for getting on a call with us. That needs to fall within our effective hourly rate of time that we're willing to do. Because the difference with the call is now I have to block off time on my calendar and we have to coordinate, whereas with Boxer I don't have to do that. So that is why Boxer can be so inexpensive. But they get the same quality really. You don't get the feeling of they've got us on a call and we've locked up our time. We have to tell them we can't make a promise that you're going to get your money back. You can make a promise that you're going to have experience that is worth the money. Because everything that we're going to teach you about your own stuff, about the offer, about how to launch it, about how to pay for support. who, who to get support, we can even make that connection, we're going to save you more than $6,000 worth of time. So let's say your effective hourly rate, theirs, so let's say $6,000, is divided by $50,000. would be 120 hours. And if you think about that, you know, somebody's, how many months do people generally spend before, like, while trying to think about product and put it together. If they actually even launch it, could Karina have launched the stuff that she did without you? right, okay. yes, we're going to show that, but we're also going to show what are the odds of and the statistics of my daughter. Also, I just realized I am missing, I just missed a train. Oh, no, did you go to it? No, I need to do this. But. I can't see the doc now so I lost my train of time.
00:57:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm going to reach, reach, get, get, go.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, yeah. statistically, most people will. Hum and ha about trying to create an offer and it can take them years. To launch something. So they generally make their money. Just kind of hustling. And it's not a well thought out offer. It's not scalable. It's not evergreen. So they're constantly launching thing after thing hustle after hustle. They end up taking clients that they don't like just to be able to get by. And they're doing it alone. And they don't have the feeling of experts have given you validation for your offer. And I helped you structure it. Like where else are you going to get to like time tested experts who. Like, my clients pay me $1,000 an hour, they're getting two hours, but they're also getting a very specific plan and your time, and we're going to spend time doing our research and preparing for what we ever get to the call, so it's not just two hours of our time, you know, we get on a call.
00:58:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, get it.
00:58:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, so.
00:58:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It sort of reminds me a little bit of, um, do you remember, did you want redend Kennedy's books ever and stuff?
00:58:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, no, I hear about them all the time. It's not audio, so I can't say, but I can't read anymore very long.
00:58:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, yeah, he was like, who I learned marketing.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
from ages ago, probably 25 years ago.
00:59:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he used to have, and I doubt if he doesn't anymore, because he's like, yeah, he's probably tired now, practically.
00:59:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's all his stuff.
00:59:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They worked together. You didn't know that? Yeah, yeah. No, you bought his stuff.
00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But like, I don't think he's like working every day anymore stuff.
00:59:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he was like, his peak was 20 years back to him by now. That's right. That's right. Yeah. His peak was 20 hours, 20 years ago. Sorry, but yeah, he would have a diagnostic day where he charged 18,000 for a client to come in and spend the whole day with him. And he would map out their entire plan. if he wanted Dan or his team to build it, then that would be another fee, but he would reduce that fee by 19,000 that you paid.
00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so maybe then we build in the voxel support, because again, it gives us some freedom and maybe it's for 90 days. if you want more time after that, that way the support is built in.
00:59:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's not a sticker shock price kind of thing.
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay so and it kind of stacks in the value right so it's more of our time um And it shouldn't be more of a commitment and I would want to make sure that they're being successful and And getting through it and maybe after we do a few of them we can figure out how to restructure it um I don't know.
01:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are your thoughts? I like it because you're right you you this is something you hit nail on the head If I were to share the screen, but I know you better go soon, right?
01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
many more minutes do we have until till 10?
01:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
already missed this training, but I'll I can watch the recording. Okay, so um They are constantly launching thing after thing because they're hustling and taking clients just to get by And they are feeling alone like that. think Is the most emotional aspect of it because that is probably so many people there and that's me too You know, um It's why I spent two thousand dollars in a micro after thing. And I'm very good at this.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I need help that much. Then I'm just like, no brainer, take my money. You know, there are other people. And so, yeah.
01:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and it's bespoke. Like we can kind of make it bespoke because we're not saying, well, correct me if I'm wrong, you're not thinking of the path that we're building a micro off of them, right? Like it's whatever fits their needs, right? So it's bespoke because it could be a via self funnel. It could be just a YouTube video. Like, I don't think I shared with you, but one of my friends, Carrie's doing the most amazing thing. Well, is it it's okay if I digress to another avenue, but it's just good data point for what we're teaching. So, Carrie is a guy that paid 15 grand to Ravi Abubala to scale his company. He teaches a clean business opportunity, which is meaning he teaches people how to start a remote cleaning business and he's the real McCoy. So I was this customer services manager at where Avi's company, this is a few years back. And Kari asked for a refund. He's pissed off because he's just like, you guys just want to throw Facebook ads at this to be self on it. But I'm telling you, organic LinkedIn is what worked for me. How come you're not teaching really much? He's like, the only person that ever added value here in this company was Maria. You know, so we kept in touch, right? We're good friends. And also he's, he's, he, he of went down a dark hole after that and just took a off and just, you know, he's very Christian as well. So he, that's why we stay in touch. And he was, anyway, it was all good. But to make a long story short, he just continued his organic thing and he goes, we're out. So six months ago, I'm just going to do TikTok and I can't believe in 30 days. I actually made more money than the last six months. He just went live every day on TikTok, just talking about, yeah.
01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
me tell you what I'm wrong.
01:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think we should do that. I think so too. And then with that, well, this is where it gets interesting. With that confidence that he built and probably got boy in bed, Messer, he then went. to YouTube but not post every day or maybe not even every week but he created the most amazing YouTube organic funnel I've ever seen and he shared it with me. It's a like hour-long training but it's not like a webinar like traditional five-step webinar this is what you do the bold prompt of a lot. It was pure teaching but this is where his magic comes in. He shows his face and he's talking the video, hey look this works for me. I'm doing this is how much money making. I've all these other testimonials people doing really well with it so let me just walk you through how to start your own remote cleaning company. He goes and he opens up a Google Doc and he's got all the steps and the words to it everything so it's like a business plan of how to start a remote cleaning company and he goes listen I'd love to share this follow-along document with you underneath this YouTube video in the description just click on it all you have to do is enter your email and you will get this like he gives away the document right and then of course he's under on the thank you page giving the document click here for the Google Doc. Actually, it's a notion template underneath it. He says, if you'd like to call for me to help you with this, you know, we do have a course for this. So it was a very, very pure value, so many comments on that video saying you're the first person that's done a YouTube video or a webinar that's actually given value, this is so valuable, I can go off and do this on my own even without you, but, and then people go with him. So he's now selling a $10,000 a day to 5k packages a day through this organic funnel. Now he's going to add more fuel to it by doing Instagram lead ads or Facebook lead ads that take him to that YouTube video, but it's that YouTube video. It's different than anybody else in the marketplace is doing. He's basically given so much away.
01:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. There's a lot of, I mean, Bob Berg talks about go giving, right, the go-giver stuff, and, the thing, and that's why I've thought about, you know, I would just give away the profit time and do max. because it teaches people what to do, but if they know that I can do that for them in an hour for free, why wouldn't they spend money with me if they've got money to spend it? Yeah. So we could do that exercise, you know, make it a video where we take somebody through it live and, you know, make it a real-time thing and offer it to somebody in the group, say, hey, this is what we want to do. want to make this a video. It's going to be on YouTube. you know, you're, you have to be willing to answer these questions. You can look at it in advance to know if you're okay with that, but this is what we want to do. And then the other thing that we could do is we could do one of these offers, free offer reasons, and do that with somebody. You know, somebody who can will take that and just like, thanks, I'll just go do it myself. Great. We don't need everybody. We don't like to force it. Well, the month, you know, so let's say 200 people see it and 196 of them do it themselves.
01:06:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And four people say, I need Tina and Maria to do it for me.
01:06:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I mean? So that's the power of abundance. And I do think that that's actually a much better model. I think that you get higher quality followers and bands that way. Yeah, I think that you they tell more people about you. And I think that's where, and also when there's this is what I know about people that have a lot of money, there's no barrier to entry and they can see everything that you know. They'll just reach out to you and they'll just say, look, I they'll offer you money. They'll say, I want to work with you. Here's a whole lot of money. Can I get some of your time because they already know, you know, and you didn't just give this away for free. Yeah. Yeah. And we, I really do think though that TikTok is the thing. I think, I think it's a fresh audience. think that are a lot of people who don't know anything about anything. So I don't think they're brainwashed. Um, internet marketers in Facebook and Instagram is the same because it's not the same. It's definitely different audience, the different people. But meta knowing what meta knows about everybody kind of puts people in this echo chamber of similarity. And TikTok is different. It's a completely separate algorithm with different data points of different, well, different algorithm. And then YouTube. So I would want to create the lives on on TikTok. And then so YouTube doesn't care about consistency. TikTok does and frequency. Very, very much. algorithms are about going live very frequently and when people are on and interacting with them. YouTube cares about how long people watch your content so quality because when they're serving up and it's just like you know SEO with Google like if you're bouncing up their pages they're not going to rank you high it doesn't matter if you stuff all the keywords in there if people aren't saying page then obviously they're not happy with what YouTube has served up and people won't stay on YouTube if they go search for something and YouTube gives them a video that's boring they don't like it whatever so they care about that you create it does not matter how consistent it just matters that the content is good yeah yeah so if we create that offer and so two videos that we could do is walk through the PTE maximizer with somebody and just gift it to somebody who has Sunday thing, leverageable, where they're like, because they're already making money. Maria, like anybody else is like, I've been doing this a while, I make money. But I don't feel like I've just like, I'm crystal clear on somebody like, I get up and I know what I'm working on every day. I don't stress about it. The money is there, money easily, even when I don't know what I'm doing, I don't spend my will too much. Because I know what my most leveraged things are. And I get to it. Because once I've learned it, I always learn it. You're not going to stop forgetting that. most people aren't that way. So that's the gift that we give somebody, but they have to have something that is clear, like a real estate agent showing houses versus making phone calls. They needed to have somebody else make the phone calls. They should be showing houses. That's like a sales call. So a salesperson doing sales calls versus writing copies. Somebody else should be writing the copy.
01:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They should be on the call because that's where the magic is.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's everything. For some people, it might just be creating videos, creating YouTube videos, creating TikTok videos. So your guy that you just talked about, his thing would be teaching and making sure that people actually know what they need to know so that they want to come and buy the things for them. So it's basically just informing his audience and that goes to people through the level of awareness by teaching them in different things about their business. So anyway, so we could create a really quality video walking somebody through that exercise and we can deal it a few times. So you've got a few different versions of the video. We can break that up into little shorts that we put on TikTok. We could break it up. We could make it a long, you know, whole-contained video on YouTube with some shorts also. And we could put it out too. We could put the bits, know, to the other platforms. I think if we focused on TikTok for live engagement, YouTube for low-cost leads, low-cost, high quality, targeted leads, think it's been very little money and do very well if we've got a great offer, and if we're demonstrating our value through the videos.
01:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, which, yeah, I always believe like the Eve Hutton thing, like when I open my mouth, they listen to me. I always know that, right? But it's just getting visible, right? Still about getting visible. So, TikTok for live interaction or engagement, as it is. Yeah. YouTube. Long-term growth. didn't even say those exact words, but something like that.
01:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
TikTok is so for low-cost. high quality leads targeted, but the content that we put there would be longer and higher value in that it's a complete picture, like girl trainings.
01:12:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so now Kari, here's his channel, Boring Business Growth Hub and Boring Business. I love that. Yeah, yeah, he's really funny. You'll love him. He's a really cool guy. Um, so yeah, so anyways, like he's he keeps pumping stuff out, but here's build, build a tent. In this video, we will overview the process of obtaining a trial. That is an ad. Hold on. A version of REX. All right, you guys. So in this video, we are going to be talking about building a. So he looks like a nice guy. He is. He created a four part series. And then if you haven't watched part one of this training, make sure you do go here. Like, so it's like a flywheel. Welcome to my YouTube channel, we show you how to build a remote cleaning business. It's just so good. his promise is $10,000 a week, by the way. don't think he has a guarantee on it anything, but he certainly has people who achieve it. But again, he goes follow along, so he goes, share the resources you will need, grab every single one of them. So he's got a follow along document here. you click here, and it comes over here, get you copy the follow along document, get my document. So we could totally create this kind of, I call it a mouse trap too.
01:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is our cheese. And I've been seeing that too, like that exactly, that's the model. And what I love about TikTok, and you can do it with YouTube too, is that we can join each other. So you can go live with another person. Because my biggest thing is I don't want to talk to myself. I don't want to talk to you, the ethers. I love to talk to Maria, and I think that we would riff so good. There might be other people that we might want to do additional conversations with them, so one great thing about TikTok is you're doing that type of thing with other people, so you get their audience, they get your audience, so if we're strategic about it and we're not overlapping the exact type of stuff, or just having abundance mindset know that it doesn't matter if we're not overlapping, because some of their people will like us better, some gave them all the gifts by letting them see that there's something else available.
01:14:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and he's making money, he says he's making about 4,000 a month now recurring, just because people are, this is his go-high level version that you know, say even if you don't buy my course, here's the booking software mandatory. cannot automate your business without it. We will use the software during the training 14-day free trial, and this is his go-high level snapshot for a cleaning business.
01:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that, and that is the other thing I want to do like I hate spending money where it's not making me money but I think that there is a lot um available in I mean go high level will pay for itself very quickly if we create our own snapshot and sell it as low cost so um I've got a girl that could help build that honestly we could probably build some of ourselves but uh and I don't know what they would be but like your micro offer whatever we come up with for these people um maybe we could say for the first um 10 people who buy this will build the automations for you in high level and if you we can put it in your own high level account don't have one get it through us yeah now we've got some people um buying it and uh so we could spend a little bit of money but we'd have the money coming in where we could spend that little bit and I've got a great girl that we could do it I have the ability to build some stuff too we can go with Dan so Anyway, we could make some money quickly with that, I think.
01:16:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think so. This could easily become, if we wanted to, 25K product, this is better than any masked maniac. I still have my friend, a frickin Russell Brunson, 25 grand for their inner circle mastermind, whatever. all they just taught them how to do a challenge, here's your challenge course, and you could get on group coaching calls, that's it.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's all they provided. said to me, what the hell? Which they ripped off of Seth. What? Which they ripped off of Seth, from Seth.
01:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, wasn't that kind of challenge. No, it was like a live, five day challenge, like I used to teach and stuff. Oh, okay.
01:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because Pedro Adao taught Russell Brunson how to do stuff, but Pedro got it from Seth.
01:16:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Pedro, well, Pedro teaches live challenges, like Pedro got it from Jason Flatt, and he got it from me. Because back 12 years ago, and. And Jason said it, Maria, you're the OG of doing challenges.
01:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You had 30,000 people go through your page. Girl, how did I never hear about you?
01:17:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, because like I didn't continue with one thing. Like I just shot an object.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did so many different things.
01:17:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's how. And so Jason created Pedro, because that was when I was doing stuff with Jason about eight years ago still. And Jason's like, Maria, I just got to tell you something. said, I'm going to help Pedro break out into the big group space, because I hate how it's all close knit group and stuff. He's done a few live challenges like you, but I know you're the OG, but he's kind of using a new modern way of Facebook groups and stuff. go, Jason, I'm using Facebook groups now too. Like when we used to do it eight years ago, yeah, we used just go to webinar. And that's it, because Facebook groups didn't exist back then. But I was, oh, I didn't realize that. But Peter had already paid Jason like 25 grand to get coached on it. So Jason then introduced him to all the other people. So I'm like, oh my God. So that's how Pedro got all the big name clients.
01:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
initially to and then that success breeds success right so we had this first few wins big name points and yeah yeah so there is and and to me this is not a shiny object again I like multiple options first of all because I do so it satisfies the shiny object by having different things I could bounce to but they're all within the same room so we could do a challenge around an offer like your marketing offer and we could teach people to do what we're going to do for somebody else right so if you want to put your own brain power in it but if you've got enough money that you would rather us do it so that you're really confident you did it right yeah and you want that one-on-one time because I would do that I don't I don't want to be in the group I don't want to have the group conversation not when I have money buy of money I just want to get it done fast right so some people don't have the money but they need the path and and that would be you are kind of give back thing. We put them through a challenge, sell it cheaper, but it's the same thing we're doing. So we're not jumping around from type of offer to type of offer. It's all about get started, get clear, and leverage and optimize your offer for a sustainable business that you keep running. It's an evergreen offer. So back to the fundamentals, like we're not here if you want to do launch after launch after launch after launch. You have to have something of value that has lasting quality and value. If you want to do the launch fine but we're not talking to you about that, we're not suggesting it because that's rework, then you're building yourself into a job of having to come up with the next thing. We don't advise that. That's hustle and grind mentality that will take a toll on your health, mentally, physically, emotionally on your relationships, and we don't. on anything to do with that. best of luck to you. Bye. Yeah. Um, now, if you would like to build a business that can support you, that can allow you to fill your purpose in life and serve the people that you feel called to serve, but be able to make money where you're not stressing about it and worrying about it. And then build something that has a compounding benefit where you're earning more month over month, year over year. Let's talk. Here's the system for that. Here's what you need to know, figuring out how to make it work takes a while. So, you need emotional support. That's what the group is for. You need structural support. That's what our plan is for. And then you just need to keep on keeping on until it works. And we've got the experience to show you what happens if you get stuck in a pitfall and you can come to us for help. That's what your money goes for.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just create, you just take that part of the recording.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the manifesto.
01:21:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. It's awesome. I loved what you said when you feel called to serve. So I love it. That's a good way to end this call. know you got to go.
01:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So okay. So I get you supposed to so happy. I feel like our calls are so productive and we get a little bit clearer, but I also feel like we're going to give so much to people anyway.
01:21:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what are the next steps? you want me to put together like a small offer dock and then you just go at your magic and just revise it and stuff?
01:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be the best thing for me. if we were to like this, that would be great.
01:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it comes out of me verbally, very quickly and pretty clearly.
01:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Putting it onto a document for whatever reason, generally I will pause. But if somebody starts the document, then I'm like, oh no, this, I did this. And then the structure gets really clear, really fast. And then we pick steps, tasks, assignments, due dates, execute, and then voila.
01:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So I'll do that this afternoon. I'm just going to go and pick up my dog. And then I got my nails appointment and uh no I love it because because then we literally probably could launch this early next week like um I mean if we get it done earlier Friday Saturday we could but I think I'm traveling this weekend I'm going go see my sweetheart and he's taken to me to a football game so I'm I'm being out of pocket for a few days or not see your sweetheart what he doesn't live where you live where does he live no he's in Arizona Vegas he's got a few different houses but generally Arizona Vegas gotcha gotcha I used to have a house in Arizona Vegas in my real estate days when I was flipping luxury homes um so okay so is Monday feasible if you want to do what's um Monday's always kind of rough for me anyway because I have a lot and I'm not getting in until like one o'clock in the morning so let's do Tuesday okay that's cool and what we can do uh yeah so I'll start on the google doc and we'll just refine it refine it and uh this will be some gosh I'm even thinking maybe I think, well, so a lot. We got to maybe limit it so we make sure that it's good.
01:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As we get clear on it, once you set an intention and you get really clear on it, people magically and it's not magically, it's synergistic, and I think it's God. But it's asking you shall receive, and you can call it lot of attraction, doesn't matter, once you get clear on it, things just start happening. So if somebody comes along and you're like, I have this perfect offer for you, and you're want to sell it, just sell it, and then we'll fulfill it and we'll figure out the details. I'm just saying, in that amount of time, knowing you and the conversations that you have and because we got clear, there may come an opportunity where you're just like, I could sell this to this person right now, sell it, get paid, we'll fulfill it, we'll deal with money up later.
01:23:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Yeah. And then also just go back to the thing about Seth and this counseling, yeah, like I know my friend Cindy Mulcaney, she loves Seth and I I remember she thought Seth's thing, that's why I bought it. And she said she was going to see that's an interesting person for me to reach out to. She never launched it. Like, she wanted to launch the thing like Seth. And she's doing other stuff, don't be wrong. She's making money and doing good stuff. But I just got a feeling it's like her, that would be a perfect client, too, because it's like, I mean, it launched it. Like, you said you're going to do it. You bought one Seth thing, all excited about it. And instead, she went all down the path of the AI, which is still good. And she's offering some kind of AI coaching offer, and a go high level affiliate. But still, it's sort of like, you know, she believed in something and then she never launched it. So what happened? we're here to go in for helping people in between that.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I think that's the issue. So people have been Yes, it is. It's doubt and it's too much work, and I need help. I don't know how to hire people. Seth can't hire people. Seth cannot manage a business.
01:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He can't. He will never happen.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not talking bad about him. His genius is just he cannot, will not do it. He will jump to all kinds of other things in order to avoid actually structuring things. And he doesn't even know where to start. And so literally saving him. And we don't, we see people like that and we don't know because we see their strengths. But that's the truth is that most people are thinking and so beneath their potential because they need support of some sort. So here's, we could do $10,000 done for you. And here's why I think that would be a good thing. We could take that money, put it into getting support in a person building an automation. But then we're building a snapshot at the same time that we own. So we give them their version of it and then we keep a generic version of it. Doesn't have their copy, doesn't have their anything. But, so I don't think we build too much work for ourselves if we do that for you, because we can whip out, like I can write copy, we could just literally talk about an offer, the copy will come out of my mouth.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm pretty sure you could do the same thing if we do some research.
01:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we would literally just have to transcribe it and then go have it edited into it, it'd be so easy. We could do the same thing with the email follow-up sequences, like we could spend maybe 10 hours for $10,000, you and I would both be well paid. You'd have enough money for a couple of months, comfortably, well, if you got it all, if you didn't, we have it one month and we could sell anyway. So I'm just telling you, those are some options to think about, because I know you know people, and I think God is going to give you, I think he's going to show you who you need to talk to and who you can help. So, you're not allowed own. You're not doing all the work. You're not going to be overburdened. If the person that you know needs this is available, sell it, take the money, get paid, know that you're taking terms, we will fulfill it very quickly.
01:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. Okay, let's go. So, send me the recording when it's ready, when I have time, that'd be great. So I could take a look at the notes and I'll create the Google Doc. I'll have that done by the end of the day today for sure. Okay. have to craft it, not like done done.
01:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will go to do that right now and then launch my missionary meeting because this is devotional so I want the prayers and all that goodness.
01:27:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. All right, all right, talk to you later.

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

I will text her real quick and see. Oh, well I said it was little don't I see it.
00:00:34 - mark sweet
For easy like how important it is to go and meet the doctors face to face. It does take a lot of time, but especially in other states.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:46 - mark sweet
Yeah, it makes a big difference because there's more and more of these California firms just like going through or doing what they're doing and just trying to separate ourselves little bit and put a case to a name and whatever. I think it spends some time with them because the people generally like me a lot once they meet me.
00:01:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've noticed.
00:01:09 - mark sweet
Yay.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's our trauma. I admit.
00:01:20 - Chona Sweet
What? Hi.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:01:23 - Chona Sweet
I was in Google. don't know what happened.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's um Um, sometimes the the events just have it there by default. Um, if I and if I'm not careful and don't delete it.
00:01:39 - Chona Sweet
So oh, uh, yeah.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've had zoom issues all day. I literally just got it installed and marking it like 601 and had to uninstall it after fighting with it. So I'm audio only today. um, yeah. Okay. Let me go to my notes real quick. Oh, it was good. I've been exhausted all week after just getting back late and then taking my daughter to seminary. then this morning, she wakes me up at 4.53 a.m.
00:02:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
she's like, mom, I'm late for seminary. And I get up and I'm like, my heart's racing and everything because I'm like, oh, I slept through my alarm. And then I look at the clock and I'm like, you don't go for an hour.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there was no catching up on sleep.
00:02:33 - Chona Sweet (3)
I tried to with their like little tiny windows here and there.
00:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm just like, yes, that's been fun. But she's doing good. So anyway, how's your charting been going?
00:02:46 - Chona Sweet (3)
It's, you know, it's still a challenge, but I feel like I'm getting better. I feel like it's really yeah. It's still a challenge.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a work in progress. Whoa.
00:03:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
show me explain to me what's getting better um i don't wait maybe more than two days to chart so i guess that's a like an improvement i thought you told me you were gonna do your charting at the same day yeah it was getting difficult um how many people are you seeing each day so like um yesterday it's just telemedicine but two days before it's um i have almost almost 35 and 90 i would say 80 percent of that is like new patients because of the new contract we have like influx of new patients and yeah did you just tell me you saw a 95 patients on one day no no no no I said 90, 80%, 30 plus patients, actually I feel like it's more than that I have to count because it's like 18 in the morning and I think I have almost 20 in afternoon and like 80 plus or 90% of that are new patients. So when it's like new patients I was just a lot more charting because they're new.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average length of time to chart for a new patient?
00:04:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
I honestly do not.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I don't really time it but that's the first thing that we need to do. And so here's what I'm to tell you, Chana. I said it in the beginning but now you're getting to the point where like we can really kind of feel it. This is tedious.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
in the beginning, right?
00:05:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is tedious in the beginning. But if you will do the things that I ask you to do, we will get through the tedious faster than any other way. So timing yourself and observing the things I'm going to ask you to observe is adding tedious on top of tedious. But the fastest way for me to help you systemize and simplify what you're doing and to speed it up. Is to be able to understand what the baseline is first. Yeah, and I can send you notes at the end of this too.
00:05:40 - Chona Sweet (3)
Let me go make sure my note taker is working because I feel like it's definitely more work for new patients. I definitely find myself. So, you know, getting, you know, I'm trying not to, because I'm trying to, I know it's going to be all hard work. It's just that I feel, I know early on that when I get busy with the PI stuff, I know which one to cut. And I don't, and I know, when I say I have to cut means, I know what to tell Dr. E, which one I don't like.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you mean, like between what you're doing in PI stuff?
00:06:42 - Chona Sweet (3)
No, because the PI stuff, because it's like, remember the one, two, three, I'm on number one, which is the main word. And out of the number one, there's three categories, I guess, if it says that, first it's the hottest. Hospital rounding and I haven't even get to that because I have yet to get the privilege from the hospitals So there's one the second one is the clinic work, which I Don't know I guess from the beginning. I already know that I don't like clinic Mm-hmm, but the clinic setting are like the bread and butter of a Pain clinic basically, so that's where the bulk of our patient population is and that's where the Remember if you if you remember the the contract that I was saying that he the doctor He recently acquired that's where the majority of patient will be and then the third category is the telemedicine Which is you know, just how it tells tell them medicine phone call, but it's best basically medication refill or ordering other treatments for the patients. And yeah, so the number one cat, a number two category of seeing patients in the clinic is my least favorite because I feel like it's just more work in terms of charting. Seeing patients in the clinic, it's not my favorite thing ever since I become a nurse, I don't like clinic work, maybe because of the charting and I mentioned before to you, I really don't like writing a lot, but the hospital setting is very much focused charting. I think that makes sense, oh, the patient have pain here, it should be the same, but for some reason that clinic charting has more charting and it's just annoying. However, I know that the PI or the pain or the personal injury cases are considered clinic patients, but obviously I feel that I'm putting a lot more effort on the PI clinic patients if that makes sense. Yeah. And I'm trying not to in a way because I don't want to be that person that I have to take care of the patient more because I'm getting paid more on it, you know, but I talked to Mark about this the other day and I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me, but I know it's the reality of the situation and not just me. I'm sure everyone that gets paid more on PI patients, you know, day. It kind of like I have to give a little bit more I Just work on it.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just find myself catering to them more and Kind of don't like it in a way, but at the same time I do I the reason why I said I don't like it I want to treat everyone the same I guess that's why I'm trying to say okay so Let me ask a few questions and figuring this out will It'll take a while it'll it'll take multiple conversations, which is gonna take multiple weeks But what do you like about your job?
00:10:43 - Chona Sweet (3)
I like when Ever since I become nurse it's been typically A management, which was 11 years ago. I like that I Work as an NP, which is a different level of autonomy As compared to being an RN, a bedside nurse, I like that I can give what I think would help with the patient. I can order it right away and I can see the results right away, of like ABC type. I like that. And then lastly, I like it when a patient with, you know, the instantaneous gratification of saying thank you because it helps them. Eventually, the most difficult one is in the pain population, they're one of the most difficult ones because there's a lot of, I feel like, negotiation skills that I'm doing, you know, like, I can't give you more narcotics, but trying to convince them that narcotics is not the only treatment, there are other treatments. It's difficult, but it's fulfilling once they've Realize it themselves.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so like what, what kind of treatment do you suggest? I'm like sure you have all kinds of different types of pain and levels and options. But what are some of the non narcotic options that you suggest?
00:12:21 - Chona Sweet (3)
So like, um, I guess I'll talk to it based on my experience. I can do things like my experience in the hospital, which is the bulk of my experience. Because I work in a hospital, you know, as a pain and P is in the instantaneous result of I can order IV tylenol and some people don't even know that exists or IV magnesium or IV vitamin C for pain. And some people would not even think that even helpful. Yeah. Um, or even can. I mean, ketamine is anesthetic, it's not narcotic. So that's why I like hospital setting a lot. It's very instantaneous that there's more access. I just realized that just now, maybe that's the reason why I like hospital setting more. But now doing the clinic setting, while I'm awaiting to work in a hospital, like doing the clinic setting, I feel like I'm limited in a way and it's geared towards more intervention type procedure, which I was not, that's a new thing for me. Anything like if the patient has back pain and they will look at the MRI and see, oh, you have stenosis, you have narrowing on the disc and that's why the PT medication doesn't work for you. So we may recommend you to have an epidural which is done by the anesthesiologist. So notice that that thought process is very much common in the clinic setting, and that also correlates with PI patients.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and so do you imagine that there's a path where you can understand the nuance of the clinical setting and so I understand that the limitations that you have access to options in the hospital that you don't have access to in the pain clinic and when you know that something could be really helpful and it doesn't require an invasive procedure and it doesn't require a narcotic which comes with all kinds of other side effects and issues, dependencies and whatnot, that that can be frustrating. But do you feel like you can and work with the options that are there and just and feel any kind of like personal satisfaction, knowing that you're giving the options that maybe aren't the same as the hospital, but that you're giving the best that's available to them in the place that they went to.
00:15:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, I do. And I know that it's temporary until I have the privilege in the hospital. And I think it's designed that way to not make us feel that, you know, like just set stationary, like, oh, we're just doing clinics every day of the week, day to day. So how it's, so I in my head, it's temporary, so I understand. And I know that I need to understand the clinic culture and setting anyways, because that's how I can succeed with my PI cases, which is this, Number two, out of the three source of income. But also, there's one thing that is new, that I haven't fully utilized by myself because I'm not an experienced on it, is I can do injections on my own too. That is intervention, but that is something that I can do, and it's exciting to explore because I've done it multiple times without the E, but I haven't done it by myself. So I almost did it by myself the other day, but Dr. E is available, so I'd rather him do it with me. Yeah, well, that's in and of itself, it's a procedure, but it's not as, I guess, it's excessive like an epidural interest, yeah.
00:16:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so what we'll do every week is try to figure out what are the, Because even in the beginning while you're still wrapping your head around everything and waiting for access and whatnot, there should be something that we can do. And even if it's just a perspective shift, like earlier in the week, we talked about writing your own story, know, that what you feel like your limitations are culturally, language, that's not permanent, you know. You, there are different things that you can do, and we talked about just the practice using, using translate tools, using chat dbt, whatever to help you overcome the language barrier. And then over time, because there's, there's only so many things you're going to have to write over time. Obviously, there's a wide variety, right? But eventually the repetition is going to kick in and you're going to know the same phrasing and you're going to know it in proper grammar and you're not going to feel embarrassed anymore, and you're not going to feel like you're less than for any reason. We know that the only way that's going to happen is over time. So we can't shortcut that per se, but we can kind of expedite it with the tools that you use. And then the other thing we can do is just you just remind yourself that your story today isn't your story next year. So and kind of looking forward to that. And a year is one of my favorite perspective tools. So it's really difficult to to map out significant change when you're evolving as a person, even more so than professionally. Sometimes professionally you can do it, but the the wow effect really doesn't happen in a month. It doesn't happen generally in a quarter in the six months, but the wow effect is almost always happening. Like I've never not had that happen with anybody I'm working with in the course of a year. You look back over a year, like, that was significant, even when it's just kind of. still subtle, you can clearly see some measuring points where this was, you know, significantly different or that was significantly different and then you can kind of add in the compounding. So one of the things I just want you to do every day is remind yourself that, first of all, define and I think I asked you in text but I'm going to ask you now as kind of write down what you want this to look like a year from now. How do you want to feel about charting? How do you want to feel about the way that you write? You know, I don't love writing. I hate it. I'm 48 years old. I'm never going to love writing it and now typing but if I could just automatically download everything I wanted to say, then I'd be happy but that's not going to happen. So anyway, you know, it doesn't mean that you're going to love it or feel like you're great at it but what we do want to do. Um, is at least not feel so much resentment or frustration about it and, um, if it's one of those things we just have to bear down, then you bear down, but there are dictation softwares.
00:20:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so are you using anything to help you with that?
00:20:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah. So, um, Dr. E actually just called me today and say that, um, he bought a, the, the dragon for healthcare. They, that's what they like.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:30 - Chona Sweet (3)
but I can't use it on the apples. So, but he, he said he got me a lots of which I'll, I'll get it tomorrow. So, I'm excited for that. I'm sure I still have to be vigilant on editing it because of my accent until it, until it adopts, I guess, to my accent, but, um, I, I, you know, I, I think what I feel to do today. I feel okay. I, I don't feel like. It just waxes and wanes how I feel on, you know, feeling quote, unquote, less than, but I'm happy with what I've been doing. I mean, it's not perfect. It's a work in progress, but I, I feel like each part of the three, the streams of income, I'm working towards like the, like, I told you the Washington, I submitted that already. So I contacted my university to submit my transcripts to Washington State, and I'm happy about that.
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, that's an accomplishment. Yeah. Um, so I just did a quick Google search on how do I do new patient charting faster and I put pain clinics.
00:21:44 - Chona Sweet (3)
So the first thing I came up with is use dictation software like dragon.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other one it said was electronic health record can help you chart faster by automating tasks and allowing you to chart from anywhere.
00:21:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
And yeah, we can. Yeah, which is what I do that I feel like being having the capacity to chart at home It's a blessing and occurs in in a way to me because I feel like I Have this sense of okay. I finished seeing the patient boom boom boom. Maybe do a quick You know jot down a few notes on each basin and just tend the note and then chart at home So that means I'm finishing my work at home versus finishing it at work Which I think I should not dab it as a good as bad. It's just how it's just what I I'd rather be at home And chart at home be comfortable, but that means I'm bringing work home at home And sometimes I push the limit on maybe I can do it a little bit later and then yeah I'm up till 2 a.m. It's a slippery slope.
00:22:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so this is where you really want to define your values When when I talked about like writing your story what so this is this is not not. This is going to be an iterative process as well. So what I would like you to do is kind of map out your ideal week. Now, it's not going to be the same all the time. Some weeks you're going to have special events, trips, things that you want to do. Some days you might have an extra load of patience. days, know, we're women, there's an entire week that sometimes just feels terrible once a month. It's all kinds of things that can affect you and reduce your productivity, reduce your mental capacity. So you have to take that into account when we when we map out the ideal week. There are people that will call it like a perfect day exercise. There's no such thing, but the ideal week and you want to look at like what is your work day look like? When do you start? How are you starting your morning? do you want to feel in the morning? do you want to think in the morning? What do you not want to feel? And then a negative match list is really, really important because a lot of times it's easier to write the positive things by putting in the negative attributes. for me in the morning, I don't want to feel stress at all. It's bad for me physically. cortisol is dangerous. It's really difficult to capture goodness in the rest of the day and to be productive. But also the morning time and in the evening is when I'm with my girls the most. And so I don't want to spoil or even infect them with negative energy and stress. So I don't check email. I don't look at anything that could cause me stress. And also I'm most creative in the morning and late at night. So it's kind of the wee little quiet hours around the house. don't know if it has to do with timing or just has to do with around. But for me, those are the creative times. So in those times, I want to make sure that my schedule is not, I don't want to be having conversations. So I don't schedule calls until after 10 or 11 during the day because I want to do my creative organizational administrative tasks in the morning and in the evening as well. So I don't have calls during that time. So those are some of the things that I've figured out for myself in terms of types of tasks. other thing I've realized is that I have my best phone call time between 11 and 2, 10 and 1. Kind of depends on the day. But I want to help people. I have more energy during that time. My brain is functioning well at the time. And because of what my clients pay me, I want to give them my best brain for problem solving and also my best energy for other people's problems. So now you've got a different kind of schedule. don't have as much flow in that, but what you do have is what kind of home life do you want? What do you do anything in the evening that you want to protect? Is there a dinner time? Is there a snuggle time? Is there a you want to go for a walk? Is there a hanging out with friends? I'm like, whatever those things are, and maybe it's not the same every day, but whatever those are, you want to kind of plan how you do your charting and whether or not you take it home that night based off of the things that you want to do. And you also need to be aware of your discipline and your tendency to let the work creep into the most important things. So, and I'll tell you another kind of filtering process that I use to make some decisions, because generally the choice. that we make aren't between whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, which is easy, right? Because if I know it's bad, I'm not going to do it. But it's degrees. So a lot of times it's between good or better or best. But because you've only got 24 hours in the day, and you're only conscious for approximately, you know, 14 of them will say, allowing for the waking up and then going to sleep and actually being asleep. But and then there's only so much that you're not commuting and you're you only have control over what you're doing. If you say, if you give your yeses to the good things, to just good things, then you don't have yeses to give to the better things. And you don't have yes to give to the best things, because you're already committed by doing good. Well, it's not bad that you're doing good, but it's not the best. And you know, we get one life, we get one day at a time to do things. So thinking about, do you want to have your best day or You want to have a good day, obviously. Nothing wrong with a good day, right? But good days are just that and they're not necessarily inspiring or as fulfilling. So just kind of thinking about if you finish your charting at work, do you have your best chance at having the best night or a good night, you know what I mean?
00:28:27 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I mean our market's traveling right now, but we really are kind of like, I forgot the term used, but we like to walk at night or late at night even, like 9, 8, but I find myself charting, like if it's not here, if it's here I find myself charting. So I feel I'm not a morning person. So I like to do things in the afternoon or night time, so like the clinic work, it really starts at 9.45. So before I go to a clinic and if I have telemedicine, let's say I have 12 or 10 patients I need to call, I try to call that first while I'm at the house before I get to the clinic. And then Dr. E is like, oh it's a quick two, three minutes, four minutes phone call, but for me being new, I found myself talking to them for a longer time, that I don't think it's necessary, but I could have probably make it more necessary.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what you might do, I don't know if you'd be willing to do this, but call control skills are a big thing. I've talked to Mark about it because his people could use it. Most people don't have have great call control skills. Some people do, but it is a skill to kind of finesse a conversation and keep it on track, especially when you want everybody to feel good and you want to make sure that they're happy and they feel taken care of.
00:30:20 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, they don't feel right.
00:30:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you can to accomplish isn't whether or not they feel rushed. It's whether or not they felt heard, seen, understood, and taken care of. The timing is not relevant to them. So if you can deliver an effective conversation where they feel heard, seen, understood, and taken care of, they don't care if it took three minutes. They just care that it was effective.
00:30:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
Does that make sense?
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right. That's true. If you have the ability to record some of your phone calls and have Dr.
00:30:58 - Chona Sweet (3)
listen to them and say, Okay, what could I have? down to tighten this up then maybe he can give you a couple of scripting type ideas like say if this comes up this is what you should say if this comes up this is what you should say or he might say things like chon never ask this question because it's always going to lead to way too much like and if you deal with this type of person like i'm sure since he gave you that kind of time frame he's probably got some finesse type skills that he's picked up that he could give to you but he might not even know where to start unless he hears you and goes oh yeah here's where you're messing up and you could tighten this up does that make sense right it does um although i probably feel like in a way dr e is the quintessential doctors that are i don't know how to say it but i'm pretty sure i understand what you're saying so it's like uh you're doing good no changes oh how's your kid okay great so Let me first let me refill your medications. We'll talk to you next time. Okay, that's it. So And I feel like in a way, I feel I need to ask more. I am sure because I'm still, you know new to the group and I don't usually call patients on the phone and end up just prescribing them narcotics, whether they're on it for a long time or not. Like today, for example, I was talking to a cancer patient. Cancer patients were more lenient with narcotics, right? want them to be comfortable, right? I'm talking during the phone and she sounds very, very sleepy. And I can hear there's family in the background coaching her what to say. I said, I can hear your family in the background, I can talk to them if you're okay. with that. And so I ended up talking to the husband and the daughter. And I was very, very clear to have to be clear that, you know, if you think he's being very sleepy, do not give the needed narcotics is the last thing you want is for her to stop reading. And, you know, things like that, I feel like there's just no way around it. I just need to make sure that they understand what I'm trying to say. yeah. And then the other day, there's a patient like, I'm done talking to with her. And then she's like, oh, okay. And I'm kind of like saying goodbye. And she said, you're the first person I talked to today. I feel bad, you know.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I told her, I told her, maybe you need to go out and talk more to your neighbors.
00:33:50 - Chona Sweet (3)
I don't Yeah, those are the examples.
00:33:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I I understand that there's a reason I'm a business for myself, and I make my own roles, because I want to do what I want to do and how I want to do it. And you have to operate according to the dictates of your own conscience, but you also have to realize where you're at and what's compatible. So one of the things is that I didn't get to a place where I could be how I wanted to be just because I wanted to be there. I had to create and I paid a price. I walked away from all income while I had four daughters to raise by myself four different times. It was terrifying. At one point I was on food stands because I just wouldn't take crap from clients that it was making me unhappy. So when I say I'll pay a price, I'll pay a price that most people would never pay in order to get what I want. But that's not, you know, but there are some things that I did tolerate because I just needed to and because of the bigger mission. required it and it made me a better person because it is important I think to learn how to work within certain parameters and not just give up or want to grenade everything. I'm really good at grenading things and just be like, you know, blow it up. So there are areas I think where you you might be like I'm I have an opportunity to serve and I feel like I need to and there might be other times where you feel that you have an opportunity to serve and comfort but this probably isn't isn't the time and isn't necessary and some of the parameters might be and it's going to be hard asking yourself so the conversation with the lady who's lonely that's a that's a whole therapy session right there it is and I feel
00:36:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
Bad and to even say goodbye to her, but I redirected it in a way that gave suggestion, maybe a need to, you know, talk to your neighbors or call your family too. He's elderly. And again, I.
00:36:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to pause you just for a second because it you're not going to have the answers right away, but one of the things is you can kind of develop your own toolkit sort of thing. Right. So some of these scenarios that you run into and you know, this is going to take time. If I were to handle it the way that I wanted to handle it. But if I spend that time, then I'm going to lose my time with market nights because I have to spend more time charting because I spent too much time on phone calls. Or I'm going to be impatient with somebody else who also needs me because I spent too much time doing this and that's not fair to the next person. So there's all kinds of different reasons why it's important to. within boundaries because what they want and need most is is the medical attention that you've been assigned to give them. But what you can do is come up with some kind of scripted responses for certain types of things. So if you get somebody who's just lonely and you're working in a particular area, there might be resources that you could send to them and maybe you could say, hey, maybe you could get their email. Maybe you can just send them a letter and it's scripted and you have it pre-written. Like here are some things like I really want to spend more time talking to you, but and obviously there are probably things you just shouldn't say. Maybe you shouldn't have said that, right? You have to be careful what you say to anybody. Maybe you can say, hey, I didn't know. Maybe you didn't know about these resources and maybe it's a senior center and maybe it's a visiting program where people visit the elderly or or some sort of something where you've got a list. of resources for different types of needs that people might have. Maybe you have a cancer patient-specific type of list of resources like, hey, these are the things that you need to know and understand. For example, if they're too sleepy, here's the risks of taking narcotics. So is it more important to you that they feel absolutely no pain or is it more important to you that they live? You know, because sometimes those are the choices. again, just because I'm saying this doesn't mean that's the right thing to do. In the medical world, you have to be very careful with what you do. So I would run anything that you want to do and say by Dr. E, maybe by Mark, and just make sure that what you're doing is okay. But what I would say is try to find a way to satisfy that nurturing need that you have inside of you that loves and cares for people and why you went into that.
00:39:00 - Chona Sweet (3)
probably. I think, yeah.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also keep it keep it in perspective that if you give everything to one person, then it takes away from the other people that you're giving to you. And so kind of balancing it out and also that you can't fix everybody's everything. Right. You're not their therapist, you're not their daughter, best friend, sister, whatever. But you can be the person that takes great care of their pain and use them the resources and make sure that they know that there are other options, actually cares. Even if they don't feel that you care, Jonah, you know if you care. So that has to be something that brings you comfort too. Because if you took this outside of the pain management, how many times have you said something to someone with good intention and care and concern and they acted like you said something bad? or tried to hurt them or didn't care about them and totally took what you said the wrong way. It happens a lot, right? Yeah. Okay, so, right, so but you wanna make this personal and bigger when it happens at work because it's work and it's important and they have needs but it doesn't change the fact that people will take things the wrong way. People will get offended. People will project their other issues onto you. You have to be able to deflect that. There's no way that you're gonna be successful in this long term and be happy if you don't learn how to compartmentalize and deflect that projection and those issues that they're just not yours and it's not heartless. I'm like, I'm a bear at heart, so.
00:40:54 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. And I think it's just a matter of, I think I've been with him. for a month, but it it's only been the last week that I'm really on my own. Yeah. he, I don't know, I think he's just wanted to make sure that I'm supported and I said that I'm fine, but I do have, I still have, I still find it challenging or difficult to complete the charting each day. That's still, that's still an ongoing issue, but it's not a new issue for me, per se, like I tend to procrastinate, especially if it's something that I'm not, like, if I just, if I know I would, I'd like to do something, I can finish it in like a few minutes, if I really, really want to. So yeah, I'm gonna ask you a word question.
00:42:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you cold? I Get cold easy Okay, cuz you're hugging a pillow and I want to know if it's because they're colder because they're stressed out and it's a defense Oh, I know the pillow is my comfort. Yeah, it's comfort.
00:42:18 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah Here like if I don't feel I guess It's like comforting because of other issues like You know with my you know other Insecurities with my body when I know that that's what I thought that that was and I just wanted to check if it was You just happen to be cold and it was warm or because Yeah, but when you got it And the way that you hugged it it kind of was an indicator that that that you that's that's this is trustful little comfort it definitely might comfort and I Get Well, I feel like the body image issues one thing, but this work, I don't like it when there's no, I don't have the flow because I just don't have it yet, it's beyond my control. So until I have that flow, until I know exactly what I'm doing in a week or two weeks, I would feel a little uneasy about it. But I'm trying to control what I can't control, that's where I'm at. Learning things about the PI and just, I feel like I'm trying to do things like simultaneously.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're doing a lot right now, it's a lot to learn and it's not just a lot to learn. I would imagine there's some things that go through your head like, I don't really have to do this because you don't have to do it. It's one thing when you have to make money and take care of your family. It's just not, you know what I mean? But you have bigger aspirations and you have goals about how you want to see yourself.
00:44:12 - Chona Sweet (3)
Yeah, I definitely, you know, that's what I did the Washington right away and, you know, Mark is helping me kind of start the conversation about having clients from different chiropractors.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:44:28 - Chona Sweet (3)
I know it may not happen until early next year, but at least I get my licensure and then hopefully we can start. I guess Mark is saying that I need to have a different LLC for Washington. Oh, yeah. I don't know. But, you know, that's like one thing and I definitely need organization with my receive. I don't know. What I'm doing now is taking a picture and putting it under my favorite. But with the upgrade updates of the iPhone, like I cannot see the favorites right away So I Just need to be more organized with that. don't have a lot of You know expenses right now, but the other thing that comes up is you know, I I need There's a lot of good things happening in my life my career like I really need to take care of my my body myself So I start working out and the instructor that I mean them The instructor that's helping me she have a scheduling system that texts people and I know markets kind of working on that as well But a keyword is mark is working on it and not mean I feel like like you're waiting I feel like I cannot it appreciates me that I have to wait for him before I can move forward I trust what he says, but it doesn't mean it doesn't frustrate me. Also, I understand that I'm not ready to eat my own in that honor itself also frustrates me. I feel like, you know, in my head, I cannot be super ready for this. I know I just have to like learn as I go, and I'm trying my best to understand as much as I can. And I also understand that with me doing this affects marks reputation. So that worries me, makes me anxious, but that's a conversation I have within myself that, you know, I know I'm new, but I have, I'm not new to what I'm doing medically. So that's just, it's like just all those things that I... My question is to Mark about this and you know, I'm sure it's just that growing process of this having a new thing.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's the biggest thing is the newness of adult, everything's new. relationships are new, the processes are new, the pressure is new, time management is new, the knowledge of some of the things including business and different responsibilities. That's all new. Like you're having to wrap your head around and your body and your energy and your schedule and your routine and your mindset around all of these things all at once. And that's a lot, but you can do it. And one of the things I would love for you to do is just every day tell me something that went good, tell me something that you're proud of. So like you've got the Washington stuff done, that's great. Every day, just every work day, just send me something that you're like, I'm proud of myself for this. If you're struggling to find something like that and you tell me tonight, I don't have anything I'm proud of today, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions until we find out what your product is, because there's no way you didn't do something that each day.
00:48:17 - Chona Sweet (3)
Oh yeah, I know. I feel like I'm already proud of, I know I've been there for, I think, on my third week, I was able to get the electronic prescription that my colleagues that's been there for a while apparently took them two to three months to get while I get it in three weeks. I was proud of that. Good job. I was at the other doctor that came at the same time with me, that started at the same time with And he texted me, and he said, how are you able to get get the, the, he he he he said, He skipped fast, so I tried to help him. But anyways, I was proud of that. But I don't know if I'm too, I'm proud of how I get it, but how did you do it? So I can call them multiple times, and it's frustrating. And there's a multi-step process that they have to verify cross match with your credit score and all of that. And for some reason, they cannot verify me. So I created an email. I created a ticket. And on that ticket, I wrote a long email, basically saying that I do not understand why their company or their system cannot verify me while the other government institutions like the DEA. Okay, for the California Board of Nursing, things like that, I mentioned names, these bigger government institutions can verify me, and your system cannot.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how hard is that?
00:50:16 - Chona Sweet (3)
Well, I was, everybody, that's my favorite thing, is just be like, listen, so yeah, I kind of basically also said that, look, the way that your system is holding me back on taking care of my patients, so yeah, I was, I was initially part of it, but then I didn't know that Dr. E's manager can also see the text, and we talked to each other and she's like, man, I saw your text, I'm like, ooh, Jordan can be spicy, and it's like, I was annoyed.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, first of all, you're going to be able to take care of patients better, and maybe somebody got a little fire lit under them, they probably didn't, but You know, their apathy is a plague in almost every type of business and definitely inside of government institutions and good for you standing up, but good for you articulating. And here's the thing, because you keep talking about like what you can't do with your English and grammar and whatever, but your ability to articulate the, that's a good lawyer tactic by the way. Also, that argument was indefensible because you're like, wait a minute, like all these other people can verify me. The same information is available to you, yet you can't seem to be able to do it. I'm not going to tell you your inept, but basically I showed you your inept and also it's costing my patience.
00:51:47 - Chona Sweet (3)
Girl, I was shocked when someone responded to me via email on a Saturday. I was like, I keep on responding to them back and forth, I like caring. I try it again. I keep on trying and then I kind of said it like not ultimately but kind of I said this is the third and last time I'm going to try this. If this doesn't work your system needs to override me. That's what I said and they did. So I was actually shocked it worked but yeah.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not that's my go-to move if I have problems with people. I don't have problems with Mark because Mark is always nice and good and everything but like if I like teachers, principals, whatever somebody not handling business very well, accompanying.
00:52:37 - Chona Sweet (3)
You know what this reminds me actually and I was telling Mark this that I really wanted to become a lawyer when I was in college but anyway that's a different story.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh it's your but it fits perfectly with what you're doing because patients need an advocate and an advocate is another word for what attorneys do right. They advocate for their clients. Well, you need to advocate for your patients and that's all that you were doing as you were advocating for all of them by being able to have this process and do that so good.
00:53:10 - Chona Sweet (3)
So that what I was doing is Dr. E would let me see all his patients either with him or by myself just until I get used to it and then he has to order the medication for me and then the patient starts to get upset at me coming back or calling to the office saying you didn't set my medication but it's not my fault it's Dr. E's fault because he doesn't do it on time. So I have to do work around on that one where I said you're here, log in and I'm gonna order this and let you look at it before I send it so that's what we've been doing and I don't like that. I want to do it my own on my own my own time.
00:53:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. Okay, so here's what we're gonna do I need you to time five new patient charts. and five follow-up patient charts okay okay just do it as accurately as you can it just will give us a baseline to kind of figure out what it's doing and and we'll see what we get from there okay you're using drag and dictation that has to train that takes a little while there could be some shortcuts some abbreviations things like that it'll take a little while to figure out how to optimize your charting system as much as can be done and then the other thing the other assignment is I really want you to map out and and write out what does your ideal week look like are there particular times of the day or times of the day on specific days of the week where you're not charting you're not staying up late you're doing something else going for walks with Mar watching TV, resting, whatever, like whatever the things are working out.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet (3)
You want me to think of like in the future or my ideal in the period.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how about now like what is compatible with your life as it is right now and what you would like it to be a year from now?
00:55:22 - Chona Sweet (3)
Okay because I feel like with the Washington it's gonna be busy. That's why I mentioned once that starts and you know took off then I will have to pick and choose what I do with Dr. Lee.
00:55:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of the benefit of this exercise is that we compare it with what you actually have to do and what's actually in your life and go do these things match up so either you're giving up some of what you ideally want in order to do these other things and maybe it's temporarily or you optimize your day and your time a little bit better because you want to do the work and also you want to have these other particular times. So the biggest part is just consciously evaluating what has to be done, what is wanted to be done, and how the two are compatible and where the compromises have to happen if you're going to do it all and what compromises maybe you're just like I'm not I'm didn't sign up for this this is not what I want to do but where you probably will be like instead of that and that extreme like okay I want to do all of this so how do I get more done in less time how do I and then it probably will because you're taking a lot on figure out which things are best for you whether because it's more satisfying to you it earns more money, maybe it's something that you and Marc get to do more together of in the PI stuff, even though you don't like that, like there's all these different things that have to be evaluated and they all have different pros and cons.
00:57:15 - Chona Sweet (3)
Right. I think eventually when that time comes, and I call it as a retirement career, because I feel like I will always want to do something using money, is that I can travel, and Marc can never talk about this, I know that eventually our goal is to be able to travel and still make money. Yeah. Well, like if I do the telemedicine, even if I call a certain amount of patients finding that sweet number is the goal later on, that will still make me money.
00:57:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And when there's also point where you make enough that your money can be the way that you make your money through investments and other types of things. So if you have any type of interest in that, that's, that's, and just how long do you work? Do you want to work five years, 10 years, 15 years? How much do you want to work? How much do you want to earn? How much do you want to have in your investments making money for you? not just because it's money, but because you, you had, you wanted to feel like you did something productive and meaningful. And the one thing about earning your own money is that you feel like you can put it towards the things that you want to. Like, it's a different level of satisfaction. It's not about the money per se. It's about what it unlocks for you to be able to do. It's just a resource. you have your own time. Sometimes you have your own energy, right? have, but, but money is just another currency exchange that, that we use.
00:58:53 - Chona Sweet (3)
So it's not, but anyway, not the end of, you know, it's, it's, Yeah, it's not my, I want that so I can buy or do something that I want. make the travel and make money, think that's like the best thing I have.
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, my work is portable.
00:59:14 - Chona Sweet (3)
I can take it anywhere that I want to.
00:59:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think about money for me and like energy. I don't, I don't want a lot of things that other people do, but beauty is important to me. scenery is important to me, experiences are important to me and they energize me. And with that energy, it increases my creativity, but also I take that energy back to my people. So, you know, being poor is not compatible with serving people the way that I want to serve them because I want to be thinking low level thoughts instead of high level thoughts. You know, there's a lot to take into account anyway, but so every day. Just tell me something that you're really proud of and that that and just celebrate the wins. You can tell me the things that you're frustrating. with you but we have to end it on this is what I did good or learned this is how I grew this is like some kind of something like that every day because it will just help keep things in perspective I need you to and I will write this out map time five new patient charts and five follow-up charts yeah every day just using dragon and getting a practice at it and just kind of seeing and observing do you feel like it's getting better just kind of just kind of watching the process and seeing what you can do and that's a start like that's a lot to do for this week and then the ideal week like what does the ideal week look like now and then a year from now knowing that it's going to change knowing that we're never going to have that picture exactly but that we have the greatest chance of creating something that you're really happy with by being intense. Intentional in terms of how you create it Yeah Thank you You're welcome. Do you have any questions or anything? No, I um, I just yeah I I need to that's a very you know like actionable I said like I need to tie myself Yeah, and don't don't stress and obsess but you do wanna always push yourself like you committed to giving your best and I'll so I'll tell you one last thing real quick before we go and this is kind of my own Tool that I use and I call it an energy sandwich So if I have to do things I don't like Anything I don't like drains my energy and it makes me in a bad mood. don't like doing there's a lot of things to do But so the first thing I will do is I'll start that activity before I start that activity I'll do something that I like um It could just be snuggling with the dog. It could be talking to somebody I like. could be I had a good lunch. It could be a nap. It could be all kinds of different things. It could be good music. It could be sunshine breaks. I like to go outside and just let the sun absorb into my skin. I get the energy from it. It feels good. And then the other thing is afterwards I plan something that will boost my energy as well. doesn't have to be long. Sometimes it's just putting on headphones and listening to something that without fail I cannot be still. It makes me dance. It makes me just feel good. So I use music really strongly like that especially if I don't have a lot of time. And the other thing is if I do something that's super stressful then I need to go do a physical activity because the tension is in my muscles. So like a little walk that might be when I go to the gym depending on how much time I have. I might do some housework. Sometimes I will just pace back and forth. but it still gets all the energy out. So just kind of noticing how your activities are impacting your energy and trying to sandwich good things in between bad things, even if it's just for five minutes here and there so that you're not staying in negative energy for any excess of amount of time. Okay, I know I've talked your air off already.

Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll keep following up with you then. And everybody go, have a good day and talk to you next week.
01:06:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, bye-bye. Bye.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, wait, wait. What?
01:06:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I sent the turn, the new turn down reasons to you and Patsy and then she never responded because she left him returning leave. He left. just put those in place.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Danny.

I cannot tell you how many times I am just picking up my phone to text you and then you log it.
00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's like the internet stop working. I'm like, I'm disconnect the Wi-Fi and now I'm getting bombarded with like, hacks and I think I'm show you what going to show you.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was behind the camera, so I can't show you this, but I'm going to show you what I did and got home at midnight last night after having done. Hold on, cuz it was crazy, damn, where'd go, here, this, you have an iPhone so I can just send a bunch, use bunch of grandma's, well not everybody was a grandma, one was not a grandma, but I am. And now I have two grandchildren, let's see, this one and this. also that so that you can see we climbed a mountain yesterday at a top of a rock and there was legit rock climbing with no equipment and some of it was pure vertical and the only way I got up there was wedging myself between rocks and arm strength because I was too short to get the foot holds and hand holds that on that rock that mountain yes it was three and a half miles there and back and we watched the sunset on top of the mountain and we could see two volcano mountains from where we were that were a hundred miles away on one side and one hundred miles away on another side and then we climbed down in the dark with headlamp so I was in trumpet AF last night mmm that was a wild that was fun it was cool how to share Uh, hey, how did you talk to Lisa at all?
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I sort of did, but not really. No, she's like in Jackson Hole or something. So she kept dropping out. So she was like driving through Nevada or something to Wyoming. We're not what the hell she's doing. So I just gave up.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much of that and that is just dead zone.
00:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so she was like, I lose you right here, losing him. I was like, and then it was like, no, here. No, no, no, wait, no. And then it actually got cut off and I was like, no worries. Oh, I don't know when she's coming back. think my mom told me, but I'm scared of me.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, um, so where's my notes, notes, she. So let's start with basis. How's that going since last week?
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
with Frank yesterday and they kind of they be I'm a second visa or I'm a second visa and Eric like who all met exactly the second.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:03:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All of them. Okay.
00:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're all but Norio.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah.
00:03:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. they were they were just trying to like like the like imagine Frank is like the blocks expert, right? So he's unlike the cutting edge of all that, right? And WordPress will like change the name of something and Frank adopts it immediately. He's like, oh, it's called this now. So like some of the some of the names we're using are not what they are now. So when he hears, but the word still is around.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just has a new meaning.
00:03:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what we call a pattern, for instance, this is true, but let's say it is, what we call a pattern is now called a layout, and a pattern is now something else. So they got together and they said, hey, we think there's some confusion around, like we need to make sure we're on the same page about what these things mean, or make sure that we're all using this to correct terms, right, because we think that we say this, and it turns out they were right. So it was like, okay, so they got the same page about that. And then they brought him up to speed on some of the other stuff that he was confused about, like, hey, why are you using a cloud? Why do you want to use a cloud library for this? how are you doing this? Eric's like, I think we got it, like, we definitely got it now. he's like, I think he was impressed even more. was like, oh, okay, got it. So then they said, for now, like, ranks, sort of like coming at it from a long term approach, like, Hey, you know, when you have a hundred clients, you're gonna want to be have this. And he focuses sort of in there. And they're like, we appreciate that. But we want to, we need to be working on the short term rather than the long term.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we work on the short term.
00:05:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And for us, the short term is being able to do XYZ, whatever. he's like, got it. Okay, yeah, it's like, it's not that we don't want to do what you're talking about. It's like, we don't need that now, we need that then. But let's do the now, now and then then. And then Eric today was like, he was like, Hey, I just want to let you know, like, if it would be possible to keep him around for like once a month calls, like once we get this stuff out of the way is like to keep him around as an advisor for some sort, he's like, I think that would be super beneficial. I said, sure.
00:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thinking about having. Yeah, more long term anyway.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, okay, no, because I don't, I wouldn't assume that that was possible. So he never mentioned anything about like a monthly engagement or anything like that. All that he has said to me was, Hey, maybe maybe when we're done with this, you could help me sell my stuff. Or do you know how to do that? I'm how to do this. Maybe there's mean we can work either like that. And funnily enough, Eric was today, before I said this, Eric, Eric was like, man, if Frank used our stuff, he'd sell so much more of his course or whatever.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like his check out and all his stuff is terrible.
00:06:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the code is good, right? So it's like, he's like, he's good at code, like really good. So that's the threat. So now they were like, this is what we want, we want to be able to do. These are the things, the problems that we have, let's resolve these problems. ones. So an example would be when we import a cloud template, make sure that it adopts all the styles, being able to set the global styles so that when you add a block or a gravity form or whatever, it adopts all of those. So that's what they're working on. And then showed him why it might not be the best solution for some of the that he's talking about, or we can do it like this. And he was like, oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense too. So yeah.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, the goal is still to get wolf or done by October, okay. And the G4, the journey, how are we doing?
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there's something wrong with one of our plugins. have to, I set up a test yesterday because I implemented our lead tracking on CMA. I'm for sure getting leads from ads and what I'm seeing, those events are not firing in, oh, you know what it is, the GTM container. I have to go to the container. It's not finally the container.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I just figured it out. What is CMA?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The certified management accounting exam.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we launched that site, whatever, like a year ago. It's. been steadily getting sales. So then I purposely tried to get leads. I'm getting like two or three leads a day right now. But they are not going up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. But I think I just can't a step. Do you know?
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you cannot, Dan. You cannot skip a step.
00:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I followed the swap that I created. I would have realized I'd skip a step and I'd just get it on the fly. Did you follow the process? I did not. No wonder I didn't work.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did So what else in that journey, what else did you want? I don't know what else did you do related to G4.
00:10:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Melissa is that she'll have all the stuff reviewed by the end of the day today. then she wanted to meet tomorrow. I'm not sure I can because I didn't think this stuff was tracking. But now I do think that stuff is tracking. So I need to go also saw something else weird yesterday that to go look at. Like there was an event firing in CMA that technically shouldn't be unless the way I defined it was URL based. And I said something like, hey, anytime a URL has SP in it, which would be a sales page, then do this. And if that's the case, then it would be correct. That is not the case that it's incorrect. And if that is the case, then I should have seen two other events and I didn't. So either the one event has messed up something's wrong, I think. So I have go look at that because the stuff that she's going to build is based off these three events firing on the sales page. But it would be that only a ninja because they just got a custom set up. It could and should be that they do fire on all sales pages across domains because they're not in any way product specific or page specific other than sales page is like this.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The should only throw in a sales page.
00:11:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm going to go make sure that a they're actually all firing correctly on ninja CPA. And if they're not, then I can't be with her because they're needed to build the report. If they are, then I can be like, okay, yeah, let's jump on a call and do at least one. Let's just do that one. Just broken the fix.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still going to like the custom JavaScript version of his thing, which is custom JavaScript, which I do not do, but I'm going to learn how.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. What does that allow you to do?
00:12:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's going to allow me to fire custom events based on custom documents, right? So the JavaScript says sort of like an if this, then that. If this happens, then fire writes out an example would be using that to fire my new customer event. So I'd say hey, if this is a new customer, then fire a new customer event. There's nothing built into GAPore or the GTN plugin or Woo that's made for that. So it's going to allow me to do this custom JavaScript.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see what those events are and so if you can't do it in GA4 or custom JavaScript, can you give me an example of the event?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I think of that and think you can do it with custom JavaScript. It's not going to be a default event, so a default event in GA4 would be a form submit, they have a built-in event that I see firing that I didn't set up, so a custom event would be not default, it's not built-in at all, and then it's also you're defining it, right?
00:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, like for example, was it be scrolling to a certain page?
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it add the card? Is it add the card?
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, yeah, all those are all those are built in.
00:14:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's fine. Yeah. So it's outside of those and then it can be completely custom, like new customer. No one is going to be, I mean, I'm not going to say no one, but probably very few people have ever set up a new customer event. So that's going to be me waiting for the order transaction result page to hit. And then I'm going to do a look up in the blue. I'm going to say, is this a new customer or not? If yes, then fire this custom JavaScript and call it new customer. Like event is new underscore customer.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, what purpose like just to know that this transaction was from somebody that you've never had before or like to what end is what I'm getting at.
00:14:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so then. in GA4 I can say, show me new customer sources. I say, your new customers come from Google organic.
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got you. Got you got you. Also, like, you know, then it would be like, you got this many new customers along the stuff that we already know, but it would be in that place too. And then, if I can do that look up and fire it into GA4, then I could also say, and go apply this tag in the infusion talk.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We used to work around with that with Infusionsoft and onto port with what we call the sandwich page. That was sandwiched between checkout and the thank you page, the landing page that the customer got to once they purchased. in the checkout page settings, you can always say, okay, where do they go after completion of checkout? so it would go to a sandwich page and all that was on there. was a pixel, a tracking pixel, and a redirect, a meta redirect, so that it happened, you know, within seconds. And so the customer never saw it because it's a blank white page, and it just looked like a page was loading. But that fired the pixel, and then it would go to their landing page, and it happened so quick that, you know, nobody was upset or bothered by it, but then it allowed us to get a fire, a pixel fired that wasn't built into any of the systems.
00:16:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, similar principle, except just JavaScript faster. Yeah, well, and you can do more, right, so I can like delay, I could send the event in the data layer after the fact, I can send it with everything else.
00:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that appending data is amazing. And I only seen that though, what JavaScript and jQuery.
00:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, same principle.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.
00:18:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's thing is like you can't, you can't measure what you don't know, right? It's like, I'm figuring out like, oh, yeah, want to measure. And then his custom JavaScript, so mine's like even more custom. And I can't, there's this, there's this idea that you can, you can take something like that and you can put it in as something else I can't remember the name of. But he's like, it's very rare that people use this, and I'm like, I have a feeling that's exactly what I'm going to need. And then his custom JavaScript is to do other things, like maybe you're combining events or you're defining your own where they scroll and stop plus 40 seconds. Like, I think you have to create a timer which JavaScript it does the 40 seconds. And they're like, okay, now fire it. So I'm getting into his stuff. But I think there's, and then I think once I go through his stuff, then, of course, that's going to make me go, Oh, I could do this, this and this too. Yeah, Lucy's, Lucy's working on the Lucy set up the creator user on form. It's working. We're making sure that doesn't break anything. He said, doesn't break anything. been live for like two days. Nothing's broken, but I know I haven't seen anything bad. And now I have to take the next step there is for me to get him to to insert custom meta on like I got to define the meta and then send it to them and say okay great create this meta so when they submit the form and you create the user also attach this meta magnet notes source whatever the source is in PGT I just have to look for and see like it'll probably like source not medium maybe campaign or keyword probably keyword oh and then Norio's gonna have to like I didn't know this but they've added utms so there's some new utms and then there's these new utms that have been added and then there's these other utms that are usable but not officially added that you know just allow you to and more data so Norio would have to like expand our plugin to include those, but we don't need them right now.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, one tab, there we go. yeah, so how's Noriel's stuff with high level and fan flow going?
00:21:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so he and I went around and around and there was some, so he has to sort of learn it, right, and then, but he gets to learn it, Ruby going, oh no, no, no. Go here, look at this, it does this, so he sort of gets short cut, only thing is to wait. Well, he doesn't really have to wait, right? By the time his email hits me his day is over and then when he wakes up the next day, he's got his answer provided I responded, and then lately he's been staying, he's screwed up later in the day, he was emailing me yesterday or he's working later because he was emailing me like definitely after her day was over but I think I got um everything he needs to get his first app working and then the the mod side or whatever the JD photos was named in their company the JD photos guy we we hooked up with them because they had the custom value updater that's how I found them so I paid 250 bucks to get access to their it's like lifetime access to their custom value updater but we keep running into it not working like intermittently and we don't really know it didn't work until somebody notices something's wrong kind of thing or something breaks essentially and then we'll trace it back and be like oh the values didn't get updated so those guys don't know when it breaks clearly we don't I don't know when it breaks, and then we hit them up and say, hey, this isn't working. So on the call of Monday, I'm like, man, this, when I was already thinking this, this doesn't work long-term. Long-term we need our own custom value updater, and we need one that would check, did the update occur? No, then run it again, or did the update, and if you can't, then it would send a message and say, custom values did not update something, something that would let someone know it's wrong. Ultimately, it would just not, it would just work or self-correct. So I hit up Norion, I was like, hey, I'm going to see if these guys will sell me their code. What do you need? And he's like, oh, you know, I need a walk-through or docs, and just that explains how it works, and he has seen some, he's seen the code that they write, and he's like, dude, their code's terrible. It's like it works, but it's not good. I'm like, not our concern at the moment, Norion. focus on the first part.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he like used some of their code to write his app. And so he's like, yeah, we can we can do that. I hit up those guys and told I explained to him, hey, look, listen, breaks. We don't know when it breaks. Ultimately, we need to own our own version, and I buy a copy of your code. And then we'll move it to our server and, you know, do that. Like, I was like, let me ask the developers. And then he came back, he's like, yeah, sure, we can sell a few 700 bucks.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Done. What?
00:24:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Stacy literally just sent them 700 bucks. And, uh, Nario just, I told Nario needs a loom. And, and then he's already worked with them to move code around. So they'll get it sent up on the server. And then Nario will tell me, I'll tell him what's wrong with it after the fact. We don't know when it doesn't work. So I'm sure he'll be like, that's easy.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, typical, or real fashion. Um, okay. Hold on a second. Seriously, click over there. So like, what is the, I have to go back and look at my notes from last week. Hold on a second. Was all this week? No. Yeah. I don't have like, what are the targets for what Noreo is doing?
00:25:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Meaning.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what do you, he's working on building fan flowy, right?
00:25:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's finishing the wedding, the, the wedding time. Yeah, but that's still, that's Abishik keeps finding like bugs and whatever. So there's, it's like true bugs and Noreo's fixing those and then there's nice to house or what if it. And the what if it did nice to haves are being Saved but not worked on so nor is just fixing the bugs and He got another round of those literally on Monday right right up to the meeting So he's like I'm not sure what I'm gonna be done. It's weeks, but he's like provide it He's like I thought Abhishek was done, but I literally just got an email with like five more So but he had talked to Abhishek about hey just yes, I want to hear it all and separate them like this And so they're doing that He's like man. He is good at finding this stuff and he really is So that will probably be done I would say by the end of September and Then Eric is talking to Norio about What to confirm is what we tell you about the summer day So we have the free wedding seating planner for epitome and then I bought the way of that So that's basically just a lead gen site and it's fill out this form and get access to our free win and seeding planner The idea being we generate leads they tell us engage pop up by Budget all the good stuff and then we give them access we limited access to Perfect wedding timeline just the seeding planner portion So Eric's needs to talk to Noria about okay, how do we do how are we doing that? It's gonna be a gravity form to what a webhook an API What and then once that function is worked out Greg's already done the design and then we'll just do like a super simple I mean problem. I mean I say a one-page site might legitimately mean it like there might be some Content pages that we do in the background that are for SEO, but like they're not in the nav Right, there's there's nothing for sale on that site It's just straight up you want to pre-winning seating planner popped in.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I like that. And what is, do you have like a target date for that?
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we can't use it until the software is done. So we're going to try to, once we know the connection, then, I mean, I might look at like, it's like, what is a good, I'm sure there's one, I'm sure there's one from back in the day, where it's like just a pure lead gen site. Like to me, it's just like, that you're free-winning, like, and every email. And then of course, it'll just expose the other fields. So I might just look for like, what's the best opt-in site ever? Great, someone had like a free SDO analyzer, like back in the day, like crushed.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things just didn't.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be something like that. I'm going to go find something like them and just do that. Fine. I mean, that will take Craig. 20 minutes, and it'll take like, and I'm still at the thing where I'm like, I don't want to build sites until this stupid thing is done. So there's also that. I'm interested to see like how far they get. I think they meet with Frank every, I think it's every week.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now they just back on top of vacation.
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Oh, I have the notes about high level is raising third party integrations, but I just kind of left that hanging and I don't know. remember talking about it, but I don't remember.
00:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
scenario to review but it's not like unlocked yet you can't even what they do is they they release stuff in the lab so it's going to be in the lab I want to say like yeah I want to say it's like three weeks but there was some doc there was some documentation on it when I sent you to Norio okay and on Monday he's like all review it and like you know like sort of was like this is what I'm thinking like that it's going to be like another level of being able to integrate with it and I mean that's exactly what it sounded like so it's like beyond APIs I'm like I don't know what that really means that'd be interesting yeah I think it's that you can get access to like user ID and stuff that you can't get access to be just the API so we'll see um let's hold on a second
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, so the conversation about basically having the kind of menu items and what the team can provide when people request custom work or, you know, like what's the scope of support basically for basis customers, Bobbi was getting back at that and making sure that everybody's on the same page with that.
00:31:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where is that at right now? I don't know. Did I not go to meeting on Monday? I missed it.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, it had to be over within nine minutes because I went there. was like, holy crap, I snoozed the alarm one too many times because I was making lunch. I was like, oh, it's like night after. And then I dial in and there's nothing.
00:31:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We definitely didn't talk about it.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Need to talk about it?
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't talk about it. mean, I know he was working on, but I don't know. don't know that I'll see if it should be a task somewhere. I don't ever go into work.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to knows of. If she doesn't know of it, then it's probably not passed out, but we'll see. Just to make sure that it's getting traction. Oh, Brunchy, no more issues, only reset you with the last thing.
00:33:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we figured out the fact that if user logged in and creates an API, it's only visible to that user. It's not visible to anybody that has admin access to the account. So Heather had logged in and created an API key at one point. Ross had logged into their account, Ross had landed, logged in and created an API key at one point. I wish I could be J had logged into range. And then they were something, whatever, one of the sites and they'd created an API key. So then when Eric or whoever was going in and changing the API key and I'm replacing it on the site, there was always another API key that that person couldn't see. One way or the other. So there was Eric, he didn't see Abishik. He didn't see Abishik, he didn't see Eric, so it was Heather. She didn't see Eric, so there was Eric, he didn't see Heathers. So in essence, it was always an API key available. So when the one, you know, Heather and Ross and those guys, they're not working on the site. So what was happening was Eric would change the API key and whooper and it would still happen. We're like, how is this happening? We never understood how it was happening. It was because there was an exposed API, there was a compromised API key that was there that nobody essentially knew about. So now they've all been deleted. And then Only we are creating API keys and those like do not create API key and it's definitely quelled it almost completely but Wolfers We're trying to get them moved over to stripe and then brain tree still giving us a bunch of Like we're like we're not even using you guys anymore and they won't the account Because they're like your account is still at risk. We're not using it So it's not at risk and they're like you need to put capture on your checkout will unlock the account That was this morning like oh my god really So soon as that one gets out of risk they'll unlock the account and then proceed with the migration step but they have not done that yet and I think with Think with Reset you there were so few that they just manually migrated them or they're going into, but in the brain news off. So the other two are underway. They will hopefully be off within a week or less. And then we're done with brain tree.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was the most outcome. how is another 71 doing just any updates since last week?
00:36:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually the week part is the same at the weird part is. It's the same average of last year where last year we thought we're going to increase sales because they're changing the exam, right? Which now seems like maybe wasn't totally true. Maybe it was just, I mean, again, we don't have enough data, right? Because if you go back three years, you're in this COVID world. So we're like point, like point one off. So like, let's say last year we were averaging 30, 33 point or 34 sales a day or something. Right now, we're like 33.9, oh my God, so it's like nearly identical. And then that persisted through, well, that went well into December with this gigantic spike right before the exam was removed. So we don't know. We don't know what's gonna happen. We're just keeping on, keeping on. It's still just going to come down to where the new customers come from, especially where the new customers come from in 2025, or at least from May of this year forward where things sort of return to normal, but then more so in like, okay, this is normal. We're in a normal year. Where do these people come from? It's still going to come down to that. Even if we're just back on track or back, we're at this pace of like the best pace ever. I think we're up to like almost 4300 subscribers. It's still going to be like in order to grow this.
00:38:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to know where your customers come from. Right.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's... We bought CMA exams.com, like a week, a week ago, two weeks ago. So I just was texting Bobby about that, so we're building that site. So now we'll have CPA exam.com, CMA exam.com, there isn't an equivalent for CPE, but we started getting some CPE sales, our renads for those, we started getting sales, but I'm not sure they're coming from there yet, but that'll be the thing, it's like, okay, once I can get all this tracking lined up and locked in, then we're gonna know. Oh, and the other, and then we figured out, I never thought about this before, so we started ranking for ethics exam, so the ethics exam is this exam that they have to take after they've passed all four sections, so it's like literally your final step before you get licensed, so we had ethics exam pages on CPA exam.com and then I noticed, I think it's like an off-sh of the other SEO that maybe those started ranking better, and then we've gotten an uptick in leads there, and then I was like, wait a minute, we could rank for all 50 states for those, and essentially you're gonna get a bunch of people that pass the exam with who knows who, I don't care. I don't care what you bought at this point, but I do know that you're gonna need CPE in the near future once you get your license, so that we have an ethics exam guide for all the states. So like, if we start SEOing that, then start pitching those people into CPE, that could probably work out. So Gert and those guys, we gave them, we bought like 25 SEO pages of them. We're like, hey, can we take four of those and do these four ethics exam pages, we just picked the top. Like, I know, I think we've picked Delaware for some reason. Oh, because it was the most representative what the content should look like. So we actually took one page, sent it to them. They're going to optimize that one. And then we're going to say, great, not going to these four based on the template you just came up with. So then they'll do California, Florida, Texas, New York.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, that just seems kind of like this similar type of stuff that we've been doing with Mark, which is leveraging more, don't know, sources, not necessary sources, but entry points. Yep, it is too. Yeah, the market increase and that those analytics like that systematic, detailed, accurate level, analytic stuff that you're working on and building is who else is doing that? else is doing that. Like I feel like you're going to exceed your goals quickly. I don't know what quickly is. can't quantify that, but I think that the pace will be like when you get there be like, damn, I don't like, look what happened.
00:42:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's all like, you know, whether you sell it or not, you, you know, just make more money.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were talking about getting back to your breathing stuff.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did something else, but I did it on Mondays. What'd you do? Yeah. got it. It was this other sort of guided thing because I was at home. So I like, I can't really. was at home and I had the dogs when I can't really check out for an hour. So I was like, I could probably check out here in the hammock for 20 minutes. Mm-hmm, and it worked whatever was I forgot about it was one I'd never done But I was like, oh it was it was one that was like It's like a meditation to get in touch with your spiritual guide. I was like, I'll try that I found an audible weirdly enough Interesting I want to my thought about me either I've got like a gazillion audible credits lined up.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I proceeded to buy like five books Okay Snaps, Snaps I I'm scrolling back to obvious eight and it says that your peak in the past was 4,000 60 active subscribers and did you just tell me today?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at your 4300? Oh, no, the 4,060 is the proverbial glass ceiling.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that year passed?
00:44:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, but I realized you can pass it, right, during your peak season. So my guess is, let's say, so yeah, we're passing. So let's say we, I think we hit that early July mid mid-July. I think we hit a mid-July. So from that day forward, my guess is if I take that number and the number on January 1st, the average will be 4060. It can't really be more than that because the math dictates. But can you exceed it right now? but then I also know in December, we will get three or four hundred cancellations. So let's say we get up to 44. for 100, which we may or may not, but whatever it is, we know there's going to be a mass exodus in December. And then if you were to average it out, your average is probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060. And Bobbi's like, we're past it. And I was like, yeah, that's true. But there's some missing something. And then I thought, oh, wait, yeah, of course you can exceed it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But averages are basically not that. Well, that's going to be fun to see and interesting. It'll be funny, even if it's true, because the numbers, well, yeah.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the only thing that will change it is if the 33 remain, right? That's based on it being 31 average as well, right? So if the average is stays at 33, which we won't know until November, then you can exceed the 4060. Then it would be whatever I'd have to rerun the math and be like, okay, now it's 40 109 or whatever that
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is 33 being new, um, customers, right a day, uh, subscriptions, new subscription, not new customers, customer, the customers is a 21 or whatever we've always been using 21 and 31.
00:46:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Those, those are the ones that got us.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. met Melody was getting some pushback from Melody and she wanted to build it a certain way. I'm like, no, no, no. And then she's like, we need to talk about this. I attended the call and she explained it. And then when she was done talking, she was all like, this is it. I just said, wrong. It's like, that's to be rude. Wrong. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we don't like this. And then I explained it to her and her and the other guy were like, yeah, we could do it that way. And then we all get what we want. Your way, I lose a lot. You gain a lot. And I lose a lot. This way we both don't lose. You gain what you want to gain. I gain what I want to gain. And it's all better off. So then they're like, then now they're going about building that, which is essentially it involved like re-architecting the tags. It's like a slight re-architecture. But but because it's across like six products and yadda yadda. and we had to remove a bunch of tags, they're like, all right, we're gonna go build it out and then, I'm right, I mean, I know I'm right, because I thought about it, I'm like, I'm right, this will work, and it will resolve a bunch of issues, so they're in the process of doing that re-architecture and creating the missing tags, and then writing down, okay, we're gonna get rid of these tags, and this is how we're gonna get rid of them, and then they hooked up, they hooked up a plugin yesterday that helps them, they're very concerned about like, people losing access when they have two subscriptions, which really isn't that big a deal, but even that will be resolved, and then part of the plan would also be to eliminate the infused Woo plugin, which their convinced is somehow causing some of these issues, which may or may not be true, and I was Like, that's fine, because I took portions of that away from that. I took portions of the functionality away and put it in Zapier, and it's worked fine, but we could use make, like, either or, um, so the plan is for them to get it all mapped out, built, essentially, and then, then we're going to figure out when we can launch it. And we're basically at, like, the price is going to be, like, 77 and 87, think. Jeff didn't want to do the 77. I'm like, we have to, because if nothing happens, we've done this for nothing.
00:52:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remind me with the 77 and 87 are.
00:52:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do have that, but I didn't do it good that 77 a supplement 87 is full course, right? Okay. And we just had someone, this was online. like last week someone went on a Reddit and they started this thread and it was like do not buy me just cpa review it to rip off and it the guy was complaining that he was complaining about he was complaining that that didn't refund them or something it was like super super ready and then like a mild pile on started with this other guy that came in and then all these other people started commenting and it was just it's just so sad that it's so clear they think it's a supplement they think it's a supplement and then they also questioned the sixty seven dollars i'm like oh my god and then our people showed up the ninjas showed up and they're like what are you talking about like do the math If you buy a Becker for 3,000 if you buy a ninja and you take each second up to the three months at a time time 67 you're only spent you're spending less than a thousand dollars, and then they're like just the best I've never had a problem with him. He's the only person he's been in this industry forever He's the only person that comes right just the deluge of defenders and then I guess the mods came in They weren't around and they're like yeah, we're deleting this whole thing This is this person just joined reddit and their first thing is to to track and slag on one of the best cpa review courses There is delete they deleted the whole thing.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get the screens?
00:54:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's first no like I Was like it I was like on my phone To get well we have tons of those there's tons of those on on reddit So I do want to start using them on the new sales page because I think they're more powerful than yes You know testimonial block We have great ones. We have whole threads that just wave about us.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you for sure should be using them in your marketing.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. We have one that's literally called is Ninjacy. And this is like someone asking a question for real. Is Ninjacy Pay Review a scam? Like I couldn't have paid to have someone do that. We use it in our emails. In case you're wondering if Ninjacy Pay reviews a scam, go here. And it's all these people raving about it. We have this one dude on Reddit that's like are one of our biggest defenders. He's like, I passed all four sections using Ninja whenever, but his screen name is Nutella Nick. Oh, I know. I'm like, oh, buddy, it's hard to recognize you in marketing. Only because it's a trademark term, not no other reason.
00:55:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. But he showed up. He showed up and like went off like, this is .
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but couldn't you use it and then just like black out parts of the username like and you.
00:56:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, we don't even need to use this. No, there's tons of them. But I want to use those instead of the, I mean, we created these testimonial blocks. But I'm like, and we have like the Reddit logo. I'm man, we should be using just straight screen caps of those. And then, and then them in those locations, rather than us cutting pasting the actual thing and linking to it. Like we'll cut and paste and then link to the actual thing. But no one's probably clicking through. mean, that's something I can look at. But I doubt people are clicking through. Whereas they, if they see it's from Reddit, just from the, like literally like a better and then videos. It's like, okay, those are probably your two. best but i can split test this video testimonials yeah we use those those totally work i was just about to ask you about them because i think that like we have tons do you have a social media account or you just share that stuff regularly uh we i run them as ads on facebook this one this girl made is so good oh like oh my god you couldn't it's like it's like she made it on purpose but he didn't right and she sent it to us and we turned into an ad where do you stockpile your testimonials the video ones are in this service called boast and then the text ones we don't even gather anymore we just have so many it's ridiculous yeah but you should keep them current uh i mean they're not I don't think the date. I don't think we put dates on the testimonials. Um, any of them, really.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I don't even think we gather.
00:58:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, we gather them on the cancel. So they do, they do updates. I just haven't used a new one recently. Sometimes I'll you, I'll check out the video ones and maybe I'll swap in the video one here and there. Uh, but I try to let, you know, I'm trying to get someone that's like, they use Becker. They, they're a ninja only, right? I can only use like so many. Like I was with Becker and then this, right? So it's like, okay. and then I ran some of his ads and like you see which ones did good as ads, then I put them on the landing page and then I ran a test on the landing page at which one do people watch the most and I made that one first. Did you like that?
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish that we got to do another 71 completely separately because I I would so love to drive growth there, that would pay, would love to drop growth there too, hopefully I'll be able to do that as soon as the stupid tracking is worked out because I don't know how to drive growth there. I have so many ideas and there's stuff that you touch but not systematically. But once you get that set up, we'd be able to track everything. But it needs to be set up because I literally just been throwing stuff at the wall for years.
00:59:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still convinced I could turn off all the ads and nothing would happen. Or it would happen but it would take six months. I'm like, I don't want to find out that way.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Gosh, it's crazy just thinking about, first of all, it was seven years ago, and then you're like, I don't do email. I'm like, it doesn't work. I know, I know, look at that. And then maybe you might still be right. But regardless, the thing is, we've watched, we've learned it together with Mark is that there is a, you know, having multiple, so for him, it's vendors. For you, I think it would be channels, ad channels. Oh, yeah, like a formal approach and multiple tactics to what you're applying on those channels that don't in and of themselves make huge differences. But the compounding effect are like, first of all, anytime things dip, you don't really dip, you don't even feel it because everything else just kind of buoyed it up. But yeah, but the analytics portion of it is to be able to have very clear, reliable data is huge. And just
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
all the things that you've learned over the years anyway adding adding into that anyway that's awesome holy crap how's it 105 i could just whatever toy flies okay wait so meditations we're good you're taking care of you sound good found the good you've only just got her moving date so we gotta go visit the campus and then she moves in on his two day 2021 20 is a Friday i'm like probably moving in on the 21st that's a temper yeah she got her dorm assignment she's gonna have two roommates and a expert large triple and everything i mean it's the oh she told me the name of the building it's like an author's last name no i think it's a hog So I think can tag another, I don't think that is another, so the HAG haul, I guess, and I don't know what the hell is up with college right now, but you want to talk about a light schedule. I was like, you're kidding. That's it.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like four classes, period. What? That's it. That's it. And they're on the quarter system. So it's 10 weeks. And we have four classes, 10 weeks, and then 10 weeks. I don't know if some of them carry over, they're two quarter classes or whatever, but she's like maxed out on credits, which is like, I literally can't take anymore. She's like one credit guy, I'm like the total max, and that's four classes or something. And then her earliest classes at eight and her latest classes at eight p.m.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But also also.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a wide.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
breath yeah so what's she taking on that like what's her major bio no biology microbiology okay how far away is she doing the school yeah it's eight hours drive uh it's an hour of life hour now how is Denise doing i'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking able and leaving really yes yeah you don't need the care i'm like for though i just look at it as part of life i mean it's what happens unfortunately things move forward where we march on it's going to be interesting how mario handles not having a sister around even if they don't get along you what she's already acting weird yeah it's it's hard i don't know if it's related, but it's like, I think it might be.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're they're talking, they've been talking more than ever the last like two months.
01:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like amongst themselves or whatever. And she's definitely over the I hate Evelyn face. I wasn't that long, but it would be had for a while. Yeah. then, yeah, so it'll be interesting see how her and Denise react.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you revolve car, you need the ocean, and you need to figure out how to keep those two happy, because this is going to be very hard for them.
01:04:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I, whereas I was like, you know, she apparently, so Jenny DeRoz went to the school to UC Santa Cruz. And I don't know what I said to her, but she's like, Oh, yeah, no, like, you're only guaranteed housing your first semester. And then the second semester, it's like hit or miss, or your first year, you have to live on campus for year, you can't have a car. And then your second year, you can apply to live on campus. But it like hit her mess. She's like, it's like, she said when she was gone, there was like a borderline crisis to get housing. And then everyone's like, no, it's still like that. Like everyone's saying like getting housing the second year. So then you have to get off campus. And Jenny's like, when we went to go off campus, she's like, I literally, you need a dossier on yourself to get the gut housing. And then we go apply for it. 50 people are applying. And then it's like hit her mess. And of course, my takeaway is like, oh, I should buy two bedroom condo and Santa Cruz, little mirroring.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that play.
01:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, that's the entrepreneurial take is property. Right. I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pay rent or, or boarding to the school, why wouldn't I just pay to myself? Right.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm paying it either way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. like, I should go to, so a two bedroom condo. 800 grand, so I'm like, hmm, let's see how this election pans. I got about a year. like, can hit the fan between it's gonna hit the fan soon. What? they just revive, you see that the labor, the jobs, number revision that they just did, they're like, oops, turns out we were over by 800,000. You're kidding. Really? So that, until that, so that was like two, three days ago, leading up to that, and still even yesterday, people were talking about, oh, bed's gonna lower the rates. Well, part of the way they do that is they're using employment or rather unemployment as like a leading indicator. So it's like, they're like, unemployment's good, so you can lower the rates, is sort of already. And it's like, hmm, but if that number It was run by 800,000. Isn't this other number wrong? Like, isn't this leading indicator fake balls incorrect? Well, it's like, yes, but if they so they lower the rates, I mean, it sort of where this if you I was someone would show these charts, like the parallel between what's happening right now and like the two right before the 2008 crash is like very similar. A lot of the indicators look the same. So it's like, why wouldn't it go that way? And then lowering the rate. People are like, you know, a lot of financial people are like, you can't lower these rates. Like, you can't do that. You could trigger a much worse outcome. Ron doesn't say the whole time. There's no way this ranks. She's like, there's no way. There's no way that they keep saying soft landing. She's like, I don't see it. I don't see how it's possible. You have to pull a rabbit out of a hat. She's like, I don't believe it. I don't believe this is real and I would come in due time, like it's either it's going to happen, and then that would be like this quarter, right? They do. They only meet once a quarter. That meeting's probably in the next couple weeks. So they're either going to do it or they're not. And then the markets will react based on that. And we'll see. And then God only knows what happens with this election.
01:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want this. I don't want either one of them. But here's the thing about Trump is like, we know who he represents him. He represents who he is, what he is. We know his pattern. We know his MO because he's a steady douchebag. But like what his strengths are, we have some definitely definite economical power, There's there's some good.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's disgusting.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's right. Kamala is a puppet. Like she we don't I don't even know who she represents. I don't know what she represents. Somebody's behind her, now no idea who it is. I don't know what their MO is. I don't know anything about that. so she is a wild card that puts us at huge risk. And we have no idea. But why I think she'll win, which I don't want, but why I think she'll win, is because I think she will bring out the female and black voters just because she's woman and black, and that between the two of them, that's a population that has been largely just like, if everybody, I don't really care. I think a lot of females that never voted well now. And same with black people. And I think, and especially looking at the stats right now, how amazing she's doing, which is, again, terrifying. She's stupid. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't stand for anything. And I don't know who's behind her. That's the most, yeah. So like in terms of like business and needing to create as much. Like I want to get to being able to rent my house out, buy another one, like have some property investments as soon as possible. There's no solid guaranteed investment, but the one thing about like in my church, we do food stores. I'm like, I'm gonna have property stores. If I meet family to live, you know, it can either make me money or it can house my people, but one way or the other, like that's where I want to start with it. Like yeah, kids. So okay, let me get back to your Denise Rowland for a second and the girls eight hours away, holy crap, you should buy the property. She is gonna hit the fan. I'm so glad that you're doing the work of the analytics right now because that foundation, like as she hits the fan, there are, and this is why I teach what I teach, it's fundamentals, right? There are certain types of things, clean, accurate data so that you Because a lot of people are going to be trying to guess and figure out what to do, and you're going to have the ability to know what to do, plus all the things that you've already built, the systems, the teams, the reputation, having had a very smart offer for a while now, especially with it being the subscription model that you already paid the price for, all the dip and finances. There's so many things that you've been doing, and we knew that the recession was coming. It took longer than most people, most of the analysts, most of the VCs thought it was going to take because they pumped money in, but we knew it was going to happen. And it gave you enough time to do such a good work, but I don't like, I mean, you might feel a dip, but it's not going to hurt you at all.
01:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Why don't you think that will be a dip because in 2008, I went and looked at this at one point. randomly because of David in 2008 when that uncertainty enters right it's not going to help it helps his business because people are like I need to get a new job right I need to they also retreat to education so they go my domain and yours so they retreat to education and there was like a we got a bump a noticeable bump back then and we didn't have our own product so it was like oh that's interesting and you could see I look up here I think I looked at search day I looked at a bunch of stuff I was like oh that's interesting plus we the if a pandemic didn't take us out pretty sure research is not like it was like they shut
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
down the entire business and it was like and we made it yeah that's it's crazy but it's awesome also if i can just get through whatever the it's just the having taken care of everybody so long getting myself so far in debt trying to do that when i get this going and all the data that i have with it like i don't worry about anything also because of the investing that i'll do but like there's so many there's so much volatility for so many people which is why i'm helping three other families but it's it's scary for other people and then i'm going to see so many people i care about just struggling because they're already struggling because things are so expensive but it's also amazing to me what being strategic and consistent can do for people yeah yeah anyway all right well good job I'm so glad you're doing the GA4 stuff. I cannot state that enough. It is so important.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, good job.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really make some good plans for Mario and Denise and Evelyn too, although she's probably going to be having fun, but then she's also going to get very homesick and that you're going to be in the middle of all of that. Good luck.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do think it's great. Here's the silver lining. If you time it rightly, that's a word.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It actually is a word. That's the right way. You can like a flight to San Jose is like 60 bucks. So I was looking at that in my company. That's what we doable. So you could go visit her at the drop of a hat and it's not going to, right? Like 45 minute drive. Easy peasy. Like you could do that in the day anytime. Anytime you wanted, um, which was not the case for my parents playing from Boston to DC there in the sixty nine dollars life Made major of airports. You could just show Denise all the things that are on the table because she still doesn't really get like what you're Doing this. Yeah, we're gonna go. We're gonna go visit now because now we can go visit I was hoping it would play out like this. I go. Okay, great. I can buy a flight for like next Wednesday We fly up in there in the morning running a car driving the campus ago. This is your dorm This is where your first class is.
01:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this.
01:15:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is that We're looking at like theirs target. Okay, great because we're gonna be here in two weeks doing this. Yeah, we're three weeks doing this again.
01:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, good. They're gonna do good, but keep using that brain of yours for Building your family because this transition period sucks. It's hard But it's better when you're when you when you do the planning and when you do all this stuff. they're just going to need you. That's all I'm telling you. They're going to need your even killed and an entrepreneur. We solve these things.
01:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that bothers you. Let's fix that. Goodness. No parking. We're at the office. He's like, something's here.
01:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You took her to the office.
01:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Someone was supposed to be here. I mean, Eric and Stacy, and then I was like, can't be at home. Someone else was supposed to come out of office, who I think just, if it's them, I'm going to be surprised that you knew it was somebody else. Because Eric and Stacy, walking around the whole time, you haven't made a sound. I guess this is the other person's here.
01:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have, Zinni or Bell? Bells. All right, so I will let you go figure out who that is and I will talk to you Monday.

That's weird, it's like grey, hi, hello, how are you, good and well, yeah, deep breath.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, today is, this is our, my work week, so it's every day, every day, lots of meetings for me today, but I just came from a saw, so I'm trying to wake back up because she put me out.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
awesome. Yes, my lady, she's a Russian and she's been taking care of me for years and I just go like, like, I get baby like little girl taking care of and I'm like, oh, it's the best so. And then I was like, Booty paid for this today. Hey, glad to, glad to accountability. I like felt bad about it for a minute. I'm like, well, you use the one that wants accountability and you needed this. So we just get you to do your stuff without punishment. Then I'll pay for my own. Just happily. And you will have learned the thing.
00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't feel bad at all. I didn't get it.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are you ready to work on this today?
00:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
looks like you are. Yeah, so this is from July. I'm like, you know, like we talked about two weeks ago, we hired the manager. been really good. I've been giving him, you know, little by little bit, giving him some of the tasks that I do, of which, you know, tracking the numbers is one of them. So we expanded this based on what we talked about, I think, two weeks ago. then last week we completed it. And so these are pretty much all of our data as far as we can go back and track. So we opened in April of 2023 and you can see we got 87 people that first month, we didn't really keep track of it then so we just started it the next month but essentially after that we started tracking how many new visits we completed and these are the follow-ups and you can kind of actually see that we were actually doing okay in some of the months like you know some of the ones last month we got 94 so this month we're we're act you know like we talked about we're actively trying to seek out second visits and third visits from from case managers. Awesome.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to process the data but also I have some immediate thoughts. A couple of things are number one I would like to put a formula after column B which is basically the current month divided by the previous month. or, you know, and going up and down so that we're looking at a percentage of change, increase or decrease month to month, just kind of eyeballing the fluctuation on a percentage level. The raw numbers are helpful, but just that other perspective just kind of helps take a look at things. And it also is a faster way of triggering an appropriate level of alarm or yay, you know, celebration when you see those percentages. So we can do that pretty easily. And then I know that we don't know what you get paid per visit. I know that that's a unique thing. But what I would like to do is, and we were starting to calculate just kind of average fee per visit. I know how not accurate that number is. I am aware of that. But it gives us something to look at that does have a real corollary value, you know, to kind of look at how things are going. So as long as we keep that in perspective and don't, you know, and I know you won't, but just, you know, I'm not going to go. That's a real number. That would be something that would be good for us to do as well. Sorry about that. Let's see. It's all of us. It's okay. we're tracking Washington, Arizona, Mexico, familiar state to me. I'm meeting with Jonah and Margaret too. this is, this is my sweet love, oogee day. Good people. I like good people. All of us is completed. I love that that number went up. up even though number of referrals went down. So, let's see, actually, never mind. Okay, so total NP is completed. That's what I actually want to look at. And how many of those were referrals? NPV. What does NPV stand for? It's the first one.
00:05:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's initial new patient visits.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a new patient visits. Okay. I was like, I know, think that that's initial, but I don't know of course. I think she massaged my brain just late. Okay, so that didn't go down that went up. That's awesome. That number had a couple of dips out of curiosity. Do you happen to have any idea what happened in November and December that your numbers went down? could you pinpoint that to anything? Or is that just? July is referrals and so this isn't like Q and me is the one that has a lot of you, right? Yeah, this is July. Okay. Um any idea what that dip was about?
00:06:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, this is actually up in so up in these first six months I did all the marketing myself, meaning I'm calling, you know, was calling case managers like Mark's team and I was just begging them to send me a client and in October I actually stopped and I I bought three different marketing companies. So I put each of them charged me $1500 a month to market for me and I I said, Hey, let's try it. So I I tried three different companies. Only one of them actually did anything and I cut the other two off. But that's what happened in October and November is I stopped doing it myself. And I think you could see like by January like the three marketing companies, they started getting a little traction help me out a little bit. But the first few months that I stopped doing anything on my own, this is what happened.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you still doing it?
00:07:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm just using one marketing company and yeah.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:07:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And again, like this, you know, this value for a number of referrals is where I always wanted to be was about 400 a month. I thought just 400 referrals a month was good. know, 400 total visits would also be about right. So, you know, if we can get this every month combined with this number of total visits. That's actually kind of where I want to sit.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's highlight those.
00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. But you know, the other thing that Mark was saying is that, you know, we're worried about the insurance is tracking me and trying to become too big. But I, you know, I hadn't really talked to Mark about what, hey, what if I go after just other states, right? know, and obviously they're tracking me in California, but what if I really try to. higher or do the marketing myself in Arizona and in Mexico, Washington, and really try to grow the volume there. But I haven't really explored that.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, can we make that a task? I didn't mean you make it a point of talking to him before we meet next week.
00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that'd be fun. Because it's really tough to end.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And the sooner we know, the better. I heard that you guys might be having the most epic 24 hours ever.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I just bought a car like I told you. And then last next week, we're buying a $4 million house. yeah, yeah, I will not be participating this year unless it becomes a little bit.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he had quoted like 50,000 a person.
00:08:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's like, I don't know about that one.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just had a brownie baby. And that's a little bit on the dangerous side. If I was us or I'd be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, But that's just probably way cooler than me.
00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, she's actually letting me go to my friends for you for a big, it's next month.
00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, it's different than like drifting, okay? And just like, oh, that's crazy. I saw that like my heart.
00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looked really cool to do.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Father updates on July front to help us meet this volume I actually brought on a fifth provider. It's a physician assistant network like all the four physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are working for me, all like they like working for me. So they're all like, hey, can my friend get a job with you? So I finally picked one that looked good. And so we brought her on. She's actually starting right now. She took a shift from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. So she's seeing patients like right as we speak, this is her first day. So yeah, excited to do that. It'll increase our nighttime. And she's going to help in the evenings. weekends, particularly.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that'll help our capacity at those times to accommodate this volume. And what do you pay for that?
00:10:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I pay $75 a visit, whether it's a new or whether it's a return. And I increase their salary or I increase their pay to $30 after like six weeks.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's still a good margin for you and let you increase capacity without burning out?
00:10:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, on average, we make about what 300 per visit blended between using returns, right? So I'm paying them $30 and then my staffing costs about probably about $30 on the back end for each visit, so.
00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so yeah, that's good. And they're per visit, not per hour.
00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah, totally per visit. I also pay them to if some patients want like a doctor's out to be excused off work. So I pee smell everything. charge, we charge for that. I charge for that to the lawyers. And then I subsequently pay them $12 if they write a work note for someone. And what do you charge for it? I charge $300 and I generally get paid about 50 on that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But $300 for the doctor's note?
00:11:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
For the doctor's.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. But you only get 50 out of it because of the way that, okay, got it, got it.
00:11:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, I've been about 25%. So yeah, so maybe 60.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So another formula that I want to have is the percentage of our PVs to NPVs. So that we're looking at.
00:11:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I feel like we, I was supposed to do this. Do you think you could find the notes from last week? I was just looking real quick. I think we actually talked about. doing these things I just never did them.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and I didn't send a follow-up to actually make it an official task, but we did for sure.
00:12:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I wasn't so familiar. So I'll work on those and get them done.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I mean, ultimately, and the faster we do this, the better your results are, right? And my goal is to make sure that you see the value in showing up and doing this work every week. This could be as possible because I want you to keep coming back. was like working with the same people. It's really nice for me. We do, we do. go. And the notes, that tasks.
00:12:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I wanted to show you this one. This is something that you had kind of brought up about how we can track our workers remotely. so I want to the metrics that the manager and I came up with, it was just we look at their call logs like literally how many patients did you call a day right because if we know how many new visits or how many new referrals we got you know so if we got 300 in August that means there should have been there's 20 working days or there's 22 working days so there should have been like what 10, 15 calls a day and so and then obviously if you don't get someone the first day we call them at the second day so like if you can't look at any two days generally about right like they're calling you know most work days they're calling about not so many they're calling 20, 30 people a day something like that now Ollie Ollie actually works part-time she only works four hours and Eric and Carolina were eight hours so it is actually kind of interesting like most of the times it's almost double but there's some days where you see like she does almost as many as my full-timers so it's something the manager and I are going to look at, and this is the blended average so far that we created here.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would do additionally is actually put in the hours just so you again, there's something that is really powerful, and this is why we use the visuals, and also why we do specific types of formula and put data in a particular kind of way. Because what we want to do is make our brains be able to rapid-fire, get to the most powerful conclusion. So if you were to do that, put hours for each one of them, and then create a formula that were average calls per hour. Okay, we did that. Yeah, so oh there it is. I'm just focused. have tons of I thought it was. and I thought it would be the other way around. Wait, okay. So, when you say Eric slash Carol, how do I say that?
00:15:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, he has wife split a full shift. So he does the morning and she knows you does four hours in the afternoon.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that column H hours or calls?
00:15:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is this column is how many total on average they did for day.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so where are you getting the formula for calls for hours? where are you getting hours in your formula?
00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Or did you just plug it in? Oh, we first we looked at just the total number of months or total number of calls they made in a month right here. And then we divided it by how many hours they work, hundreds in general.
00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was wondering where the hours came into the equation. Okay, so, because I thought you said that I like got more calls done.
00:16:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, this is actually wrong. Yeah. She only worked 80. Yeah. that is right. Yeah. that's right. Yeah. That was wrong.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ally is actually working like double speed. Yeah. that is significant. And let's, I mean, if we were gonna have to do even math. mean, that's roughly like 50% more.
00:16:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how to use percentages.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you do? in this case, you would divide 1.52 by 2.46 times about 100. No, just divide. You'll get the same thing.
00:16:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just move the decimal point. That's all. Yeah, she's doing 61% more. I don't know it.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that doesn't make sense.
00:16:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's. Yes, she's doing 61% more. Yeah.
00:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because if she was doing 200 percent, we'll see.
00:17:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
she's doing 100 more than that would be 3.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. So she's doing 60% more.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then two people. So either one of them is very slow or both of them are slow. Or maybe she's just super fast and we do have we do get lucky sometimes and get because like Mark Scott, this girl Samantha and she kills everybody. She smokes everybody. She is a massively driven. You can't just go get us a man but you can't. So that might be what but it's worth looking into. It's worth considering. Do we share team numbers? Do we drive internal competition and incentive by saying here's the targets and here's the and maybe we don't want to because like the other issue Mark has is way too much incentive in his program and he's paying too much in payroll for it so we have to do the math before you offer any kind of incentive program but for sure at the very least this is something we need to be contemplating and not just look at and take it and go like okay that's dinner and not do anything we're there to be such a big disparity either you've got a rock star or you've got slackers and if it's a slacker situation then that's something that can potentially be trained potentially be incentivized or potentially you replace them but either way it's something to be thinking about
00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you want to look at China?
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see her say hi. Oh, my gosh.
00:19:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. Hello. Yeah, we were just going to go take a nap and say we're going to say hi to daddy and then go take a nap.
00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I missed the little one so bad.
00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, so beautiful and perfect.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's just a perfect blend of the two of you.
00:19:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. It's hard to tell her right now. I know they're so young. Yeah. Just trying to get to sleep in her own crib so she's not like contact napping all the time. Oh, just like you can't give anything done during the day.
00:19:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember that battle and I wish I had leaned into it way more than I did because that goes so fast.
00:19:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You cannot believe how fast it goes.
00:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I shouldn't try to train her out of it too quickly. So here's the thing. you sleep very well with that Puji?
00:20:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I sleep better without him.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We both agree that we sleep better like separately. Everybody is different but it's been interesting you know because I've got two that are all the way grown. I've got two grandkids and two that are mostly grown plus sisters and siblings and just working with people along that. There's this huge, I don't know, we all listen to different things and feel different things but trying to get kids to sleep alone and and parents get frustrated that they won't do it and those people, most of them don't want to sleep alone can't sleep alone and it's funny that they want really tiny children just to be able to be alone and be comfortable when it's not the natural thing. are cultures that are never away from their children. They pack them onto their backs. They don't mean you see that a lot and co-sleeping is just a lot more common and other cultures around the world. Yeah, so but you know when you're a driven mama and you have an active brain and you want to use your brain That's an important thing to and taking care of you is an important thing, and so it's difficult But the one thing I would say is whatever your heart calls you to do Lean into your heart more than your brain Your brain will get outlets later, but if you hurt your heart that damage can be So long-lasting and that's where the regrets come from not helping your brain I promise you Okay, that's good advice.
00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to take out more of your precious hour with Tina, so Thank you wanted to show you something else that I am working on You want to So, okay, so this is where I really Can you coach to step in over the board? Yes, but yeah, I'll just show you what I am done.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, the Bing.
00:22:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bing background. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I have an online clinic and I have a company. We haven't like we just sort of started, but we market this thing. You get a brain MRI.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see my screen? I can and you told me a little bit about that.
00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, yeah, so anyway, I just, just kind of, we're just starting. this. And again, the payment structures are fluctuated, but essentially my cost for this brain scan is $1,000 of my cost, and I'm reselling it for $2,500. So each sale makes me roughly $1,500. And yeah, anyway, so that's that. I am just starting it with the founder of this technology. So anyway, I spent all yesterday night making this payment platform and this website and getting the bank account set up. So finally, everything's ready to go. have the business registered, I have the bank now, I have the website. last piece I need to do is just structure the clinic side a little bit better because I'm serving all 50 states.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and where do your customers come from?
00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right now, they come from the company itself. So this company BrainKey out of Germany, people email them from the United States and it's like, I want to get your brain scan and since they don't have a US presence, they are sending them to me.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they say, hey, you have the machine that can do it, basically?
00:24:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, we have contracts with the imaging centers. A lot of the same ones Mark uses for his PI cases, actually. I just go to them and get a contract with me. Okay. So that's why it's the $1000. So the $1000 is about 800 of it goes to the MRI center where I send them and then about 200 I send it to BrainKey to analyze the results.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the value is in BrainKey's evaluation and reporting or, okay, you give me a little bit more about the USP, which is the unique selling point of why, why then?
00:25:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, they're the only brain analysis software on the market that can do these volumetric measurements. So if you look on this little screen, they're sectioning out the brain based on what structure it is, and they actually measure how big it is. So we could track over time pretty clearly, like if you're developing Alzheimer's, you're going to see this really specific area of your brain, unfortunately, strength, They show that that part of your brain, the amygdala for alcohol actually shrinks, shrinks, shrinks. And we could see it get bigger when you get better sleep, when you stop drinking alcohol, et cetera.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And who's your target market for this?
00:25:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you have an avatar or multiple avatars? Yes. it's usually it's Asian males that make over 150,000 a year, they're single or not single. But it's Asian males over 100, making over 150,000 a year that would be. between the ages of 40 and 50 and, like, 58 to 65-ish.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that demographic is within your realm physically?
00:26:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
A lot, because most of them tend to live around the major city centers, where I have the contracts with the centers.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why Asian specifically?
00:26:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I think, I don't know. not sure why it's Asian. I mean, obviously, I think the majority is like, they're like, it's 50-50 Asian white male. I'm not sure why. I personally think it's like the midlife crises that these people are dealing with in general. Like, why it's a lot of males and not as many females.
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could give you lots of reasons why it's probably more males and higher earning males, just because what got them to the higher earning was very stressful on their bodies. They overworked.
00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
probably during too much did all the network too much.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They did a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do and have gotten to the point where, especially now in this world, we're very aware of the clock ticking but as well the opportunity and the medical technology that can buy us another decade or two. Whereas women, not as competitive, do a lot of things that are better for their hearts, they talk to each other, they've got a network, they're more aware of health in general and probably haven't neglected it to the extent and are also less likely to go and pay and spend this amount of money on themselves for their health or rather they'd go get, you know, breast and butt lifts so they look good for the man because that's not really for them, that's for somebody else kind of thing but the psychology behind it makes perfect sense to me to say it's part does not necessarily make sense to me and it's not really necessary because You don't have to, in the marketing, target anything that would be Asian specific, but the reason I ask about the avatars is because you do want the marketing to speak to them wherever they're at, whatever their values are, and for sure there's a, there's a huge difference, I think, between Asians period because of the collectivist culture with just the standard American, which is the individualistic culture, the values, the reasons, the logic for doing things is different. And so, like if you were going to, and I don't really know how much that applies to Asians living in America as much, but anyway, just the language, right? So are you doing this for yourself versus doing this for your family? And you would probably want to split test some of the messages. We would probably want to have a few different landing pages and keywords research campaigns. based off of what's happening. What I would be interested to know is what they know about marketing that works in other areas and what they would be willing to share with you.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the only one that does this here. Yeah, so that's what's interesting about this opportunity to me is because brain key right now is only sold through brick and mortar concierge clinics. So the only way they're getting customers is they go to a concierge doctor and says, hey, give this to your clients and those are their salesmen. I'm like the first mass market clinic for them. But yeah, but because of that, you don't really have a good sense of like who they're, you know, who's buying it or why they're buying it because all there's, they see the data, right? They see how old the person is male or female, just from the scan data, but they're not actually talking to their clients, which is really interesting. It's like, yeah.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea what percentage of doctors are Asian in your area or in any of the metro areas? Just wondering because culturalistically, more, let's say any other nationality to Asians, you're going have Asians and like Filipinos, which is a mix between Mexican and Asian, right? There's a huge drive to be doctors. So, I was wondering if the correlation just happens to be that there are more Asian doctors and they're pitching it to Asians because they're like, hey, I think you might like this more than some of these other people that don't, I don't know, like I'm trying to figure out what could that possibly, or could they have got that demographic from? anyway, my brain, I'm always trying to analyze because if you understand the demographic and the true data, then it makes marketing that much easier.
00:31:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I just, yeah, the company, even like the owner, I, and I'm friends with the founder, he's just like, sorry, man, I like, I literally don't know because we don't sell this. It's only the upstairs doctors that sell it to their own clients. And yeah, like, I was like, well, do you have numbers? And he's like, well, not really.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your, when you first thought about this, and up until now, what was your plan of attack for marketing?
00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I actually talked to Mark a lot about this, and it was really just to run Google ads. our thought was as long as I could make, you know, as long as I can make $100 more than my ad spend, it's very straightforward business, right? Yeah, I'm just, essentially, just reselling this product. I'm like selling online.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has, has Mark ever mentioned Dan to you?
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is a client that referred Mark to me that we do work together and Dan's very good at Google Ads and also Google Analytics. So especially because this is a new market, we're going to need to make sure that you've got analytics and that we're watching it closely. We're going to want to have a heat map on here. Do you know what a heat map is?
00:32:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Kind of like where they're looking and clicking.
00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're also going to want to watch the behavior to find out what they're coming from. I think that some YouTube ads would probably be the most leverageable thing and the great thing of course is that combination between YouTube and Google is that you've got all of this data and they do, they're just really good at targeting by the algorithms, know, who might be interested in that. So if they're doing something that's relative like looking up a particular issue whose solution is you need an MRI. Guess who's at they're probably going to start up. Who's running ads for MRIs? Like nobody probably. I don't know. Anyway so creating some YouTube ads would probably be a good idea and a lot of that could probably be done with AI videos now. You know of course we could actually hire some people but most of it could be some either stock videos or a few like videos of the machine of the reports things like that with a voiceover which also could be AI. It could be a voice actor which we could pay very inexpensively off of Upwork something like that. You have a good voice. I think that's so weird but you're not anywhere near the first person to say that. I hated my voice until I was like mid 30s and Now I won't do video because I feel so gross and ugly. mean, I spent all Saturday. I spent my time doing videos for marketing. Can't do it. Anyway, this is life. We've all got our weird things.
00:34:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Anyway. But I was so excited, you know, I feel your excitement in this. And I think the same thing as your keen in on is what makes me excited is because it's really something that if I can get the marketing right, this can make a good, good, like another stream of income for my family, you know, if I could just make, you know, 10 sales a month, , that's, that's an extra, you know, 120,000 a year.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm really happy with that. You then have a massively targeted list of potential other things that you could offer them. So now you're not going to know what their test results or whatever.
00:34:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is that? No, is one of the things that, yeah, I wanted to sell because the one of the. The big things, if people take a test step six months and nine months, if they sleep better, you can easily see their skin improves.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was one of the things I was going to key in on, was like, um, what are we talking about when we first started talking and talked about naps and Steve and all that stuff.
00:35:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:35:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, having like a list of people willing to, willing to pay money to improve their brain. mean, yeah, I think well, a significant amount of money and also there's, there's more to it than that. So you might have people who are willing to pay money and invest in their health, but this avatar is scientifically minded. This avatar is not just about health improvement, but this guaranteed is going to be about life quality and longevity. And that's a whole new level up here. Okay, right? That's not the person who's like maybe trying to cut sugar. out of their diet or be on a diet or whatever. This is the person that is like this is serious, this is important and so I don't know how much you studied marketing but if you were to study direct response there's a guy named Eugene Schwartz and he what's it called breakthrough advertising. You would do really well to study it that book is dense it's owned by one of my clients actually so Jean is referenced so many times. He talks about levels of awareness so you've got the I know nothing about whatever you're selling market all the way up to I know everything I'm just looking for the thing to buy. There's like seven levels of awareness and if you get to the point where somebody has bought this their level of awareness of brain health of what is needed. How do you avoid amyloid plaque and not get Alzheimer's? How do you, like, could you as an affiliate offer have some sort of brain training program and software that you create by yourself that helps prevent Alzheimer's? Like, there's so many different things, and if we're looking at you being in this business and having the compounding effect of additional revenue streams where you're, it's scalable and you're not doing it for your time. This has long tentacles out into the future that, and you can build it, and then somebody would probably go buy it from you for, like, $20, $30 million if you were smart about it because you're disrupting right now, nobody's doing this.
00:37:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair. Alzheimer's is a great thing. This is actually one of the first campaigns that I wanted to run was actually run a campaign for Alzheimer's.
00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what if you, so have you heard that ultrasound waves are now able to... to break up amyloid plaque and that is the first thing that they've ever found that can reverse Alzheimer's. Yeah, there's been no way to get rid of amyloid plaque until now ultrasound, which makes sense that that could do that, but that it could safely do it.
00:38:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting.
00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm also a medical nerd. study a lot. Health and longevity is a huge thing to me, so I like working with you.
00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good.
00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't tell I'm excited in my brain lights up about this, but anyway, if you found a service like that that you could also offer as concierge or make referrals or something like that, you already have the market. Oh, your scan came back with. And so because of HIPAA, you're not going to know anything, but what you can do is say, hey, you know, if you get results like this, here's what you can do. If you get results like this, here's what you can do. Now, HIPAA doesn't allow you to like ask questions per se or whatever or know the information, but they can self-select and I'm interested in this. So you have cause and effect. They select this, therefore, you know, probably assume the correlation and now you start marketing to them this type of thing. And then we get into email hygiene and how much better that makes your inbox, placement and all kinds of other things because you're super segmented and.
00:39:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I guess that's why like I and that's the tough thing right now and I wanted to kind of get into too about like, you know, my time balance because, you know, we have we have something good going in July. And, you know, that's why like, you know, much how much my time should I be putting in July to kind of really pump, you know, pump my July business. We have the Q and is, you know, that we're making some changes to be more efficient on, you know, I guess, is this now a, you know, is this a good thing to really go after the delta, you know, I call it delta.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll tell you my overall strategy for everybody. And first of all, business 101, the verification. Your best bet at success is multiple types of things going on. So the first thought that I just had when you went back to July medical is, you know what, that's probably the way to build the funds to, you know, make sure that you've got everything that you need over here to invest in some marketing, to invest in some good advertising. Because if you're not, if you're going to do this, do it, do it right. Yeah.
00:40:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's not a, you mean delta?
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah. But the other thing was I was like, well, maybe that just takes off the bumpers off of July medical, and you grow as big as you want to. And then somebody gets attention. and then and pulls you down. You're like, okay, bye done. But the insurance take care of its job of the liabilities and whatever happened to you and be like, okay, pull the plug on that. Moving on, thank you for the signal universe.
00:41:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah, and it's kind of just and you said that too, because we're, you know, I'm looking at the total amount of AR that we have and we just passed $5 million in AR, which is about one point, you know, if we get a 25% return, that's close to that's close to 1.5 million. So I think if we keep even just at this level, we're accumulating AR at about about three million, four million a year, just at this current level. So yeah, it's a good point that, you know, even in five years, if I get pulled down by insurance, I'm going to have accumulated, you know, close to 30 million in AR probably by then.
00:41:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not only that, you now have some assets, you have doctor referrals, you could pretend actually sell something, have some sort of asset that is sellable, so maybe it's not the entity, but maybe it's the contacts, maybe it's the business relationship, and if you go and tell all these people that are referring to you and you go really vet the person, so somebody buys your business from you, which isn't really a business anymore, right? Because they have to do their own name, whatever. But what they're buying is the insertion into your network, and this person will be so vetted by you that you go make a personal recommendation to all of these people, hey, this person's gonna take care of you, I'm trying them on this, this, this, this, and this, but you actually don't really even need the reputation anymore out of integrity, you would do a good job, but let's say they didn't, let's say you vetted them wrong, if that bridge is burned, you've got all these other things going on anyway. That's a good question.
00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good point. Yeah. Yeah. and that's the thing that You want, it's not invincibility, but it's, you want to be shielded from whatever can go wrong or if you're making the risk, it's a educated and it's an educated risk where you're, you've got everything coming. So you've got Delta when you've got QME and, well, no, I know, but I'm at July goes.
00:43:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah. So, and I'm sure that other things are going to present themselves, um, as you, as you, as you go.
00:43:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:43:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, especially with whatever related to, like, if you get into the ultrasound stuff for, for Alzheimer's, first of all, that information needs to be so much more widely spread because it's such a big deal, like we lose people. Um, New, but the knowledge and the science behind it for the most part isn't new. It's just we found the missing piece and nobody knows about it yet. And it needs traction. And the other thing that we know is that government, health care, pharmaceuticals, whatever, we're going to do their best to keep that down because drugs are big money, sick people are big money. So you've got these two different competing markets. You have a great way to to to to I don't serve and leverage in there.
00:45:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we actually hope that this, you know, this price point, we can actually lower it in the coming years. We think that the MRI bills will be lower next year, you know, just because every year the price seems to come down a little. So hopefully this, you know, we'll start to be able to offer this at like $2,000, for instance, every year. So like you're saying, hopefully this diagnostic piece will get cheaper every year. And then, you know, you pair that with the technology like treatment, like all just sound, that'd be really cool.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can they use like a health savings account for this?
00:46:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have to apply through government, but yes, you have to get a tag.
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the two things I would try to do would be to get that as quickly as possible. Because you want to remove friction from anybody who wants it as much as possible. So they can use, especially because entrepreneurial type people, if they don't have the insurance, we'll have HSA's because this probably wouldn't cover it in most insurance anyway, depending on what kind of diagnosis they had to begin with. And then the other thing is a payment plan. So there are lots of different services that you could sign up for that would give you a payment plan. And those two things right there are going to help remove some friction points right away. And then the other thing about a higher price point is that it allows you to offer like referral discounts. So refer a friend and you know, they say $500 or you say $500 on your next one or that type of thing. And you still preserve solid margins, but you know, that's the whole thing about marketing. They have the feeling that they've saved money. And the fact that they can't go get it anywhere else serves you a very good purpose right there.
00:47:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I like that. Yeah, I just asked Chat TPT to show me how to register my business to accept HSA after spending, like for Christmas time, that might be a good thing.
00:47:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of year. Yeah, I love that. And do you have targets? So you should talk to Mark and see if he thinks that you and Dan might be a good match. Dan doesn't just take everybody really what he does is he builds the websites. And the reason for that is because the speed, he needs to control the assets so that we can get really clean data. And that's, he built this whole thing for that purpose because it's really hard to get accurate tracking, but ads don't work very well if you don't have accurate tracking. So, he does that and he just likes puzzles and he, but he's very good at running Google ads in a way that almost nobody does. It's very low cost. So, anyway, it's interesting like when I first told Mark about this business, I actually, because you see how much I can afford to spend on this.
00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was actually, I actually went to Mark and said, know, should I hire someone to do my website, hire someone to do my marketing. And I thought Mark was going to say like, yes, yes, and he actually made me think about it a little differently that like, what is your business really? And so this business to me was like, it's really just a marketing play, right? I'm not, I don't own the brain scanner. don't own the game. the report maker, the brain key report maker, I'm just the reseller. And Mark was saying, you know, you should have at least a beginning understanding of how to create a website, create a payment processor, and also how to, you know, run a base Google ads because he's like, he was telling me like, he can't tell me how many millions he's freelessly spent on. That's exactly why right there. And he said, like, once you, you know, once I figure it out, when I run a couple campaigns, then I can go out and hire, you know, really cool people. But he's like, you need to understand the core of your business. And I was like, okay, so yeah, that was actually that was my plan is to actually run, you know, one campaign, maybe put $10,000 in it and run it on Alzheimer's.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so I understand. You know, want to tell that was funny.
00:49:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, so that's not even that.
00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's why I wouldn't recommend anybody but Dan. And he is not the best. at creating the campaigns. He is the smartest when it comes to conserving money. The thing about all advertising agencies are they are, you will bleed out the jugular.
00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's how bad they are.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark is right because when you understand the technicality of what's involved and they want to give you a $10,000 a month fee, you're going like for what? For why? No. Now if you want $10,000 and you got me a million dollars. Okay. Right. Or you know what I mean? Or even $100,000. 10% marketing fee is totally accessible. But most of them are just ridiculously priced and you have no concept of it. Most people have no concept of it because they've never done it. So now you have, and Mark would tell you if he thinks it's, I would be curious to know what he thinks.
00:50:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I haven't run the campaign yet. I'm probably going to try to do that next week.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yes, you should. that everybody that does business for themselves should know a little bit about all the things really should. And the reason I have the business I have is because I did all the things. I've done graphics, I've done web design, I've done programming, I've done building the products, I've taught, I've done all the things. And so when I go with somebody, what's that?
00:51:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, hold on. I was saying, yeah, I think that's a great idea to talk to some of Mark's contacts. Once I run my first campaign to try it, I like it.
00:51:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we keep kidding.
00:51:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like, it keeps coming out and I don't know if it's my internet or yours. Oh, I think I need to stop the share here. There we go.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.
00:56:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so maybe I'll just target July. So because now for July, I have quarter one and quarter two. I actually wait, are we done with quarter? So two quarters of data. So we can look at that.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we'll be almost done.
00:56:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I can get the monthly P&Ls and then you wanted quarterly P&Ls. Yes. Okay, maybe we'll start.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want the whole year and then I want quarterly. Well, July, I would like monthly.
00:56:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I'll get it since January and then we can go over those next call.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds good. So, physician, physician, oh my God. Physician recruitment, why my tongue does not want to work. Um. I want to know, um, let me see how much you've given me already. I want to understand. Entry the exit for your money, like how do you earn the money? You've told me some about it, but I want to know what that if there's any leverage point, if there's anything that you can do to increase that, let me, let me start with that. Do you think that there's anything that you can do to increase that?
00:57:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can talk about ester stuff if you want to medical director. I want to understand deeply like, explain what that is and how the money comes to you. And then also we talked about your training. Um, Q and D like test prep, I think is what it was. And, um, we started getting data on that. And what I. I had asked for was, I wanted one spreadsheet that had the overall snapshot kind of data for each of those businesses, which is the revenue month over month, as long as you've been doing that particular business, and that would incite questions for me that I can start asking you, but I really need to be able to see that revenue and know a little bit in terms of like where it comes from. So the assignment and I would like to install the there's a repercussions for not doing it next week, because it would be a waste of our time if you don't have this we're we shouldn't it should have already been done. Is that I want that and I need to make sure that you're clear because I did ask for it before. And you can tell me if you get too busy or something like that, but I want revenue for every type of the business, so you gave me I'll just list them one more time. All right. right. All right. right. All right. All Physician Recruitment, Medical Director, and the licensing exam test prep. I want to know the revenue month over month from each of those, a description in the same spreadsheet of how you make that money. What do you have to do to get it and any kind of information that you can think of as to what you might be able to do to increase it? All of those before we meet next week and I want it, we're meeting Monday. I want to Friday. It's Friday. Wait, wait. It's Thursday. Okay. That's not fair. You're lucky. All right, you can have it by Monday morning and we'll just go into by then because I wanted to go over it, but I'm not going to work on the weekends. I got the girls this weekend, so we'll just do it Monday. So if you're prepared with all of that, then we will have a good day.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
call. Oh, sounds great.
01:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Should I keep putting time into this delta thing? Or do I need to put that on the back word?
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it light you up?
01:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I really like doing it. But you know, I see the money that I can make with July like we talked about and refinements to the QME. I could be better at that.
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's the thing about creators and visionaries. We don't usually stay on one thing really well for long without feeling frustrated, annoyed, irritated. You have to have some freedom to go other places. These are existing businesses that you've already defined and chosen. Now, if you want to say you want to go chase something else that isn't even on your plate when you've got all these things going on, like what are you doing? Stop. Focus. But it's already here that you're already doing it. nurturing it would be good. once we get to the activity, that I'm talking about and we have evaluated all of your income strains and then chosen which ones have the most leverage and then made a plan for it. Then you need to try to stay within the bounds that we've created but those boundaries don't exist right now so you know and we don't have any reason or logical placement to put boundaries in so if you've got time and you're not neglecting other duties then then explore it but you should be mindful of you know sleep routine and hygiene and family that's the only thing I would always say no matter what we're talking about. That's fair all right that's good and dirty all right it was awesome talking to you foodie hello Esther I know it's your time but I really like that and makes me happy so thanks for letting us say hi. Yes you're great all right thank you.
01:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay bye have a great night.

Hey, hey, how are you?
00:00:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good. me just grab a glass of water. just realized I don't have that for saw my desk.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on.
00:00:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have a fabulous weekend?
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did.
00:00:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed it.
00:00:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, good. All right, my water.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm already looking at flight for next time.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Alexa, stop. Okay. So I was hoping we can just open up a Google Doc and just knock out details of the offer. Yeah. And then, um, I don't want show your screen or my screen, but I didn't want to show you one quick thing. I just put together. they're like over the weekend just finalizing it now. This is what I put together. She had this is one of the two gay clients. And she sells ADHD stuff for kids, but also this child custody binder, that's why she was taking a long time to decide what niche to go after. So we're starting to after this one and the whole parenting niche. But I'm really proud of this.
00:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks awesome. Very good.
00:01:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyhoozy. So yeah, so pretty proud of that.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. That's awesome.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
she happy? Oh yeah, she she's I'm very careful with her what she spends because she's like really been through a lot and doesn't have a lot of money. So I'm always helping her above and beyond. Without a doubt. But yeah, she's happy with everything. Whenever she gets on a call of me, or if I help her something on her Shopify e-commerce store, she makes money. And unfortunately, one time she had someone else help her for ads, and then the ads went tagged after that. So, but literally, she's someone who only has like a budget to spend like $25 then ads. Like, that's it. That's why I'm saying I go slow with her.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but yeah, she's, she's happy.
00:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My biggest issues, I really don't want her to spend a lot of money on tech stack. So I'm probably going to transfer this. That's what's been taking me the long time. I think I'm just going to transfer this to system I owe for her because it's so much cheaper than anything else. And has email, everything. But I'm just going to tell her, I thought I would do it. screw it. Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list.
00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? What was her domain?
00:04:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen again. I don't know what her domain is for selling the 900. I could probably find out if I dig or into it.
00:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've been trying to say to be different digital wealth, like academies and- Yeah. It's digital growth academy, but- growth.
00:04:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is only the 47 a month, right? This isn't selling the 900 thing. So, um, I don't know where in here, like I'm in the community in the classroom. That's the only thing that's weird. And like, she'll has Texas sport calls. Anyone who buys the $900 gets free access to this, I think membership. So, so everything that's in here, um, and she does this, you know, like 90 day success sprints day one day. Like, it's, it's really good. I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, you and I would create with full value transparency, giving value to people. Um, or we could just become, I was even thinking, just become a damn good affiliate for her because a lot of people are pursuing early, like she's gotten all these wins, like all these people making sales. She's got, look at all the pages of sales. What's that? sorry. I just had a funny message. She was like 18,000 and 32 pages of wins.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rosie, do you think it would be helpful if I join and pay for that? So that we're studying the same thing because here's the thing either we're creating our own path and just using it or That it will be what I do and we do it always should be but I Love modeling after somebody who's doing something similar to what we want to do and making a couple tweaks and I feel like if we're Number one it doesn't work with school to share logins or whatever and for the price. It's nominal Anyway, I'm just kind of study that and be on the same page Because it's low ticket because so you think that she's you know Telling the truth not really the bro marketer club.
00:06:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Just kind of She's definitely a bro marketer and you know who she hires in their dual mindset coaching is the same female mindset coach from LA That was on sunset that Netflix show sunset and I watched a little blurb of the mindset coaching. It's pretty good I think what amazes me to two things to you. What amazes me is Um, her, I'm just going to give this link to you. She's only been in this for two or three years and she was, I think, in network marketing and then she switched to this and one of her friends or colleagues, just like how you and I are connecting, one of her friends colleagues, it was a really good web funnels and tech stuff. So that's why they decided to create this because they figured that's what was missing. So I think she had a big boost from the start of all of her MLM people because this is so good for MLM people, right? To eat up and find another revenue source.
00:07:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if we want to focus on such beginners. So that's my only thought process.
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, so here's her Instagram thing that this is what her real thing is. So she calls it the free daily pay blueprint PDF, zero six, three or six months coming to here. So this is what she gives you. If you were to pay $900, you get this whole system as well. So you enter your email and then sends me the blueprint and then she's got this legacy build program and I think it goes into a webinar. And of course, she's, this is all in school, like, She just started the school community not long ago either, but she's just growing fast.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're probably one of those ones I kill it in network marketing and really, you got to talk to people a lot and you got to work a lot to do that. Oh yeah, I think is.
00:08:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Go ahead, sorry.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's one of the things that is a big something I always want to pay attention to when I look at somebody and look out, why are they successful if they're successful because they're working constantly. It doesn't mean that I can't take what does work and then figure out how to make it work well or just set different goals. you know, maybe she's got 70,000, I don't need 70,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, like, you know what I mean? It's a whole different level and also, I mean, how many people does she have to have to support the team? What kind of margins does she have?
00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What kind of headache is all of that management?
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, they look good. All the different things and it gives It's exciting, you know, when you see these big platforms and these big numbers, but it's it's really easy to not take into account the cost of that and I'm sure you've done this as well. Worked with a lot of these people in the back end and they're just burnt out, they're happy on the outside and on the inside, everything else is falling apart, their health, they don't see their kids, they don't see their sweethearts, they, you know, there's a lot that you don't see and and the other thing is the difference between like extraverts, introverts and amberverts. I'm an ambervert, so, you know, like I can only spend so much time with a lot of people. I light up, I get energized, but then I'm super drained and I have to recover so I can't do that all the time and I'm not seeking out opportunities to be in front of people, but also if I spend too much time alone, I get depressed, introverts are like, let me be alone. Yes, I'm right there. I'm right there in the middle. Now, you have to take that into account with the business model. I would say I would think you lean more towards extrovert, but probably in the like, but so if here's a spectrum, here's introvert, here's ambivert. I mean, here's extrovert. Here's ambivert. would say Tina is probably right around here. Maria's maybe just a little bit over here, slightly more extroverted, but still probably doesn't need to be with all the people all the time. Yeah. Well, am I right or wrong?
00:10:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, totally. Totally. know, and I don't want to be a me too product. I'm going to be honest. Like, I think what we've been talking about, thinking about is really powerful and, and, you know, it was solidified even in my mind today when I saw Alan's post today about how in a nutshell, he just said all the people that he's helping. in his fast forward scale to like $100,000 months or whatever, $1,000,000 months, there's no more messaging of here's how to get five to five more clients, here's how to make more money. It's the messaging that really works is just having like that work, like work life balance, right? Which is what we've been talking about, right? And I believe in it, like a simple, anyways, we don't need to go into all details of that, but yeah, so don't buy it yet, you know, because we may not want to go that direction because sometimes what beginners deflates me because it's hard when someone comes back to you and says I only have like $20 a day to spend on ads.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And actually, I think that that's not a bad budget for, for trying things down starts even our seven and eight figure clients with a dollar a day or to $5 a day at budgets and does well. But there's so many things that are an uphill battle for beginners. They don't have perspective and I don't I don't have the energy to want to impart low-level perspective, like the getting started perspective. I can give you impart the perspective of, all right, you've got all these great things, and you're doing all these great things, don't get psyched out and play smaller than you can be, but I don't want to be teaching the basics. I want to teach and offer that as a done for you, like just self-paced do it yourself. I want to teach it because I think that the way that I teach it is different than everybody else, and we'll resonate with the small group of people, and I just want to offer it and let God bring the people who need that, and it's its own thing. if I'm going to work one-on-one or in a group or anything else like that, I need it to be high-level, or at least mid-level, so for doing hybrid coaching, needs to be mid-level. We're experienced, we know a lot, We don't know it all, and we need some hand holding, but the group can kind of hand hold also, you know what I mean, that's that mid level. High level is, I just need you to catch me when I'm screwing up. Tell me the things that I don't know, and then I'm going to go off and do my thing, and I'm going come back and report, and then we're going to do this again.
00:13:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's high level.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't need a lot of hand holding. I love those people. I barely talk to them. They're my favorite, and they adore me, and likewise, so for us, I think getting started really targeting that mid level person, where we can get some exponential kind of like results, some like raving fans of like, holy crap, you know, this was just, I've been here, here, here, here, here forever, and I just went, whoosh, but I did this without getting really stressed or trying to follow somebody else's thing that doesn't fit me. And that's what I want to deliver to people. And then what I want to do. as while we're doing this for people and making the money that we need to and want to, is figure out what did we do consistently with every single person?
00:14:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What was the process?
00:14:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the fundamental questions we asked? Which I mostly have out mapped out in my course that I started. But how could we improve that and so give that to people and then maybe we scale it up and we do a few more of these. Maybe we train some, because there's not enough of these people in the world, there's not enough high level coaches that are really good that can actually serve and take care of people. And so maybe we can train junior coaches or something like that who are really good at walking through this process that we've taught and completely outlined. And then maybe once we have a team meeting where we meet with all of our junior coaches and they say, here's the issue, here's where I'm getting stuck, or this is my plan. And what do you guys think, run it by us? Like, we could have a whole kind of school of ourselves. I've literally never thought this thought before ever. Yeah. So this is all just, it evolves, it evolves. It just keeps evolving. Because I'll tell you what happens. If we weren't talking, I would talk myself out of all of it. It was starting to do it.
00:15:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, no, that's why that's why I forced myself to launch a member of what it is. I said Tuesday at 6 p.m. So that's like girl in like five hours.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like, I don't really have much to launch.
00:15:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I'm very good, I don't know you noticed this about me. I'm very good at teasing people and getting them excited. I've got people already saying, I marked my calendar for 6 p.m. But the thing is, here it is, go buy it for $100. This is going to be like, this is the price, take or leave it. But I have been torn between something that Josh Gavin actually said, because I'm in his little community, because he just called me in. And he's interviewed me about the success of how to float ticket offers. Hasn't be able to take it offers and I respect him, but he sometimes in his group. He's so cute He puts out somebody should do this offer and he'll just list out offers that you should do right like he says I'm too busy to do this. Someone should do this because I would buy this right or and so his latest one He says he says whether one or all of you do this go for it I thought that actually is brilliant He says someone should offer a pocket cmo offer Where for like whether it be 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month or whatever a month You are the pocket cmo where they could twice a week or something Send an illume video to you about what their needs are like what they're stuck on and then you within like say a two day turnaround or 24 hour turnaround send a loom video back to them, right? he said for instance for him He would pay that for someone he doesn't want to hire someone like we're an agency for 5,000 months to run his ads or anything But he would love to if he's ever stuck or what to do share a screen and show someone something and then get the tips from someone else Um And I know my friend Cara who runs all the ads for like soon with Claire and she like paid herself I'm like, why did you do this? really good at what you do. I remember she paid $1,000 for one hour or one guy Who who proposed to be a Facebook ad scaling expert? And she said oh it like I knew more than him I'm like, what did you pay for the point is I thought that was interesting with our skill sets as well pocket CMO, you know And when I started I remember do you know who my kill is do you remember internet marketing? Super friends.
00:17:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so Somebody people would always try to ask me to describe what I did and it was really hard because no role that I had found ever described it and then Matt Gill was a good friend. I don't know if you know him from nitro marketing Not that well, but I know him. He has a name Yeah, so he's like Ops you do operation. I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. So then I was like Okay, I'm COO for hire. now they have fractional COO. And I was like, yeah, that's that's definitely there. But that doesn't make enough money. I would not do it for anybody because they don't. It's not positioned and valued right for for the level that I do and brain. But I wish if like if you have that post, I'd love to see it because I'd love to send it to a client of mine who would be that that would be a great offer for him pocket CMO. He does the fractional CMO but I like the pocket CMO.
00:18:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like that level of access because it's more leveraged.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to need this. I got to remember I got homework to do now schools in session. Um yeah anyway okay so let's see screen sharing our offer.
00:18:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which you want me to share it or do you know yeah however yeah yeah. Okay.
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, was it the Maria Tina partnership one?
00:19:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what? We have stuff in there, but I just created a new doc and it's not good. I don't even think I've shared it with you. So I'll just put it in the comments here now in the chat. And I will share screen right now. I have the other ones open too. Done. love it. But, you know, obviously starting to work less, have fun and have a life. And then do we just want to say one on one mentorship?
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Opportunity? Yeah. I love that. 20 plus year business veterans like, you know, how long have you been doing this? before I I did it online, which is 22 years. It was six years in corporate. And it was for a call center, but I was still managing metrics. And it was basically a business within a business, the call centers work. Because I did my own hiring. I did my own staffing. I did meet my metrics. I had to meet my contractual agreements. So in all of that actually prepared me for what I do. So I would say I'm closer to 28 years with business experience.
00:20:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I quit the big six consulting firms in 1999, 2000. So I guess 24 years.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're close. I would say nearly 50-year combines or we'll say 25 plus whatever. However you want to do that, it's close. Because if you want to be real about it, I also and you did too a paper route for a couple years and all the other things. So if you out of my business years, I've got 30 years under my belt for sure.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that makes me old.
00:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ha. ha ha And this is a mouse. Oops.
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's that that let's break down full stock.
00:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Okay, for this. I just wanted to put this in before. Forget. Yeah, yeah. Because the feedback I'm getting from people that I did do some one in one calls with, by the way, I do have one in 15 minutes, so, but I get back on with you after that.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just, just, okay, this was only scheduled off till one 30 my time. So that's why someone snuck in and booked.
00:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's yeah. Yeah, but I'll be available in an hour after that two, three, my time.
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm but anyway, you are not looking for money this meeting an hour long because that Tuesday.
00:22:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have gone the whole weekend.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they have it.
00:22:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Action. I don't know. So yeah, we can go back to the full staff. Yeah. So this is what resonated with people when we were talking just back and forth about so many things to build on the business that you feel called to serve this component, but it'll give you emotional support, support, support, support. really, I think, resonated with people in the PS of the email that I sent a couple days ago, and then you saw some of my Facebook posts that are resonating with people. Maybe it's just cutting out what's in my Facebook post that I wrote on the weekend or Friday.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The one I tagged you with. I don't know if you saw that one. I didn't even so.
00:23:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I quoted you in it too.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was off. I was like, I'm not online at all.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so this one, timeless principles for building a business and it's kind of summary of what we do and it says, what are my good friends to? Marie says, I take you on it. And it said, the offer match to the audience Trump's brand power all day, branding, just sports, organic traffic, so it was your words there because I wanted to slowly bring in you. But, yeah, so it's a long post, but I was talking about, you know, there's so much crap out there. And maybe I just can't pace this because people love this post. Yeah, you know.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, let me, oh, go away. I've missed a lot, like apparently the swarms are terrible, and just...
00:24:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want stop share?
00:24:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I just want to... I have my settings so that things that I'm tagged in don't... have to be approved to get on my wall, and like I'll still show up, but I wanted to do that. Go check this for you. Yeah, and then I can go... Wait, wait, that's not it. Oh yeah, no, sorry.
00:24:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no words, no.
00:24:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Yeah, I see... I'll read it from here real quick so I can see all your... What do you call it? Words? please, but can I just get to my own profile? There, okay. Absolutely brilliant post. Nice job. thing you say, video or write means everything to me. Oh, good. So that's like, I may have heard a version of some of it when I when I hear it from me, it downloads directly from my brain, can't get enough. You have got to keep that as a testimonial and use that, Maria, because that's the thing. That's the type of comments and things that people say to me. This is what makes us most unique.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you talk about?
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a comment on here from Colleen held Ladwaib and she says, everything you say, video or write means everything to me. I totally get it, absorb it. And it's like, I may have heard a version of some of it. But when I hear it from you, it downloads directly to my brain, can't get enough. That is a skill that I have as well too. I that is so unique. I don't I don't know that that I've ever read read anybody say that about somebody else. I'm sure that it's there. I think like Alan and like there are certain types of people, we have, we connect with other ones. So you and I both do a little storytelling and correlating of a technical and tactical concept and put it into life in a way that people can just like go wait a minute, I get that now. You've got a, you are the class from the pulpit side. What we the teacher saw was someone without their ego, I'm gonna cry, getting in their way. You were there to learn all the questions they came at the right time. You followed instructions were first to finish the exercise, give me time to dig deeper. Those are really pioneering days of internet marketing.
00:26:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that's my software friend. That's interesting too, but just he'll always couch it with edifying him. He'll never fully me. Oh yeah.
00:26:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm, that reminds me of Seth Laraby. Like he, You did a lot to lift people up, but you'd always be like, my student, my this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, even teach what you're talking about. Like, he did that with me a couple of times. I'm like, you understand that this was not because of you.
00:27:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, yeah.
00:27:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but yeah, okay, you know, I've been walking just you do such a good job of, I mean, even the emojis, the number emojis, I've never think of the number emojis.
00:27:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because sometimes it takes like two, three hours to write one post. So that's why I've been warming everyone up for the last 14 days too, to video post.
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So, okay, what? Man, you've got to go soon.
00:27:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sucks.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is the best way to use this time to support where your brain has already been going because my brain can go off of on a whole different ten right now.
00:28:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think probably the stack. It's even happened in webinars. I'm so good at the whole webinars. I'm right when it comes to the pitch section of showing the stack or what they get. I fall short a little bit on bringing the power to that. So people convert because they know me. But maybe at the end of this document, I'm just going to say here's what's something like that. What's waiting for you or here's what you're going to get or something.
00:28:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I type in then you tweak because it works better for me? Yeah, that's how I thinking.
00:28:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. whether you want to do it as a table or they just like, well, let me format it. Let me just bring dump.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for that work. Okay. a so first.
00:30:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You Whoa, sorry, sorry didn't do that. thought I could add it.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, it shouldn't have done that. No, yeah, I was trying to add my own stuff at bottom, just to give you a If this helps from the post, if you talk, I'll lose what I'm saying.
00:37:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, you have a call.
00:37:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I got a dash. If you scroll down, I also put Josh's post in there in case there's any burby ash from there that you want to add about the pocket, CMO and CFO.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. I don't want other people's rides. I just like, it was going to be fractional, but pocket was cool because boxers in the pocket.
00:37:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
no, I love it.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. Talk a couple hours or yes, I have calls into like two o'clock and then I'll need a little break and then I have to get my daughter.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm not sure, but let's at least box because traction got it. Okay. Cheers.

Hey.
00:00:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hey.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. a little bit of running around today, this morning. Yeah, your ends up kind of stuff. But I've finished up a quiz automation in those building or updating for 10 and get that over to him to review before I publish it.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. How's that going with him?
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
mean, it's going well as far as I can. As far as I can tell, you know, we his Facebook group has like 7,800 members and it's hard to get good engagement, good response or get steady responses on the post. So the ones that do best or when it's like, hey, I've got this cool thing I use in my gym, who wants that kind of thing. And I did a post like that last week and said I need get like 50 comments to share the ads that Tim runs to bring in new leads and appointments and that's up to 77 comments now. Oh, Yeah, so that was good. So I think I'm just going to start doing more of those. And then we're. I'm just doing a Black Friday promotion. Well, it's not his Black Friday promotion. It's a webinar, where we're selling a done for you Black Friday promotion for Jim. So that's happening in the middle of October that I'm teaching that. So I've written a lot of the, most of the promo copy leading up to that and then just updating some language on the registration page.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did it take you to get 50 comments?
00:02:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We got to 50 like in three days.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. And what kind of budget did you have for that?
00:02:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's all organic. That's awesome.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's in this group. So how's the conversation going around your working arrangement? And how are you feeling about it?
00:03:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I own my follow-up back to a gross summit So sending is before gross summit. send an outline of of how how it would work with me earning a percentage and at the same time I updated my recurring charge to the three grand And So I didn't even just follow up on that email and and ask him if If he's had a chance to review it He took I guess he's got a cabin somewhere up in North, Arizona and he was there for 10 days or so Available but I've taken some time after the event, but he's back in this week.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So what are you thinking about your conversation? how would you?
00:04:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How are you framing it in your mind? Well, I later all out in the email. So it's, I want him to respond to that either via email or getting on a call and in the hammering. You know, just talking through the details, but it's like, you know, I want to be, I want to be at 5k or 5k a month for the work that I do outside of, of Titans. And the way I frame it is like, you know, I'll be incentivized because to make that, I've I've got to basically to make an extra 5k a month for, or I'm sorry, to make an extra 2k a month on top of what he's paying me. have to, for the year, I have to sell 400 grand for him. And that would, that would generate 24k for me.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That's how I talked about it in the, in the email to him.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I see that? Would you like screen share real quick?
00:05:39 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'd love to see what you put together. Yeah, let me find that. Thank you. Can you read that?
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That sounds awesome. You'd have to be just so greedy and stingy. Thank you. know that.
00:07:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a it's a good deal.
00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Heck yeah, it is. And so well, I love the way I you did such a good job, like you covered all the points. So you did the simple math, you wrote down the caveat to you wrote down, you know, what applies to what and what doesn't. You like you framed it so simple, so clear. No brainer. I know people are dumb enough to say no to stuff like this. It wouldn't make zero sense. So but then you know what you need to know. If somebody can say no to this, you know all you need to know about them. There's it's not they're not rational. They don't value you. and the work that you do, because by definition, you'd have to have earned it.
00:08:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. So, yeah, exactly. mean, I think that, you know, there's a possibility for somebody to say, another possibility someone would say, no, is that it feels like they're not confident that that we'll be able to get an accurate... No, that's not what I'm saying. Like, for example, this Black Friday promotion that's coming up, you know, Tim's created that webinar. My job is to get people to the webinar. He then sells them on the webinar. And then we've also got, you know, email follow-ups to people who attend and don't buy. And so... And as I'm talking this out and maybe this goes to your point of stinginess, maybe the nicer way I would frame it in my mind is, yeah maybe it is stinginess, it could also be like him thinking, you know, I created the webinar, I'm selling them, and he's just running the promotion. So maybe like a not not valuing, not not seeing the value and the work and effort that gets gets people onto the webinar, I'm totally making this up, this is not anything you said. I'm just trying to like, I mean, some of it comes down, could come down to just like some laziness too, like not wanting to have to think about how much percentage does Chris get, which which I mean I guess to your point would tell would be an important data point for me as well and I mean basically if he may come back and say well there are some more deals I'd want to exclude from this and I'm open to that because I don't know everything about his business I know a good bit but I'm open to the idea that you know I've got a blind spot and I'm a reasonable guy but so we have a conversation if he thinks things other than the gross summit should be excluded and at that point like if we can do a deal then I know I've got a ceiling here with him a 3k a month and and that's sort of like the clock ticking on you know But with me to get me where I want to be. But yeah, I think it's a no-brainer for him.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, so right there, highlight it. 24,000 is what you get if you generate 480,000. Yeah, he did all the work or whatever. That's Trump change really for what it is. And like I said, if you want two things or both, stingy or doesn't see how you're that valuable. But getting butts in seat and qualified butts in seats is a real value proposition. You could have the greatest product in the world. You could have the greatest pitch in the world. If there's nobody there to see it, doesn't do any good. If the right people aren't there to see it, doesn't do any good. So that's what you're doing. Yeah. know, it's it's it's brick and mortar business.
00:11:57 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's location, location, location, right?
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Offer in the world greatest pet you greatest from mama pro promotion and you're out in the boonies Nobody's ever gonna see it. Nobody's ever gonna buy it. Okay, so that's what a digital offer is until You have somebody writing the copy and doing the ads you're doing both Two things copy on its own no good without ads and people seeing it Add on its own. Oh good. It's not good copy good offer. So You know, yeah, that is all that is a it's two major services you're offering That in and of themselves That that fee Yeah, anyway, yeah, it is great So yeah, I'll just reply to this email and The just do one more thing in the example so that there's no like sticker shock So when you go 5% of 27,000 he's not doing that much like $1,300 or something like that.
00:13:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's like almost all right.
00:13:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we if you look at that and be like, okay, I'm still not even paying you $5,000 if I make $30,000.
00:13:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would put that number there because you look at it and goes, Oh, you generated $30,000 and I'm still not even paying you that $5,000.
00:13:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
was paying you before.
00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, yeah, that's a good way to put in parentheses.
00:13:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
$1,300.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would put which brings my total to $4,300. And I think it's like, it's probably probably $13.50. Let me go do this. So what the heck? $27,000 times 0.05, $13.50. So that would be $43.50. And I would put that total there in the example and go, which is still less than the five.
00:14:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
a thousand you were originally paying me monthly. Yeah.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's the framing of that. That makes it go. Okay. Like honestly, he should feel crappy because you got downgraded, but you are upgrading everything that you're giving to him.
00:14:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, he's and he's tossing like more, more, more my way.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you doing your effective hourly rate calculations when you're doing this work with him?
00:14:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I know that I want to keep it to five to six hours a week. And like today, I worked, I did two hours working on this infusion self automation and so I knew that tomorrow I won't spend as much time on his stuff. So I calculate your real time. No, I don't have a time chakra, I know, because my morning is my time that I do this kind of work. It's like, I've got my Tim and my Titans buckets. And I usually just write for an hour for Tim. But today, I don't know, because I need to actually build this automation, which I'm, and I documented it for him on a one-pager so that he could just see, because there's a lot of stuff in this automation. And he should see that and recognize what else I can do. What else I can do? Like it's a beast. Yeah, that's also an asset that he owned forever more and also that he could replicate and sell like Yeah Yeah, like this so they had done They had the bones of this built because they've got a they got a quiz they built this quiz Which which like so they they had like this This This built what I went in and did is I created a Nurture sequence to bring people into the quiz And then I'm pulling them out if they've already gone through the nurture sequence and then the big thing they want to sell is called business accelerator and Yeah, and accelerator I know I know and I'm saying be a and I'm in my character advertising, so it's like But Then these people here, if you score in one of these tags in the quiz, then they were putting them into a business accelerator. These were the emails that they had up there and they weren't really ready. I created this sequence here from the promotion that I wrote for them in June or May or June and it's pretty nice. set it up so it runs on specific days so that this promotion is always ending on Monday when people go in and then when they finish it, there is a tag that completed and then I'm giving them a soft docked out here so like not interested in getting my help to hit 30k. a click here or move from this promotion. So they can click that instead of unsubscribing. Right. Takes them to this page. And I even link to the promotion so they can look at it. And when that happens, they get tagged here, soft opt out. And then I'm looping them back into this hold. And inside of this hold, it just holds them for five months. And then kicks them out and then checks to see are they a business accelerator customer. So they go here, if they're not, then I'm going to put them back into the nurture sequence. And then anybody on the list that is not, so I created this check to see if they've been through the nurture sequence. So you can. Not anybody into that and then it'll go and see arcade have they been through the sequence before If they haven't then they're going to go straight into it if they have They're going back into this holding bin For the five months and Yeah, so though like those things are the things that i've built and And Added for him so i don't know that he's looked at the shot but Uh, his partner randy has and and really likes it And so i just put together this Wrote this up this morning so he could read it just to see the flow Like if this wasn't high level that kind of snapshot could be sold for a thousand dollars like that automation in and of itself could be thousands of dollars I get annoyed when people don't value you properly
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You already made that money drives me nuts.
00:20:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. mean, I think Tim's got a lot of money flowing out.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. But here's the thing. If you want more to come in, then you pay it to the people who bring it in. Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying and the people that help you keep it or and the people that help you keep getting more out of your existing assets. Like, that's the thing. It's there's a lot, you know, so many majority people are spinning their reel and it's feast or famine and it's their fault because it's the way they operate. It's the way they manage their business and you come in and you bring structure and leverage and consistency, which reduces stress. That stress relief is a real world value. That's a real life quality, real currency, real value, especially because reducing that allows him to operate at his higher level, which is where he is able to make the most money and not go crazy. Like, you want to get in the habit of learning how to express that that's what you bring into the table. And then one of the ways you can do is say, my goal is to block, right, to take off this load. And you can even insert things like, you know, I study psychology, I understand Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And I know that when we're stuck and we're in the vicious cycle, like, we just aren't operating at our highest level. And so when I'm coming to the table and I'm coming to the team, my job is to make sure that there is no, you know, pain and suffering. that we're all operating at the highest level that self-actualization, right? That's where we're delivering the most magic to our clients. That's where we're feeling the most magic ourselves and our teams. That's where the money flows, but not just for us, for our clients. And then they're able to deliver their best version of the product to their customers. And so I don't want you to think you're just getting a copywriter or a guy that does ads. Like, I'm, I bring all of this to the table, and hopefully you've already kind of felt some of that. Like, you want, so you might notice a little bit that it's not so dark anymore, right? But there's a whole level of degree of lightening that happens between coming over the mountain and high noon. It's so subtle that you really don't notice, but there is a distinctive difference in the level of light and warmth that happens in that process from like say 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
00:23:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At peak level. And it's so subtle, it's almost imperceptible unless somebody is really paying attention to, oh yeah, look at where the sun's at right now and think about the warmth that it's giving and think about the light it's giving. We don't, we take it for granted, but where would we be without the sun? Right. So it is human nature to just kind of be in the warmth, bask in that light and that glow that is just offered and not notice it. So you have to help people notice it.
00:23:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's a good point. I do remember when I first started, Tim was Vlad and surprise that I knew how to use a diffusion soft. Yeah. and that was just being able to send broadcast demons. Um, but he, uh, will be the first time he's seen me build something a little more advanced.
00:24:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'd be like, boy, I'm just getting started.
00:24:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
come on. Let's go. Tim is like an expert builder and infusion soft. So I know that he'll appreciate it.
00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but he didn't have to do this. Like you saved his brain power and like, like, I know you can do this, but I know you got higher level things to do and saving you super power. I like doing that for you, you know, like, maybe don't love doing it.
00:24:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it's, I do enjoy like thinking through, uh, I'm not like, a, uh, a bill. But I do, like, thinking through how to, like, how these automations flow, that is fun for me. But I don't think I'd want to be building these all the time, I'd get, my head would just be too full.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There are so many people that you can get now that are low-cost overseas that, like, like, five, ten years ago, there was hardly anybody that was good at it. They weren't great at it. They weren't engineers. There are engineer level type automation specialists for $15 an hour, you know, that you can get, who get most of this. And so if you have a few maps and say, okay, go replicate this, but insert this type of which is a lot less moving pieces. and waiting for the campaign to open and to load and to give the attributes and all of that so they can do the actual connections and logic which takes more time and you can just kind of brainstorm it and then you've got basically these different maps and templates but then you're also thinking about the nurturing sequence like it did now you're talking about the customer experience so you this is tip to tail entry to exit your this is not copy this is everything from the beginning to the end other than actually fulfilling or doing the live sales but everything else you are touching touching and nurturing and optimizing and leveraging and that is high high value you're like several people in one for $3,000 a month. Don't just, ugh, don't let me see this bull, okay? All right, all right, right, all right.
00:27:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So yeah, I got to follow up with him on this, on this email and and yeah, I feel like things were, things were going really well. With, with 10. Everyone seems to be, everyone seems to be happy.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something to be said for going through it with people though. If, if they will reward you, you know, I've done that a lot of times and you stay, it's just, it's just different. Like I do business different, like we get in and it's like we're putting an elbow grease here in the trenches with people. That is not the most. Leverage thing to do in terms of instant revenue and return, but it is extremely leveraged in loyalty and The the depth of those relationships and how long they last and how long they continue to bless you is Is is very different and for me. They're more fulfilling When you know you brought somebody through it and they know you brought somebody that you helped bring them through it it's it's a whole different kind of thing and You know, you don't you don't just get that in any type of Arrangement, so that's something to think about to you know There's there's always trade-offs in the types of deals in business that we do, but it would be really nice to see you connect with somebody who you know is doing eight figures and Okay, um would like somebody to spearhead marketing and important prove the offer creation and look at what money are they leaving on the table, you know, and just mastermind what's happening. You don't do the copy, you can approve it, right? You don't do the ads, you can approve it, you don't do the automations, but you approve it, like all the resources there, like that would be, that's ideal and you should be getting paid a good amount of money for that, $10,000 a month. They'll be happy to do it because they don't have to think about it, they don't, yes, they're paying for all the resources, but they don't have to manage it, you're managing it well, you're giving them a report of this is what it costs us, but this is what I've made us, know, all you're doing is just getting information from them and then reporting information back and they're getting paid because they built everything up to that point and now they need somebody trustworthy to manage it and that trustworthy is the operative award because there's not a lot of that.
00:30:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yep. Yeah, I point. It's interesting with Tim, know Brian too, it's so easy for me to, I know what the offer is, what they're doing, get a little bit of their personality and their voice and like, I don't run into the same kind of like mental roadblocks doing this for somebody else that I do, like if I was the face, you know, like if someone's coming from me. And I've thought about this quite a bit and there's a part of that whole world of like being, being the guy that. feels, prison is too strong of a word, but it feels to me like I would start to feel trapped of like having to the pressure of like having to be on all the being the face, but I like that because I've got these, these things that come up as like, oh, just doesn't feel fun to me, but at the same time, like when I was doing wookers. I didn't feel that because, you know, the different, a difference there was we were selling this tool and, and I had a customer support team and so if anybody had trouble using the tool, it was just like, send them off over there and I've got, I've got this idea for a software that I've been researching a little bit to see like what's out there, but I first wrote this down when I was getting started to learn a little more about email deliverability and, and I was working with Adrian Savage from email smart who I still work with him in his team was, was solution that would take leads that come in through your regular forms and automatically input them into an infusion soft form behind the scenes so that if somebody is opting in through for lead magnet or even a purchase on a non-infusion soft, and this applies to any ESP, or CRM, but that it would then take that information, put them into, you know, get the tags and everything from the Thrive themes form, put them into a infusion soft in the background as a solution to be able to mail the people who are opting back in on your third party form, and sell that as a
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a as a software solution yeah I mean I wonder I wonder what the demand is for that but I'd like you thinking about SaaS again something I've been thinking about too is is just really kind of different leverage offers so I'm the same way with you know wanting to be the face and always be on I hate it I did a video and I boosted it as an ad on YouTube and it was short and it wasn't even good it wasn't made to be an ad but I did it because I have to push myself out of my comfort zone to an extent I don't have to but there's a lot of leverage in showing up and I want to do that on TikTok but I don't like doing it myself so I found this lady she's been around like 20 years and really I Ideally, it would be somebody like me would be my ideal business partner, because personality, energy, values, language, all of these things are important to me. But being able to have somebody that's in integrity, she's like a female version of a lot of these male marketers that I'm just like, that language is not, but she's not. She was just a woman in man's world and so kind of adopted some of this stuff. But she has been making other people millions and millions she's made millions, but just and she's like mid 50s and she stays home and takes care of her mom and but so much time spending and taking care of other people. And she's but she's all over the board because she's got this hustle mentality. You know what? I can just create some structure for you so easily. And we barely talked and people are like giving her comments like, you're back. You're amazing. Your energy's amazing. You're this. You're that. And I'm like it doesn't take much. I love that. So what I get in return though is she's really great at marketing She's all over the board for herself, but for other people she's really focused Yeah, and she's able to get it done and she loves showing up on video and she has no problem with it And I'm like, you know what we could do to talk lives together And I only have to show up long enough to have a conversation with you You she loves talking about things every morning. She's writing an email every morning. She's doing a video And I'm like, that's amazing like so I'll just let you do most of it I'll do my part and I'll bring something to the table, but she's never been served the way she serves But I would do that you never been served the way you serve and I think Finding that person and they're going to be somebody like you that's just they don't act like a face. Really maybe they do sometimes But they are just consistent and the way they show up or or they're really inconsistent and they in the way that they show up as the face and then they disappear because they are all over the board and so they need a rock like you right they like you know being on video and they like talking and they like promoting but they don't know how to run things smoothly so they're always working they have made lots of money for other people right but not as much for themselves so just starting to like kind of put out your feelers and your intentions to attract somebody like that that you can align with who knows they don't want to do it by themselves but they do want to do it and they want to show up every day just not by themselves because of the riffing because of the face because even if neither one of you really wants to be the face you can do it a little they can do it little you can do it together that energy feels very different it's not like being on it's just like talking to them and kind of taking that, capturing it sending it out. So like we were talking this morning about her and I just doing conversations on live on TikTok because the audience there is so, there's so much of the untapped, Facebook attracts the people that are in the old I am crowd, The hardcore marketers. So they bring in the people that have been brainwashed and you're competing with that. TikTok is all over the board. These are people like just hearing the ideas for the first time. And so they don't have these predisposed opinions about what things should be, whatever, and they're just easier to persuade. They're not jaded like people on Facebook. And so we can go over there, have some conversations, take the, so do TikTok, TikTok likes consistency. have to show up. Tube likes quality. YouTube does not care if you're consistent. YouTube just wants you to create something that people want to consume. Stay on their platform. They will send your one-year-old video over and over and over again, as long as people are still watching it and they don't care if you've never created another video. So we can take the best of the clips from TikTok and turn that into a quality YouTube video. Put that over there. The thing about YouTube is it gives amazingly targeted low-cost leads. So without it feeling like a drain, it will just feel like I'm showing up talking to Maria but we're doing it on TikTok live and it doesn't feel like pressure because I'm just having conversation with her and people are observing and I would do that anyway. I don't have an issue with it that I wouldn't think about it so much. Whereas if I'm talking to a camera, it's exhausting to my soul. I'm looking at myself going, this is
00:41:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So douchey, I hate it.
00:41:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's it's not it's necessary, but it is not organic and not natural. And I don't like it. And I don't want to do things that don't look so I don't. Yeah. Anyway, but I know because we're always in this evolutionary evolutionary conversation about what is your offer kind of what is your thing. And I think that for most people it should be a hybrid. So I'm not going to give up my high level clients, and especially like my doctors and my attorneys, I'm having the time of my life with them. Because these are people that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, in in going to school, they're gonna be a debt for a long time. They're just used to paying for knowledge. And they're not like, I gotta make $10 million by the end of the year. And I need to make $10 million for every $5,000 I spend with you. know what I mean, debt service, he's like Tina, finally, I've been trying to tell you that you needed to like experience this. I'm like, I know, I know. But, um, but he's like, last night, he's like, I'm so glad that you're finally out of the IM world. I'm like, babe, that's never gonna happen and I'll tell you why. First of all, I wouldn't be where I'm at without having taken this path. But second of all, when moms and dads are trying to figure out how they save their family and how they get this extra income and they have no other way and they go to the internet, the first people they're gonna run into is internet marketers because internet marketers are the ones spending all the money to advertise to them. So I need to be there to show them, look, yes, there are all these opportunities, but here's what you need to do to guard yourself. Here's how you run real business practices, but you don't have to have an MBA and you don't have to be, you know what I mean? Like, very few people can simplify it like I can and talk to the average person and watch out for them. And because I have. of my other clients and my other business. I don't I don't have to charge them an arm and a leg. I'm planning on giving some of my best stuff away for free on YouTube just to be like learn it. And here's what I know because I've seen it happen with people over and over again. You give away your best stuff. Really smart people with a lot of money didn't have to pay to learn it. So they're watching you they're going, you know what? I want to hire that person and they will send you an email be like, how do I give you some money?
00:43:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How do we work together? Yep.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ten to thousands of dollars and deals happen because somebody saw you thought you were smart but you have to show that instead of showing all your schmuckery and your like 10 million upsells and downsells.
00:43:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? I mean that's how Tim came to me.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm saying.
00:43:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I threw the bootcamp.
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Saw your smartness out there. Like I got to get that guy.
00:43:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah maybe.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So put more stuff out. but it doesn't have to be your face. That's the other thing and I got to remind myself of this because yes it's a popular thing but people don't care if you're screen sharing and they can hear you and there's and there's like cap cut and script make it so easy to caption what you're saying and if the captions are right and you know how to do this because this is marketing magic and we do this right the headline the hook they need to see the right things and hear the right things they don't have to see your face so much and it could be your picture which is not the same thing it's not the same burden it's not the same energy cap cut and a script and loom now has AI editing so it's crazy you're just like oh take out this line and it automatically does it you don't have to go through that how do I like zoom into the timeline and get right to that one second and clip these words oh my gosh it is crazy easy how fast the stuff could be done. So whatever you want to teach, whatever offer you want to do, if you want to do it yourself, do it the way that you want to do it and trust that it's it's going to work because you teach simple, clear, fundamentals, you teach fundamentals too, because you've been studying the fundamentals from gene.
00:45:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.
00:52:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
A lot of that is I go through the exercises that I created for BAM on Desire and Product Performance, the channel, like channeling desire and market sophistication. Yeah, mean that that could technically be a that's interesting. That could be a series with the goal. I'm not selling a core or some selling like working with me.
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it could just be a soft like at the end. like if you, if this is something you want in your business, and you don't have somebody driving this, let me know, like I'm, I'm not the cheapest guy. I'm not the, um, the laborer. I'm the profit partner. So if you're looking for the, the guy to hire that works for you, I'm not the one. But if you're looking for the guy to be, you know, a profit sharing partner in your business, let me know. And it used to be soft. The other thing is you would drop in there. This is the exercise that I use that I created for BAM.
00:53:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
BAM, by the way, is right through advertising mastery.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it is a companion guide to Gene Schwartz is this, because I am partners with Brian Kurtz.
00:53:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so now you've just given your pedigree.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's going to be powerful too. But it up there. Right now I'm douchey way, like just like FYI, this is where this came from.
00:54:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's not a bad idea actually. If I looked at it as I'm not trying to sell a course, I'm but selling my services. Yeah, I hadn't really thought about it that way. It's funny like Brian and I, Brian just got invited to speak to this virtual. But to this group of marketers in Japan about breakthrough advertising and he looped me in. He's like, I want Chris to be on this call with me. This guy, Hyro or however you say his name, H-I-R-O. he's got a little community there in Japan studying breakthrough advertising. And. So, Brian are going to be speaking to them in December, and I mean, who knows where we'll come out of that, but it was like, I wouldn't have gotten invited into that if I hadn't done all this stuff with Break to Arotize it, so that was just reminder. I, do you know Esther Kiss?
00:55:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? Yes! She's awesome.
00:55:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, I don't know if she, I got a, is an automated email, but she reached out, she got on my list, and one of my sequences in the profit sharing thing, she replied, and asked if I was interested in any kind of PR or media work for me, and I'm not, I'm not interested in that for me, but then I was like, huh, it across my arm before, was like, uh, thinking of Break through Arotizing, like, if there was a more of a PR strategy for that book in media strategy to talk about like isn't this a cool story that here's this book that's almost 60 years old and still you know changing lives and we could talk about you know run some media about it kind of even showcasing it as a collector's item and and and and just go go out to a little bit of a broader market non people who aren't copywriters but I think that there could be a cool story of the history of the book and the story and who gene was and and just kind of build the allure around around this text and so I'm gonna I'm gonna do a call with her and the and Brian
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to see what what she thinks about that As an approach Esther is so smart and she is so Real so humble like she's just she's she's one of those people, you know, just I don't know I think she's the same no matter what yeah, and I don't think she likes playing the game. I think she loves what she does and And loves when she comes across real genuine people and knows how rare they are. She's one of those really rare people Tell her I said hi we talked to her Yeah, she just we've never done any work together, but we You know when you you've got that just kind of vibe from somebody and you interact and you like for me I have these little love affairs with these ladies on Facebook and just like just adore you. I love you You're so smart whatever I gush they gush It's it's a mutual thing and then you don't talk to people for years and then it happens And again, and it's, it's just kind of amazing. I don't know if do that, but, but we women do that. Like you just really see each other and you're like, you're awesome. I think the men do too, because I have that similar interaction with men. a little bit different because you got to be, you know, respectful. it's very, because you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. like, wait a minute, he's married.
00:58:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're married. What is happening here? like, no, no, not like that. But anyway, yeah, right, right.
00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, she is, she is, that would be really interesting to see if there's any kind of synergy there. And I wonder with Jeremy also, just because she does PR, he does podcasting, very similar kind of. It's a different path to this, to the same type of thing, which is awareness, brand awareness. Yeah, really. That's what podcasting does, right?
00:58:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Brand awareness and education, right?
00:58:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just pure, like a direct. response to marketing, which is a different type of psychology. It's it's like surgical marketing to me is what direct response is. Podcasting is like explosive marketing is like here's all the stuff. And PR is also surgical but it's like it's just it's not I mean it's it's I don't know like it's like getting stitches versus getting heart surgery. You know what I mean? Yeah it's interesting. Really keep. I say keep but because we've talked about it but I don't know that it's a big thing but that is the thing that I've been thinking about you since like 2020 2020 started talking about networking community is the people like that that are just really family or truth oriented like Esther doesn't have kids but she is a she is a mama kind of heart you know what I mean like she she she mamas her people and is loving and nurturing like just like you can tell that she loves her people yeah and making money is it's not a make money at all costs and it's they very much care about their relationships and I feel like I don't know you you also have much different values than just making money yes finding those types of people and having exploratory conversations with like what can we do together how can I help you help me but what can we create together and especially in terms of like content that maybe you can put out out on YouTube knowing that if it's quality, it can last forever and just be a beacon to the person, God will send them to you because he's amazing with that. Yeah, yes. Anyway, I'm excited about everything. I feel like I shed the last bit of the snake skin of COVID. You know, like the whole holding back, like it was happening around the beginning of this year, which is wild because that was a long time. And now I'm like, it's not like it didn't happen and there's not real things because we feel the after effects, but it is that I'm not sitting down for the next 10 years. I'm not taking it easy for the next 10 years. I'm not to burn myself out, but dude, I'm going to school. I'm on a mission. I'm doing all these like partnerships, taking care of my kids too. And I'm exhausted and I'm the happiest I've been in.
01:02:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
in a long time. That's awesome.
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Being exhausted for having labored well is good. But also I nap like two or three times a day sometimes. Yeah.
01:02:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Naps are awesome.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. I love Naps. Yeah. Okay. So let me know how Tim replies to you.
01:02:23 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't go all month. I mean, I guess if you're feeling great about things, but I'm still here. I'm here to do feedback on anything. Oh, my stuff. I don't even know. Like you can tell I'm all over the board. I don't know if there's there's stuff for us to do or not to do, but I don't want to waste your time when I get to it. And maybe I just keep helping you with yourself or whatever. And we just maybe we share the back and forth of here's what I'm working on. Here's what you could add to it. Here's what you're going take from that kind of thing. but yeah you we we got to get you to what you really deserve you've been running fast.
01:03:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah it's yeah I mean no pressure you know how to reach me if you want to kick some ideas around. I do have I did get an introduction to this young financial advisor here in town because I found somebody in TXL that works in the financial space with advisors and I've been I've been really interested in wanting to explore marketing and selling these infinite banking concepts and so I did call with him yesterday and he's not really into infinite banking but he does know the financial advisor space and so he he said there's a guy in Nashville that he does about half million a year he's like mid to late 20s and he did this great True to this guy. He's super responsive. So he and I are going to meet on October 7th. And he's got a podcast that he does. I just want to learn like what he's doing and let him know what I'm looking to do, which is I want to create the marketing. Like I don't want to write the policies at all. Like I don't want to get into that, but I want to sell them to people. And if I do this, I can get my life insurance license over weekend and then earn the commissions of the policies that I help sell.
01:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I keep forgetting about that. And you know, Business 101 is diversify. That is the best moat against poor economic times. The money is not Ever going away like ever. It's always out there and and we have so much access to it, but the average person isn't thinking about it. They're not trying to. They're just worrying about it. You If you have different areas that you can get to, but they're not consuming and they're not taking all your time and they're not taking all your energy and you're just building a machine like an engine, right? We've talked about around each of these types of things in the beginning, they're way more work and investment, but then you get in and you figure out how they work and you figure out how to leverage it. But I love that. And I love it being in, you know, the financial space where you can get money working for you plus the helping other people do the same thing. Like that really feeds the mission that you've always had, which is give back help others. And in terms of like business, but I think it, I don't think it had to be business. think business was the vehicle that you had naturally, but I think. Think that like kids you you so the proper type of stuff like huge I think you just want to see everybody be free powerful and happy and it doesn't matter how it gets there As long as it's something you're interested in you want everybody else to have it which is also about you Free powerful and happy I'm gonna write that down And those I want for people All right, I gotta get my girl. Oh go get her. Yes. All right. have a great day It's great talking to you and don't be stranger

Hello. Oh, shoot.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on my iMac instead of my laptop. I've got about the audio. Oh, well, I guess I don't even know what to do. I'll just deal with if there's weird audio issues and I need to set a reminder from myself. It's weird. It's only you. That is just so weird. But it changed when I was on my laptop. So it's not you, but it only happens with you. Isn't that weird? I just don't know what it is. right. Anyway, how are you doing?
00:00:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? I am good. I wish that teamwork had a way of removing links quickly and like changing their formatting. So like if you wanted to format everything to be a particular size instead of let's say paragraph or heading one heading to whatever, you can't highlight everything and switch it. And if I wanted to just highlight everything and remove any links, I can't, I have to remove links one by one, which matters because if I'm bringing in my notes from battle, it's full of all this other crap and formatting and teamwork is just not a good text editor. No, it's not, which, you know, whatever. But it's kind of a basic function and most things can do better than teamwork can. And since it's organizing tests, for projects and things like that. I think it might be a little bit better.
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's cool. It's because you're cutting and pasting some editors just don't like cutting. It's like when you cut and paste something into like Gmail and it does this wacky formatting. You're like, I was at the component in like this other app that I have that just clears out every problem or what it's taking off. But yeah, so I'm with you.
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, huh, I use this app. Yeah, but the problem with that is when I do that, then everything is a single line of text. Yes, then you lose the breaks. Yes, no paragraph breaks or anything. And so that actually takes probably more time.
00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That just depends. But anyway, so there's my tip. I use this app on clutter.
00:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I use it constantly. I'm a big fan of the app. Is it a Clutter or a Clutter?
00:02:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, app and is it like a desktop app or I think yeah I think it's App Store does top up pretty sure it's in the App Store.
00:03:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've also available on the Mac App Store.
00:03:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It gives you this swipe down note pet but so it that will keep the breaks it just strips out all the stuff so I use it to like keep instead of having to open notes you just swipe down and use this thing. Mine's littered with info but it's I use it constantly.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay let me just do this. Remind me to get the unclutter. App at 2 p.m. Thank you. Okay that way I don't have to bother you. So how did music creating go last week?
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I finished some drums, I finished the arrangement on one song, and then I finished the drum on the other, and I wrote this is like the first time, I think it's first time. Lately I've been hearing parts in my head, which I don't normally, I hear melodies sometimes and vocal parts, but I never hear like a guitar part or a piano part, but I've distinctly heard this piano part, and I was like I gotta, and I just, it was like stuck in my brain, it's been in there for weeks, but I didn't do it because not only did I hear, but I heard the sound that I wanted to sound like, so I laid that down and it totally works, and then I've got this other one that I can hear a part for, so I'm like alright, I'm gonna go do that one, and that one has a very distinct sound, it's basically like, it's reverse, essentially, it's like this reverse. as well. So I'm like, okay, I know exactly how I want it to sound. I'm not sure how I'm going to get that sound. But first, I got to find the notes that I go find the notes. So that's what I did with this one. I just found the notes, plated in on piano and then applied, went and found the sound.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome.
00:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder if, you know, how you spend more time doing things you evolve. And maybe just, but it's not just more time doing things, but more time just more time doing things systematically. You have been much more systematic in your approach to creating music. And so like, maybe you just leveled up and your brain is like, I got something new for you. Yeah.
00:05:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
mean, it's like the drum, these are probably the best drum parts I've programmed, I think. And now, and then I can go. Like, I went and listened to stuff that I did like two years ago and it's just unreal how bad it is. God, it's so bad, but so you can hear the progress there and then I also, I did a lot last week. I had this idea for a song that I had like a guitar part and then I had a vocal melody and some lyrics and I had like this idea so then what I'm that involved Nashville tuning a guitar. So I had like this, I had the string sitting around, was like, I had a string, I guitar and then I strung it and I started playing the part and I like, Ooh, that does sound good. I'm going to go record this really quick. And then I realized, oh, wait, I could just turn that into a loop and pop up and the next again, I was like, I figured out how long the song was and then I quickly like laid down some scratch vocals and then That one I you can hear it like me when I demoed it or when I did like the work tape. So what I do is I'll have these parts and I just listen to them when I'm in the car and that's when I usually come up or I'll listen to it in my house right but it's usually I'm listening to it and then I'll come up with the idea and then I have to like play it through the phone you know I'll dump it to my computer play through the computer and then record on the phone and then I'll sing over it recording me and the thing coming out of the guitar part usually coming out of the computer so for that one I had this vocal melody idea and a couple words and then I for sure was like and then it's gonna get I didn't say this in the thing and I was like doo doo doo doo doo like yeah then there's drum parts gonna kick in that's all you can hear on the tape is me going doo doo doo doo doo doo doo so then I did that I was like okay well then this is where the drum part would come in then I like I was telling someone this the other day, I listened to this obsessively, like obsessively, I'll listen to it 15, 16 times in a row and I'll be listening going, oh, I gotta change that. Oh, okay, well, I'm gonna go try this. So I start to hear these other things the more I listen to it. That's, so that came together and then there's that that's the one that has this reverse well idea that I can hear so distinctly in my head. Like, I hear it when I listen to it.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't know how to make that. Yeah. I mean, like, if you have, do you have a synthesizer?
00:08:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I'm sure you have all the tools of just being able to get in the habit of being able to take from your head, get the similar enough sound and then just plunk it on and record it. But I Okay, that's so cool.
00:09:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and the one that I did do, I have to actually figure this out. So I didn't write it like Dan, Dan wrote it. But I'm pretty sure it's in the key of G. It might be in C, it could be in D. Like, I'm actually not sure what key this is in. But the piano part that I wrote, it goes, but it's, it's like the relative minor key or something. It's not the key. I know by looking at the notes, like, this is not, these notes are not in this key, but they could be in the relative minor, and that's when they work. But whatever they work, they don't sound wrong. So I'm like, oh, I'm not sure what I'm doing here, but it's not I'm putting on. And maybe something will tell me later on. You can't do that. I'm like, and yet I did.
00:09:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, holy crap. I just tried to unclutter for a second and then I pieced it and I was like. Like, what just happened? It did the thing, but then at the very bottom, it was a whole bunch of links to it. OK, Dan just sold me on my new tool, the hall. I can't that. It will make my note-taking better, because phallom is great. And it allows me to do, like, just now listening to you. And I get phallom to highlight the notes to see, you know, is there anything that I want to remember to talk to you about later? But if I'm trying to write it down as it's happening, I miss stuff all the time.
00:10:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. So you can actually create multiples. Like, if you look on the right, you'll see, like, a plus. When you drag it down from swipe it down, it slides in. I'd never do it, but you could have multiple column notes or whatever it is.
00:10:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so one more. Yeah, the example did that. So it had, well, I had clipboard file and then notes like it looks a little complicated and I my brain feels overwhelmed so I think what I want to do is just go watch a video um to really get it because it definitely seems nuanced um and not super like point and click intuitive but that's okay because if it's doing what I think it'll do uh you know it's worth the organization anyway okay cool so music is evolving that's awesome how do you feel like you're how do you feel that more time on music and also more evolution in the just just in the creation process and in the organization process of that how do you feel it's impacting two things one your for overall happiness level and to your creativity in the rest of just life and business and things that you're doing.
00:12:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I think the more that I haven't been able to do this, the more that I can integrate, like I was making the music, so now I know how to make it and release it, so I can just, I just need to get in the rhythm of that right, so I'm gonna take this, I mean this is my plan, the song that I just put the keyboard part on and did the drums on, like okay this is done, this is the arrangement, these are the parts, now I need to go re-record all the guitars and the bass and then I need to redo the vocals. I can do that super quick, right, I just gotta, I gotta learn the bass part, I don't know it so I just have to learn it, but I can, I can learn it, I can probably do all that in like two hours, figure it out, punch it in, get it in there. Time it out. It'll be done. And then the guitar parts are easy. Um, there's one guitar part That I there's another guitar part. This is another first. There's this guitar very distinct guitar part that I hear The weird chord. I don't know what chord it is, but I'll know it when I play it. I don't need to figure that out yet because If it's there, it's just gonna make it better. So I'll go rerecord the stuff that's there For sure going on so it's too It's an acoustic and electric in the bass So I could probably do that. I could do the guitars. No problem So I'll do the bass next because the bass and the drums usually the sort of the flow that I picked up working with Sean is Figure out the arrangement Do the real drums do the real bass Do the real acoustic if there is one do the real electrics if there is one And then you can do some of the jewelry, right? So like the piano part It's like the jewelry that's done, so and then then it's like this is the mistake I think I made the first time we're on with the first song is then you sing the vocals I sang the vocals Early like not to the not to the finish track I think it does make a difference because you're not you're not really singing in the in the context of The song you're singing to the song, but you're not singing to The guitar we know what I mean. It's like that guitar parts gonna get replaced Yes, it's the same, but it isn't because you're never gonna play it exactly the same It's not gonna sound exactly as the same as what's on what ultimately ends up on the track, so I Didn't realize it when he sent it to me before but that was his thing is like sing Wait till it's all done and then sing on it because you're gonna be singing on this very great sounding thing Rather than just singing to the acoustic that you lay down in 20 minutes, which So, I'm going to follow the process truly this time because I need that song to be done to release it and then I can really start to use the fan flowy stuff like I can go play with the fan flowy stuff in the context of, hey, I'm promoting this artist, right? Yeah, it's me, but now I can sort of bring both sides of me to the table and go, oh, well, here I am making this music, but then here I am marketing it and figuring out how to make fan flowy work better, which I can't really do right now because, you know, Sean's band, like, we change the website and then they change it back.
00:15:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, you know, it's me.
00:15:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't have to talk to anyone to say, hey, I want to do this with what? Like, okay, let me turn to myself and look in the mirror, like, Stuart's morning. So I'm waiting for the phone number to get approved, which I submitted on like Tuesday for some reason that one's I can get my own phone number approved Johnny gets people prove left and ran like what am I doing wrong here like I feel like I'm in high level capitalization and everything of company numbers and things like that. It's so dumb. It's so dumb. My was getting turned on because the privacy policy wasn't visible, which whatever I fixed it, it was some weird issue. But so when that's done, then I can go because this is my argument to mark yesterday and today. So he says, Hey, we can't offer these ads to the. Art is because they're too hard to run my version of it is how do we make it so that we can offer to the artist because it's not like It's not like we're asking them to solve a Rubik's cube here, right? It's like come on And it's like how can I but I need to run it two things. I need to run it make sure it's worthwhile This is a good add add tight doesn't get the result It's it better than the other one Is it good to have in the mint whatever it is whatever you learn from it and then it's like okay now and then how do I? Make this, you know stupid proof or as close as stupid proof as possible Which and i'm like he was telling me the problem and I He's like, oh, well, have to go get the ad ID and then of course, I think Well, I could just have someone make a form that finds the ad ID for them. Yeah Like pace the world here scrape everything in the world and populate into something like Come on. Exactly. Yep. Exactly. was a percent. like, yeah, I could just take it, it'll pull it, it'll populate it into the field that is being used by the other way. Like I can see it. So I was like, right, well, but I need to go run the ads and do it myself so I can see it end to end and obviously these, some of these people like don't want, you know, they don't want to be guinea pigs, which I understand.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What did Mark say when you approached it that way?
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I didn't tell that. No, no, no need.
00:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he got that going to argue with you.
00:18:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm just going to do it. Right. I'm like, I'll go figure it out.
00:18:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't need you to sit down on the table with me and do this puzzle.
00:18:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do the puzzle stuff. Yeah. I could be wrong. It's like, okay.
00:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's always interesting to me how your responses come. because that did in no way really answer the question that I asked you but it was useful and good information. The question was how do you feel that working on music in this way, this systematic, know, spending more time on it consistently and being systematic about it has done these two things. And well, I guess that does kind of, you answered by showing me rather than telling me, I guess, but it still music really. When I was asking this, do you feel like it's me? Do you, any happier, like, has it impacted your mood? That's one question.
00:19:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So let's just stick with that part. No, no. don't have bad moods.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like it's me? Wait, I'm, hold on a minute. Oh, no, I turned my volume down or something or hit me the button. Sorry. Did you say something? I don't have bad moods. Well, that's still like, but there's degrees, right?
00:20:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have volumes. Well, what I would say is that what's interesting about it is it's bringing these two worlds are coming together, right? It's like there's never been a time where there's like I said weeks, months ago, right?
00:20:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How like I can just get completely lost doing this.
00:20:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so to me, I mean, that you could call that being happy, right? You could call that like certainly content content, content, where like I can just sit down and get lost, and like I can get lost in a spreadsheet and like solving that puzzle, right? And what's happening is like these two worlds are coming together, like, and that's never, that's never happened before.
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it probably would never would have.
00:20:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's like I Also, what a coincidence that fan flow is like my idea, right? So it's like, oh, look, here's this, this music thing was my idea. The fan flow of things, my idea, I, I'm, I'm working, but it's cool, cool things with cool people. Okay. This is interesting. And it just makes me want to not do other things. Like, I just don't want to work. I was helping someone out with the, the paintless dent repair thing. So I started running ads for that. And the dude that owns that company, like, I guess he didn't know it was me. And he sends this message on this message on Facebook. And I was like, okay, well, doesn't know me. And it's me.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I respond back and I'm like, hey, dude, it's me. And he's like, oh, sorry. And he's like, I can't wait to talk to you and blah, blah, blah.
00:21:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, all right. So I told him I was going to talk to him yesterday, but I forgot.
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought it was Wednesday and I don't do calls on Wednesday.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So I didn't call him yesterday, but so I don't know if it's because. How they didn't call him or whatever he sends this message to me and it's like He's telling me I need you to take that add down It looks bad and it's it's easily cost me a hundred thousand dollars of business. I'm like, okay, hey How the could you possibly know that Be one red flag. Bye-bye Your buddies whack about and he's like, what do you mean you're out? I'm like, I'm out He you trip my one red flag like I'm not but I have time for this . Mm-hmm. I've got more than enough better things to do And I want to do the things that I want to do right same thing with wolf or all the wolf or I'm like I still want to see what happens with the sales page, but The more I look at that. like, yeah, this is just a nice little business, right? okay a six hundred bucks a month pump, call it a day. But I think their business is kind of slightly but then again, I'm like, I don't really care. Look, like, I want to spend time doing that. Although I was chatting with Heather earlier, and she put together a deal to sell some leads, like, all right. And they got it. I go, okay, great, these people seem to get it and they're willing to do whatever it takes to get it to work out. So it's, it's like, okay, we can work on that because that's what we want to do. That's the that's where we want to take this. And if the course thing catches up, I think that's all going to be contingent upon the sales base of Maria and I did, like, it's either going to work or it's not.
00:23:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, she had it will hopefully be next week. She had an offer that was like right up my freaking alley. So I got it from her.
00:23:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like $2,000 and she's really good at marketing.
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she is she really is good at it. She gets psychology. And the offer, I should show it to you, but she basically wrote it down.
00:24:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got all her stuff.
00:24:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like, this is how much I'll take whatever I'm like, well, you don't have to tell me how long it takes because I sit there and I'm just like, my brain gets pulled away from it because I can get pulled away from it. And I don't have anybody to riff off of like that is my biggest issue, no one to riff off of in real time. Whereas everything else that I do for other people, that's all it is, like it's constant riveting, right? So I'm like, you just you put the perfect offer in front of me. It's a no brainer. Here's my 2000. Let's go.
00:24:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's a I think that's a really that's the vibe I got over was like, Oh, I can actually wish with her. Yeah, you're the reason that was possible to even begin with. Yeah, whereas there's very few people I can riff was unmarketing stuff. Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to, I'm going to hire again to work on the whole fan blowing mom thing. I just got to get all these pieces in place, right? So I got, I got the payment gateways approved, I sent it to the guys in France, they're looking at it, so they're going to come back with an answer and then I'm going to, they're going to do it. I just know, you know, I'm like, I know they're going to, I know they're going to take the offer that I just know it and it's going to be this thing and the Spotify guys just sent back their code. I sent that just like that's why I was three minutes late. I sent that to Mark. I was like, you use this because I know how it works. So I need you to use it because you don't. And if you ask, I'll be able to your questions, most likely, but I won't, I won't see a problem because I know how it works. So, but it's done. They freaking did. in less than a week. No, exactly week. They did it in seven days. They actually did that.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't believe it. I couldn't believe it. That's why.
00:26:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just realized that today's day seven actually wasn't supposed to be due till tomorrow, technically.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, so who did they get started?
00:26:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
These dudes. So it's these guys that I found. So we need it. They're called J.D.

Now I've got access to these guys that can just make a reality. And they just sent me the login. It's like, we crap, they did it in a week. Yeah, wild.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I mean, so you know, some people can start off hot and then they kind of, know, what's the word that fizzle out? Yeah. But, um, that's the thing.
00:31:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't even think they're hot. I mean, I don't think it was that part of a job. Just like the one that I had the other guys do, it was not a difficult job. This one was not a difficult job. The other guys took weeks, weeks, and it was a constantly me going back going, no. Like what they would turn in, like, do you guys, do you even try to use this? But this dude, like the UI, he came up, like, what the heck, this dude, this dude gets it. Like it's borderline noreal, like without the depression and dead animals. Oh my gosh, that was a not nice joke, he's not on the phone, I can make that joke. Yeah, so I'm like, so bad about bad jokes this week with Mark and Aaron. About bad animal jokes, I know. But you know, all that morbid comedy aside. Yeah, so I'm like, holy crap, these guys really do it. It's not like I need it on some stuff. I just need that. Like, I just need, and there's clearly more than one of them, so it's not like a dude, it's a team. And I'm like, Okay, and then I mean that was the same the other universe thing was the super rise guys same thing I'm like, what is this built on there like larval like yes Okay, I'm gonna talk to you more right I tried other softwares and when those guys responded with that That's when I was like I'll buy this off you. Let's do a deal like I want to work with you You know and granted it's related to noria, it also isn't like yeah, I'd like to keep noria around and it's like okay But now you've got Those deserts are larval noria's larval the French French guys are larval. Okay, and larval's like we Noria's got some other devs that do it. Okay, great. So we kind of start hanging out in that neighborhood I think that's a good place rather than having it built here built there Whatever, it's like there's some uniformity to it Yeah Speaking of
00:34:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Eric, just any new thoughts about them this past week?
00:34:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. No, I was like dealing with the, we had like family in town stuff, so I wasn't even like graduated and all that good stuff.
00:34:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, congratulations. And how is Denise doing?
00:34:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She thinks she's not doing poorly, but it's not really really yet. She is, I can tell she's starting to not let me in that thing. I'm catching crap. This is what's so funny is like, I work all day, right? I don't work or we know that, but you know, I'm working. So like Denise is a very structured schedule, right? It's very structured. She gets up super early. Because of menopause really but gets up super early then she like I think now what she does she gets up she like listens to Like religious podcasts or something like that like some We'll just you just cause it Jesus. She listens to Jesus stuff And then she'll like now that they're out and then she would like make them breakfast of some sort like she was always making like Pancakes or whatever like not for them, but just it's there Would come rabbit So it would be like Jesus pancakes Jesus pancakes if she was driving to school she'd run to school If she's not driving to school then she walks the dogs or dog walks the dog and she comes back. She works out takes shower and Then like we'll go Run errands or whatever she'll leave so that's all happening between like 6 a.m. then she'd come back in the afternoon And then they come home from school and then she'll make dinner some sort and then it's like, and then she'll eventually like, you know, end up on the couch, watch TV for like an hour or whatever and then go to bed. But now, it's like, they're never home, right? Evelyn went out yesterday and just was gone all day. Maryle went out yesterday with her friend and she was gone the better part of the day, then came home with the friend and then they went out again. so then Denise hits me with no one wants to hang out with me. And I'm like, well, I don't know that that's what's happening. And she lumps me into that crowd. So what I like when I was programming drums and stayed here till like eight o'clock at night, she was giving me Like, I wasn't home to hang out with her on the couch. And I'm like, you don't hang out with me during the day. Like, you know what I mean? So it's like, man, is this what's going to happen? I'm gonna catch this.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't warn you. It's just... It's a consuming thing. And I have been going through this because I went through losing two of the girls. So it's about It isn't about what's left.
00:37:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's about what's gone. Yes. And that's all thing.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Adele is not gone yet, but she's gonna be No, but they are when they start with their friends more and they they're gone. Like it doesn't have to be moved It's just they're not present as much anymore and they don't need or want as much anymore. Then it's gone So it's not about what's still there.
00:37:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's about what's missing and that missing Lloyd and it's difficult and Yeah That's what she keeps saying that I want a dog which is not true Like I could do or not do with the dog I've got the dog because I'm like that will give her something It will not enough something, something extra, right? So to your point, it has to be people.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs more people.
00:38:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's something gone, but there's no, she doesn't, she doesn't like people. No, I invited her, she doesn't.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will leave you, but I'm just saying like, but that's what's missing. It's a people thing.
00:38:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a mom thing. It's a momming people thing. Yeah, yeah. There's no way to replace that. There's no way to, that's a unique thing. Like I invited her to go out, like I go to trivia with Stacy and her not husband, like every two weeks and I used to go here and there, but I've been going a little bit more consistently last couple months because it's fun and like, I need to hang out with people, right? Like I need to go do that. And so I invited her and she literally is like, I want your pity invite. It's right. I'm like, hey, it's not a pity invite. But that's the thing, I was thinking the other day, she's not, to your point, think, she's not been nice to me. She says stuff and luckily I purposefully don't let it get to me, but I'm like, oh my god, you're saying it's pity and bite, I don't hang out with you, if I said these things to you, you would be like all over me, but I'm like, okay. Then like, I was like working in the yard, so she wanted like plants and stuff in the yard, so the week and I'm like, you know what, I'll just do it, like she's banging out really quick, right? I already go out and like take care of the plants, which apparently she was unaware of. So the next day, like I had her go to, I went to Home Depot and bought bunch of plants and then I was like, hey, you come and like, right, let's hang out, you come and we'll pick out some plants. And so we did that although she didn't want to do it. I'm like, oh my God, this is so you're just complaining. OK, got it. So we get the plants and then I go plant them all and like make this nice little area in the area that she hangs up in. And then the next day she goes, how are you doing so much gardening this weekend? go, what are you talking about? I'm like, I do it every weekend. He's like, you do? like, did you not? How do you think these things stay alive? I go, I water them every weekend. was like, oh, I didn't know that. I'm like, oh, she's really killing me.
00:40:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a major transition. statistically, it's very hard on marriages. just apply Dan, brain and puzzling to it. And because it's really hard.
00:40:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure good.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good luck with that.
00:41:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:41:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah. And that's what, but I've been preparing for this since the girls were young because I heard people. I really heard them when they said it. I'm like, I have got, but, but nobody told me it happened before they leave. Like they're gone before they're gone. And with four of them, like, so I've been in this stage of because the first one left in 2018. So, you know, that was six years ago. And, but she started as soon as she got her car. So that was eight years ago. So I've been in a process of losing my children for eight years.
00:41:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's hard to spell.
00:41:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll tell you that. It's just hard. Even when you're not like, well, it was my identity, but I was purposely. trying to not make it my identity, but it still was. So like, but I've always had business and, uh, it's like, you know, I'm mom and business kind of too. Like, so it gives me an outlet for it. So I have that. So I don't even know, like, I would probably lose my mind if it was nothing, no people to take care of at home most of the time. Anyway, yeah, don't know how you can find her people to take care of, but that that might be a puzzle for you to stop.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
People have fur. No, no, because they can't talk. If this dog doesn't work, I'll get a cat. It doesn't matter. She talks to them anyway.
00:42:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She talks to the dogs. She did try.
00:42:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She did try. You did try to go into like a whole thing. Like I can, the whole Jesus thing, whatever, that's all new. So that's sort of the thing. that she's not it's not totally new but like that she's more there's a more concerted sort of i won't even say movement but just that just that like her doing that and i don't know if that's her like pheripizing herself to a degree maybe i'm not sure but then she wanted to do like i'm gonna say the bible study but it wasn't but it's like some sort of group whatever but it's like 45 minutes north they're here and she's like i'm not doing it it would either so she is sort of looking for the more men women have something called release society it's just like one of the oldest female things but just finding jeez because uh so many people go through that well what am i here for right if it's not this anyway but if she's exploring she could check that out i'm a convert i didn't i didn't
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
grow up in the church, but it has been a super happy thing for me. A female connection, but also just the whole family thing was huge. I don't know what it's like in San Diego. That's the other thing, just like most places, most organizations, the location changes what it's like. Like, Utah Mormons are kind of different.
00:44:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They can be very clicky. all of them, obviously, but there's a whole.
00:44:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can go in some areas where people in the church are just rude and judgy in other places where they're really open and welcoming. so like, it's not an end all be all, but if she's an exploring thing, of the communities where they have a strong community could be helpful because women will just like wrap you up and you got to find them first. So then it's a matter of what's the odds for the best way to find something. But anyway, hopefully she finds it. I found Jesus to be very helpful myself. love my Jesus podcast. I'm send some good healing vibes for both of your sakes and get all of the attention and the scrutiny. All the mothering energy put onto you.
00:45:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be that rough. Dexter would go nuts if he had to be here. Well, that happened probably. I don't know. He's really good though. Okay. So music, music, music. It's good. It's going to be really interesting to see how this is my favorite thing about getting to do consulting and seeing the different businesses, which you do also, right? in different, you got your hands and different things, different projects. But what you learn from one thing and then go apply it to another. But because your building music from the top down from the bottom up left, right, whatever, you know, kind of looking at all of it, and also it being really competitive, which applies to, it doesn't apply the same to all markets, but you're in one of the most competitive ones, like how do you get eyeballs, how do you get followers, but what's also really unique about music is that people like you because of how you sound, like, well, and how you look, like it's a whole thing versus the promise of riches, you know what I mean, or the promise of solving a problem. It's just your vibe that that people are drawn to so what I see as a as an interesting aside that you can glean is that the apology of how attraction happens, right? How we're attracted to the artists that we're attracted to, and it would be them showing up as themselves, but also in a systematic approach. Like, how crazy would that be in terms of coaches and consultants and you've got bases or even podcasters who are constantly trying to compete in the noise, whereas if they would just embrace what's unique about them as and think of themselves as entertainers more than marketers or entertainers more than marketers. You know, because like a musician is like, they want to make the music they want to make, right? And so they want the people who like their music. I just feel like there will be more understanding about how to get people to market themselves as them. themselves which reduces friction but it also should reduce competition because people are naturally tend to be you know more unique than I don't know like it's hard to to put it all into into specifics because I guess not everybody's unique some people just have not a whole lot to them but if they're bolder not to want to go market and spend stuff then there's there's usually something kind of a powerful attraction attractant that they have inside of them that has drawn people to them that made them want to do all of that in the first place but anyway I just I think that as you're going through this the things that you noticed and the way that you can apply it to other things that you may have zero interest in moving forward but um yeah anyway it's just going to be interesting to see how working in the music systematically the way that you are is going into effects, all the other things, also adding in the whole, you're almost an empty nest or two. That's all going to be interesting. The audience. Yeah.

then, and then I'm like, well, that thing, like, I think that's I said to her, she would, she said something about, you know, doing the music stuff. And I was like, that I'm executing my plan. Like, that's what I plan on doing. Like, you need to find something to do. Like, that's what I'm going to do. And she didn't realize that, which is fine. It makes sense. But because I'm thinking three years down the road, right? Like is in my head. And of course, we know how my world works in three years, another 71 will be sold, because that's what's going to happen. Right. So I'm operating from that sort of perspective. And also, it's like in three years, it's like, it's also funny, she thinks Italy trips, she's like, it was the trip of a lifetime. I'm like, no, it wasn't. It was a trip. There will be more, because if you think I'm sitting around for like 20 years after I sell this thing, you're dead now. but the girls are there. You're Italian citizenship. Yeah, that will come on these other ones too though, that's the whole thing. So it's like, but no, she, oh yeah, absolutely. She literally just thinks it'll never happen again, which is, I mean, that's all well and good, but I mean, I don't, I mean, this is also the person that, you know, for years and years and years didn't, when I told you this, like I'd get money and she'd be like, is that ours? like, oh, I think it is. So , like she has no idea how much money. we have, which I actually think is a bad thing. I like, you should probably know this, but whatever, it's in your name, you'll be fine.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, sorry. I think that you will figure it out. And just fun, like maybe she just needs to have more fun, but I don't know how you do that. Like you have, we all do it different ways, like if she doesn't like socializing with people, but did with the girls.
00:51:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You would like to go places is what I think she would like.
00:51:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, then we got to figure out how you get some scheduled time and make that happen, but you've built the business so that it can do that very easily.
00:51:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's like paired this stuff down. It's like, okay, here we go.
00:51:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, your meetings are super streamlined and the, you know, yeah, yeah, everything is built to do that. So, okay, so the last, and I know we're coming up on the hour, but. So we're working on the org chart and just kind of thinking about where stuff will be going towards the end of the year. I would like to wait what's happening next week next week. I'll be out of town, but I'm still doing my, my regular calls. Just kind of thinking about. The targets for the end of the year. So, okay, so we know that we're working on another 71 trying to get that 1% of that was some of the questions I had. Oh, hold on. Okay, did you review Marcia's analytics course.
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, I barely worked last week. All right. Okay, so let me do this real quick, Dan.
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is they see. I think that's it out. I think that's how I spell it. Yeah. Okay, so because we just need to know that better. Hold on. me go back to my notes. That was a thing. The funnel kick guy. There is to resolve the data issues and get accurate data populating in Google Analytics. Was there any movement on that?
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's still not working. So I got to hit them up, but it didn't do whatever I thought it was going to do, actually what it should do. I got to send them some screenshots.
00:54:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me change my notes a little bit. All right. Oh, do you need a reminder for that?
00:54:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I was going to ask. No. That's the longest running task we've ever had. Bobby touches it every Monday and every Monday, I'm like, no, that can go.
00:54:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, and then with the Google Analytics, it's determined. governing the extent of customer confusion about Ninja being a supplement versus full course and just saying what we can do to improve that, but we really need to get good data and analytics on there. You were talking about, who was it? It was wicked? Was getting better?
00:55:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
who like segmentaries.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Segmentrix, that's right.
00:55:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You'll.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This in here. Segmentrix work on that. Is there anything that you can be doing now to with segmentrix like just looking into that to see about? Okay, so what I guess what I'm asking is that contingent upon you going through Google Analytics training and Mercer first?
00:55:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, not at all. just have to I just have to find the source of truth. Right. could be. Segmentrix. I'm hoping it's segmentrix.
00:56:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, you gotta look for it. And so do you need a reminder to look into that with segmentrix?
00:56:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:56:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, he sent it. I watched. Yeah, I think I watched it. He sent a video and I watched the whole thing. Like, all right. It sounds interesting, but ultimately I just don't mean that they're so clicking.
00:56:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, all right. Well, just really because it was so much family stuff last week and what we're doing is more of this review. There's kind of, we're in that flux state, again, everything.
00:56:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's summer.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're doing the summer transition. Yes, but. in that it's more about making sure that those those things that we are looking at there like building blocks type things that make sure that when you know everything starts picking up that it's picking up on the right foot and wear it out to be so like for me I'm thinking making sure that we've got that clean data that we understand stuff so we you get that one percent of market share so you can get that maximum selling rate for another 71 so you've got more time for music and enjoy music but also music be profitable because that's also more fun and yeah just kind of that and then whatever else that is on your plate that maybe you don't want on your plate whatever else we can kind of clean up and just be like all right that's going on the dance life that's going on the dance life and dance life is even more awesome now you know Yeah, kind of thing.
