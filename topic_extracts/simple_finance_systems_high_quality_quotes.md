## Quote 1

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. üíô -end post- I‚Äôm Tina Marie, and I‚Äôm a business consultant that has helped several startups grow to million dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. To tell you how I got here, I‚Äôd have to go back a good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80 (think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route and made a good $65 a month. From that point on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made it happen. I worked in fields picking crops with migrant workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16 year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had decided I wanted to go into law. I managed to get a full ride to college and then quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when I realized I couldn‚Äôt stand the agendas and propoganda that came with the education. Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and started working in a call center that housed tech giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the ranks to account management during my 6 years there. I learned that I have a knack for improving any environment I worked in via optimization. My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even realized the power of what I had created. After the birth of daughters, I decided to figure out how to replace my full time income from home. While I went down the ‚ÄúSQUIRREL!!!‚Äù path that most entrepreneurs find themselves on, realized I could take my existing skills and find a home for them online. I‚Äôve been growing companies as a secret weapon on the inside ever since... all while having the time to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in sports and do the things that matter most to me. And now... 16 years after starting online and 17 years after my first child, I‚Äôm sharing my systems with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am. Working smarter and not harder is not cliche... It‚Äôs an anthem to live by. Follow me, and I‚Äôll show you :) 1. Math is Your Friend 2. Start with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 3. Mindset 3.1 You Actually Are Expert Enough 3.2 Being Broke Helps No One 3.3 Why You and Not Some Other Expert 4. Pricing and Packaging 4.1 10% Rule of Thumb 4.2 Lead With Value 4.3 Map a Value Ladder 4.4 Don‚Äôt Overthink It 4.5 Your Core Offer 4.6 Upsells 5. Example Scenarios 5.1 Scenario One ‚ÄìLowballed 5.2 Scenario Two - Bump the Core Offer 5.3 Scenario Three - Bump in Price + Conversion 5.4 Scenario Four - Vip Pricing 5.5 Scenario Five - Double the Upsell Price 5.6 Scenario Six - Tripped Up 5.7 Scenarios Seven - Lower Upsell Price 5.8 Scenario Eight - Lower Core Offer Price 5.9 Scenarios Nine - More Please 5.10 Scenario Ten - High Roller 6. Bottom Line Table of Contents Math Is Your Friend. Chapter 1 Most entrepreneurs do not go into business because they love crunching numbers and balancing the books. It is impossible to tell someone you are not speaking to personally exactly how they should price and package their offers. This is my solution to that problem. I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios with different types of products and packages that you can plug into that should help you see what you can change to get more profits out of your business, with very little additional work other than creating the offers and writing them up. Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals. There is a reason for that... Start With ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù? Chapter 2 Why is it so hard to charge the right price? If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have value. If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they can... you have verifiable value. When YOU are your product, how you value yourself has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle. Here are some things you need to consider in your mind when you figure out your value to your clients: Could they do will do for them, or as well or as fast as you could? Mindset. Chapter 3 You Actually Are Expert Enough. Chapter 3: Part 1 Most unpaid experts don‚Äôt yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you‚Äôre okay with that, right? Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it. Well... when you‚Äôre giving value to a complete stranger who you are only interacting with through websites, text, videos and other marketing materials... even socially on the interwebs... Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn‚Äôt really going to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don‚Äôt charge properly you will end up broke. If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value Look, let‚Äôs say your neighbor wants you to come help him on the computer because he‚Äôs a technoob and well, you‚Äôre awesome. But, because he‚Äôs your friend and lives next door... he doesn‚Äôt offer money, he offers to send you over some of his killer BBQ when he grills this weekend. Being Broke Helps No One. Chapter 3: Part 2 You are not going to be around to help anyone because you‚Äôre broke and depressed. But the economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET. You know... the ones who don‚Äôt want to do business with that douchebag Steve who may be as good or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn‚Äôt worth the investment. Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT. So stop arguing with me and with yourself and listen up. Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it‚Äôs the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace. I don‚Äôt want this to go to your head or anything... Why You and Not Some Other Expert? Chapter 3: Part 3 There are a ton of reasons why people will want to pay you and not someone else. I don‚Äôt want to spend a long time on this so just think about how you‚Äôve chosen one person over another simply on feeling instead of value. If you show up and do the work, you can find a way to get a piece of the market. That‚Äôs my pep talk. If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love. (Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE) Pricing and Packaging. Chapter 4 Remember, I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre offering or how good you are. If you feel like you‚Äôre not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them. Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb to follow. If you‚Äôre offering one on one consulting time or ... 10% Rule of Thumb. Chapter 4: Part 1 Take the highest price you‚Äôre comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price. Let‚Äôs talk about the different types of products and services you might offer. This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services. Any physical products could be added in as well... just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly. Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions. DON‚ÄôT BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay. *note ‚Äì correct pricing and packaging for value isn‚Äôt going to be enough if you don‚Äôt know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard for you, study the book called ‚ÄúPitch Anything‚Äù and work on that skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill. Lead With Value. Chapter 4: Part 2 First of all, I‚Äôm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money. I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads. Do the same thing for your market. You‚Äôre reading my ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù version of that right now. I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I‚Äôm worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest. If I can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôll probably not convince you I‚Äôm worth your time anyway and that‚Äôs just not a foundation I can build on. So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do. Map a Value Ladder. Chapter 4: Part 3 The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire. You can have many different entry points into your marketing ‚Äúeco system‚Äù... it does not have to be simply linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, ‚ÄúFastest Path to Cash‚Äù let‚Äôs consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards. Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is between $6-$20. There‚Äôs so many ways you can validate that is worth more than dinner for two. It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When you look at that and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a no brainer‚Äù... You‚Äôve got a winner. Don‚Äôt Overthink It. Chapter 4: Part 4 Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It‚Äôs going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven‚Äôt seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money. So focus on this part! Pretend it‚Äôs your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this. You would tell them: ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price. Your Core Offer. Chapter 4: Part 5 The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size. My preference is that this is scaleable, so it‚Äôs a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point. Upsells. Chapter 4: Part 6 Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you‚Äôve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want. Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it. I‚Äôll use one of my own value ladders as an example: It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market. Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It‚Äôs harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who‚Äôs focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more. TripWire Offer ‚Äì Projects in a Box Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the ‚Äúorganizationally challenged‚Äù get organized fast. $17 per template Core Offer ‚Äì My Freedom Systems - $97 Four modules in a membership site teaching people Time management, Upsell 1 ‚Äì Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free) I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that‚Äôs recorded for all members of the group. Free Optin/Lead Magnet ‚Äì 10 Ways to $10k Upsell 2 ‚Äì Business Consultation Call $299 90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what‚Äôs next in the business to increase cash and freedom. RARE UPSELL ‚Äì I offer this to less than 1% of my audience Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I‚Äôll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month. It‚Äôs not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment. Applying this to your offer. Think hard and DON‚ÄôT undervalue yourself. Okay... Here‚Äôs the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you. Did I just hear you say ‚ÄúFinally!!!!‚Äù??? I better not have! I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales. Without context, the numbers don‚Äôt mean anything. If you got to this point and skipped the rest above... Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and read it. The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through. Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers. Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them. Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage? Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is it worth? Example Scenarios. Chapter 5 Scenario One: Lowballed. Chapter 5: Part 1 Lowballed. When you‚Äôre too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes? Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $5 750 $3,750 Core Offer $20 150 $3,000 Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350 Total Revenue $10,100 Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer. Chapter 5: Part 2 Bump the Core Offer. Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it‚Äôs still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. Here‚Äôs the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS ‚Äúyes‚Äôs‚Äù to get to $10k a month. When you think about what‚Äôs harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúyes‚Äù that‚Äôs scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $10 500 $5,000 Core Offer $27 100 $2,700 Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345 Total Revenue $10,045 Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion. Chapter 5: Part 3 Bump in Price + Conversion. Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes. As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 475 $5,700 Core Offer $37 75 $2,775 Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675 Total Revenue $10,150 Scenario Four: Vip Pricing. Chapter 5: Part 4 Vip Pricing. This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN‚ÄôT IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 450 $5,400 Core Offer $37 45 $1,665 Upsell 1 $97 10 $970 Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994 Total Revenue $10,029 Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 5 Double the Upsell Price. Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 300 $3,600 Core Offer $37 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,232 Scenario Six: Tripped Up. Chapter 5: Part 6 Tripped Up. Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 275 $5,500 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 5 $985 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,162 Scenario Seven: Lower Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 7 Lower Upsell Price. Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,353 Scenario Eight: Lower Core Offer Price. Chapter 5: Part 8 Lower Core Offer Price. Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $47 45 $2,115 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,082 Scenario Nine: More Please. Chapter 5: Part 9 More Please. Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn‚Äôt that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $14,317 Scenario Ten: High Roller. Chapter 5: Part 10 High Roller. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference. Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $16,317 Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales. In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market. If you‚Äôve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more. Bottom Line.

## Quote 2

> we just had the meeting yesterday to determine what is the big rock we're up selling this to eventually and we'd agree to be more of the CM pocket CMOCO offer and then also I think it was also like a maybe a group watching thing maybe or is it more just the but anyway so when I know what the end result is then when I record videos and stuff I can indoctrinate them into that other offer right so here's what I think you should I think everybody should keep this in mind all the time if you're going to be in any kind of coaching I think you should have top middle bottom tiers and the and there's multiple reasons for that but I'm going to touch on them super fast sure top tier higher money higher effective hourly rate but also higher level energy coming back from your clients when you work with high level people they teach you as much as you teach them you learn from them it's also higher energy and just higher value so it kind it it financially energy basically and intellectually fuels everything else that you do, the high level tier, okay? But you can only do a little bit of it. It also takes a lot of you energetically and intellectually, okay? The mid-level tier is to me, so we're talking about the 10% that not going to do a lot, the 10%, they're going to succeed no matter what you do, and then there's that 80%. And this is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most that are most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing, and we're gauging that by the things that we've set out. to attract them as well as the things that we've set up to filter out those who don't match this particular group set really well. So but they also give a significant enough amount of money that they that we're earning from them and they help fuel you know our lives and what we're doing in our business but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching right so we're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest pool of it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping what we need to do to improve what we're doing. Then the lower tier is kind of our give back but it's also the most scalable it's the most hands-off so it doesn't cost a lot anybody that wants it can probably afford it. by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week, if they can't, you know, if they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of this, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does don't give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do. So, anyone coaching and teaching should have all of these tiers for all of the reasons that I just said, they need the center group for the feedback loop and to make the impact, because anybody who's coaching wants to make an impact. That is part of what made them go into it in the first place. The high level group is needed because of what I said, because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. Um, you also want to have high level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high level connection. So that's important. And then the lower level thing, again, is just the super scalable, um, low, low impact. And if it continues to do well, that's also a market signal saying that this market still exists. Um, it continues to deal with lot of impact. So a lot of touching on it and everything that you do feeds each other. So everything that you do to serve your high level clients should, should come down. So you create, um, the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points. Three levels of earning power three levels of energy, you know what I mean, um, so it can be That you have those three levels for YouTube, but I wouldn't do that because The to be a high level YouTube creator and coach almost really feels like you've got a high level in video production and Yeah, in their minds probably yeah, and that seems like a lot of work Because there's a lot of skill involved. We're talking about huge processing power Yeah, time suck. So having a top middle and lower class for YouTube itself does not seem like a great idea as YouTube as a channel inside of marketing inside of a marketing Operation business hybrid makes much more sense to me as you are such a generalist and I am as well even even in my systems operations that if we're going to have an and you can't the bandwidth required to do more than one high-middle low level type of offering as a coaching consultant would take too much more than I would be willing to give more than you would probably be willing to get so to me that is the offer it's business sustainable um business growth um profits however you want to call it through a marketing systems and operations right and obviously it needs a sexier name but but that's it and so hopefully that gives you some clarity does yeah yeah so yeah um one of the things I'm going to do is put in um to uh

## Quote 3

> Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.

## Quote 4

> Yeah, me stop. I'm sure what I got I walked through and maybe we make an amalgamation of stuff But I walk people through today like a customer journey map, right? Like and actually was giving examples one was even yours PTM Maximizer and say you offered a six and six score of six figures six months. Okay, whatever free school please example and I share with them my you know journey map here, but then it goes into a Like this is rated live on the call with one of the people today So then it goes into a value ladder like this kind of a high-ticket ascension thing from low ticket So yeah, so her case it wasn't free. This is this was your micro offer So basically, where's your micro offers? hers was Facebook ads for financial advisors, let's say it's 1440, and then what's your order bump? 27, it doesn't have to be in order but this could just be upsell or whatever. So maybe that's better if I just say upsell, upsell one. And then I'll just, just for the remedy, I'll just take up 100 deals, pack of the safe proven, Facebook and IG proven templates. And then I asked her what does she want next, her lifestyle? Cause she does have a hot done for you stuff, like, but she said, I'd like to select her 1000 of course, that's more passive. So yeah, let's create the 100K scale fast systems on nine seven. So then it fills all this, populates this out, right? So did you build this? Yeah. Nice. So yeah, and also I have a whole ad challenge calculator, all that stuff too. then here if we work backwards so let's work backwards how much do we really want to make and she said she wants to make 15 grand a month so okay so we weren't just played to the numbers everything in blue is what you change so well let's say um you want seven sales of a thousand and and that's almost 7,000 here right let's just for easier number let's change just a thousand so i'm a graphical person right so i like seeing graphically what it is uh oops i love that so step 300k skills this is so so say we got seven sales that's seven grand and then okay well how what's the agreement going to be of the people that bought up cell one um it could be of people who just bought the micro carbon can skip step two but i like to have it up so on yeah so so this is five percent so so so in order to make 7,000 here we need 140 people here right the five percent and then that's um you know total revenue here would be 380 because the Facebook and IG templates was 27. could always change that price point and that changes this too. And it's like, okay, what's the conversion rate, people for $27, people who bought the $14, you know, Facebook ads for financial buyers, what's the conversion rate needed? An order of $1 should convert at 30 to 50% or else you're bad, you know, and an upsell should convert at about 30%, especially since it's only $27. So, 40% is very, very conservative. That's going to bring in this money and then how many, you know, sales of this micro-off you need 350 sales. So, that's a 10% conversion rate because it's only $14. Again, this could change drastically if it's like 3%. So, that's for $15,000. So, how many page visits do you need? $3,500. I have a whole ad calculator. Basically, if you're paying, say, this could be all organic, first of all, or joint ventures, know, people have your email. I'll give you a 50% commission on the front end or whatever, or it could be, hey, you're paying a dollar or $2 per click, then you can figure out your ad spend as well. So still good. If you're paying $2 per click, $7000 to double your money when it's almost passive. That's cool. So that's what we have. then like when we do it list, so moving is something pretty like this. I did your PT maximizer, say, okay, you have a school. So, so, uh, 100 days to 10k. So no less up that one. Is it here? Yeah. So I was like, okay, your value ladder was you had a school group, and you have a private time energy maximizer, 20 bucks, and then you've got 6,000, you know, 6,000 a third course and that 6,000. So wherever the course name is, right? So, so two sales, you know, that's that's 12 grand, say 5% of the people to buy profit time energy maximizer. buy it. So the thing that's wrong with this is that you could skip this middle one and just have two steps. Like, so 5% of these people, 267 people buy it, right? But anyway, say you have a 15% of your free school community buy your $20 thing, then you only need 267 people in your free school community to produce 12,800 a month, sort of. Anyway, so yeah. Yeah.

> measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?

## Quote 6

> Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.

> It's they're using the same model like there's they make money selling white labels. And then it's up to the white labeler. I think the problem with high level. I actually just went over this with someone the other day. The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill. of you could build an agency. In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real, are the people that build things like this, the litifies of high level, where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real. doesn't matter. Yeah, if you built a couple of custom things, that's going to make it look better. But really, if you want to sell that business, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. the cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for pay management doctors. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at $9.97 a month, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. that's eight acts in your own.

> Right. Okay. then here's another way to look at the math mark. Is there an investment that can be made to make a person like Lorenz better? Does he need, you know, so you're already doing this, right? And so one of the things that I'm really good at is a perspective shift of looking at the data and using it to your advantage, creating systems. like, he had conversations. What do you call them? Reviews, you know, anyway, with his people. And he said, yeah, we do this, you know, about monthly. I'm like, about monthly or monthly. He goes, well, I missed it last month. And then I missed it in February and one of our I'm like, okay, so what are the results of those conversations that you have, like, are you finding out, like, and I didn't want to leave the question. So basically, it was, you know, coaching and feedback and what he could do to improve them. but the result was that there was something important that came out of those conversations every single time I'm like, but you don't schedule them all they make sure that they happen every single month, and he dropped his head and he's like, no, I'm like, well, how can you expect consistent improvement if you don't have a system to ensure consistent improvement. That happens consistently. So it's a really basic thing. But I'm like, I buy next week the next time I talk to you, I want you to have scheduled that and he goes, well, sometimes, you know, people. people's schedules like they don't work and will schedule something and then it can't happen I'm Lorenz you could find another time and he's like because last week someone saw his own vacation I said so your solution is to wait a month and then not have it rather than just reschedule he's like no I'm like but that's that is what it was so I'm like if you are if you really want to be better and instead of feeling bad about your numbers and kind of feeling like a victim about your numbers then you've got to drive and and this is how you do it so anyway I can't see having such an issue like I can't move my zoom window and I can't see what I need to see in a thriving minute anyway so ah no not that yeah t-ness issues don't need to do that um oh so anyway so as I'm digging in with a little bit more so so now I have targets detail pros made that go away so I'm going rock my head around this a little bit more and do some math about what would the improvement be a value to you? So I've never had that before. So we've done this math when it comes to leads, vendor sources, like we look at how much does it cost us to acquire a retainer and what's the average attorney fee was. We had that math and so we've done it in terms of evaluating vendors and states but I haven't done that at the attorney level and so now I can do that working with Patrick and Lorenz and seeing what kind of improvement and optimization we can do that first of all pays the bill for what we're with me and then a second of all becomes profit above and beyond that so what I'm going to be looking for is are there other types of trainings. Can I get a breakdown of what everybody costs? Actually that would be super helpful. Can I get payroll for all of the PODs, individual people, so I can really understand because I'm getting data from the attorneys okay about what are the activities that they're doing so that I can kind of have a cost evaluation of each of the people and the roles and look for those levers a little bit more that way.

Nobody made him do it. It wasn't necessary to do the job, but nobody works with me to just do the job. We work together to do the job optimally and optimize isn't just the most out of the least for the business's sake. It's the most out of the least for the person's sake, meaning the most results out of the least effort and stress and overwhelm. anxiety for the people who are doing the job, and everybody wants that. But most people don't think it's possible. It is 100% possible to be so much better at the job that you do now by a few little tweaks of fortifying systems, scripts, documented processes, and SOPs. There including just leadership, talking to your people, knowing what they need, knowing what drives them, and showing them how they can get what they want, and it's completely within their power, and also showing them how they can avoid the consequences they don't want, like losing a job, and how it's completely in their power. So, if you will figure out how you can track their performance and results. Now, this is not about micromanagement, but it is about the micro data. Okay, you're not going to go tell them. I notice you did you got to fix this little thing better. You're just going to show them the stats like I showed you. I'm not telling you on any kind of minute level how you can improve your your average resolution time. I haven't got a clue. You do that. I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to tell you this is the thing. This is the impact it makes. And here are some of the things you can do to improve your team within that figure out how improving your team gets that step improved. Right.

## Quote 12

> Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.

## Quote 13

> Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?

## Quote 14

> And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.

## Quote 15

> There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.
