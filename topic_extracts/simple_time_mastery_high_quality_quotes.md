## Quote 1

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. üíô -end post- I‚Äôm Tina Marie, and I‚Äôm a business consultant that has helped several startups grow to million dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. To tell you how I got here, I‚Äôd have to go back a good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80 (think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route and made a good $65 a month. From that point on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made it happen. I worked in fields picking crops with migrant workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16 year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had decided I wanted to go into law. I managed to get a full ride to college and then quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when I realized I couldn‚Äôt stand the agendas and propoganda that came with the education. Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and started working in a call center that housed tech giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the ranks to account management during my 6 years there. I learned that I have a knack for improving any environment I worked in via optimization. My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even realized the power of what I had created. After the birth of daughters, I decided to figure out how to replace my full time income from home. While I went down the ‚ÄúSQUIRREL!!!‚Äù path that most entrepreneurs find themselves on, realized I could take my existing skills and find a home for them online. I‚Äôve been growing companies as a secret weapon on the inside ever since... all while having the time to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in sports and do the things that matter most to me. And now... 16 years after starting online and 17 years after my first child, I‚Äôm sharing my systems with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am. Working smarter and not harder is not cliche... It‚Äôs an anthem to live by. Follow me, and I‚Äôll show you :) 1. Math is Your Friend 2. Start with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 3. Mindset 3.1 You Actually Are Expert Enough 3.2 Being Broke Helps No One 3.3 Why You and Not Some Other Expert 4. Pricing and Packaging 4.1 10% Rule of Thumb 4.2 Lead With Value 4.3 Map a Value Ladder 4.4 Don‚Äôt Overthink It 4.5 Your Core Offer 4.6 Upsells 5. Example Scenarios 5.1 Scenario One ‚ÄìLowballed 5.2 Scenario Two - Bump the Core Offer 5.3 Scenario Three - Bump in Price + Conversion 5.4 Scenario Four - Vip Pricing 5.5 Scenario Five - Double the Upsell Price 5.6 Scenario Six - Tripped Up 5.7 Scenarios Seven - Lower Upsell Price 5.8 Scenario Eight - Lower Core Offer Price 5.9 Scenarios Nine - More Please 5.10 Scenario Ten - High Roller 6. Bottom Line Table of Contents Math Is Your Friend. Chapter 1 Most entrepreneurs do not go into business because they love crunching numbers and balancing the books. It is impossible to tell someone you are not speaking to personally exactly how they should price and package their offers. This is my solution to that problem. I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios with different types of products and packages that you can plug into that should help you see what you can change to get more profits out of your business, with very little additional work other than creating the offers and writing them up. Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals. There is a reason for that... Start With ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù? Chapter 2 Why is it so hard to charge the right price? If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have value. If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they can... you have verifiable value. When YOU are your product, how you value yourself has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle. Here are some things you need to consider in your mind when you figure out your value to your clients: Could they do will do for them, or as well or as fast as you could? Mindset. Chapter 3 You Actually Are Expert Enough. Chapter 3: Part 1 Most unpaid experts don‚Äôt yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you‚Äôre okay with that, right? Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it. Well... when you‚Äôre giving value to a complete stranger who you are only interacting with through websites, text, videos and other marketing materials... even socially on the interwebs... Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn‚Äôt really going to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don‚Äôt charge properly you will end up broke. If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value Look, let‚Äôs say your neighbor wants you to come help him on the computer because he‚Äôs a technoob and well, you‚Äôre awesome. But, because he‚Äôs your friend and lives next door... he doesn‚Äôt offer money, he offers to send you over some of his killer BBQ when he grills this weekend. Being Broke Helps No One. Chapter 3: Part 2 You are not going to be around to help anyone because you‚Äôre broke and depressed. But the economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET. You know... the ones who don‚Äôt want to do business with that douchebag Steve who may be as good or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn‚Äôt worth the investment. Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT. So stop arguing with me and with yourself and listen up. Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it‚Äôs the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace. I don‚Äôt want this to go to your head or anything... Why You and Not Some Other Expert? Chapter 3: Part 3 There are a ton of reasons why people will want to pay you and not someone else. I don‚Äôt want to spend a long time on this so just think about how you‚Äôve chosen one person over another simply on feeling instead of value. If you show up and do the work, you can find a way to get a piece of the market. That‚Äôs my pep talk. If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love. (Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE) Pricing and Packaging. Chapter 4 Remember, I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre offering or how good you are. If you feel like you‚Äôre not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them. Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb to follow. If you‚Äôre offering one on one consulting time or ... 10% Rule of Thumb. Chapter 4: Part 1 Take the highest price you‚Äôre comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price. Let‚Äôs talk about the different types of products and services you might offer. This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services. Any physical products could be added in as well... just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly. Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions. DON‚ÄôT BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay. *note ‚Äì correct pricing and packaging for value isn‚Äôt going to be enough if you don‚Äôt know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard for you, study the book called ‚ÄúPitch Anything‚Äù and work on that skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill. Lead With Value. Chapter 4: Part 2 First of all, I‚Äôm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money. I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads. Do the same thing for your market. You‚Äôre reading my ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù version of that right now. I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I‚Äôm worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest. If I can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôll probably not convince you I‚Äôm worth your time anyway and that‚Äôs just not a foundation I can build on. So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do. Map a Value Ladder. Chapter 4: Part 3 The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire. You can have many different entry points into your marketing ‚Äúeco system‚Äù... it does not have to be simply linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, ‚ÄúFastest Path to Cash‚Äù let‚Äôs consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards. Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is between $6-$20. There‚Äôs so many ways you can validate that is worth more than dinner for two. It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When you look at that and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a no brainer‚Äù... You‚Äôve got a winner. Don‚Äôt Overthink It. Chapter 4: Part 4 Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It‚Äôs going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven‚Äôt seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money. So focus on this part! Pretend it‚Äôs your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this. You would tell them: ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price. Your Core Offer. Chapter 4: Part 5 The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size. My preference is that this is scaleable, so it‚Äôs a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point. Upsells. Chapter 4: Part 6 Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you‚Äôve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want. Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it. I‚Äôll use one of my own value ladders as an example: It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market. Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It‚Äôs harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who‚Äôs focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more. TripWire Offer ‚Äì Projects in a Box Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the ‚Äúorganizationally challenged‚Äù get organized fast. $17 per template Core Offer ‚Äì My Freedom Systems - $97 Four modules in a membership site teaching people Time management, Upsell 1 ‚Äì Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free) I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that‚Äôs recorded for all members of the group. Free Optin/Lead Magnet ‚Äì 10 Ways to $10k Upsell 2 ‚Äì Business Consultation Call $299 90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what‚Äôs next in the business to increase cash and freedom. RARE UPSELL ‚Äì I offer this to less than 1% of my audience Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I‚Äôll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month. It‚Äôs not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment. Applying this to your offer. Think hard and DON‚ÄôT undervalue yourself. Okay... Here‚Äôs the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you. Did I just hear you say ‚ÄúFinally!!!!‚Äù??? I better not have! I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales. Without context, the numbers don‚Äôt mean anything. If you got to this point and skipped the rest above... Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and read it. The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through. Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers. Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them. Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage? Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is it worth? Example Scenarios. Chapter 5 Scenario One: Lowballed. Chapter 5: Part 1 Lowballed. When you‚Äôre too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes? Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $5 750 $3,750 Core Offer $20 150 $3,000 Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350 Total Revenue $10,100 Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer. Chapter 5: Part 2 Bump the Core Offer. Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it‚Äôs still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. Here‚Äôs the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS ‚Äúyes‚Äôs‚Äù to get to $10k a month. When you think about what‚Äôs harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúyes‚Äù that‚Äôs scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $10 500 $5,000 Core Offer $27 100 $2,700 Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345 Total Revenue $10,045 Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion. Chapter 5: Part 3 Bump in Price + Conversion. Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes. As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 475 $5,700 Core Offer $37 75 $2,775 Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675 Total Revenue $10,150 Scenario Four: Vip Pricing. Chapter 5: Part 4 Vip Pricing. This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN‚ÄôT IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 450 $5,400 Core Offer $37 45 $1,665 Upsell 1 $97 10 $970 Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994 Total Revenue $10,029 Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 5 Double the Upsell Price. Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 300 $3,600 Core Offer $37 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,232 Scenario Six: Tripped Up. Chapter 5: Part 6 Tripped Up. Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 275 $5,500 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 5 $985 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,162 Scenario Seven: Lower Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 7 Lower Upsell Price. Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,353 Scenario Eight: Lower Core Offer Price. Chapter 5: Part 8 Lower Core Offer Price. Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $47 45 $2,115 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,082 Scenario Nine: More Please. Chapter 5: Part 9 More Please. Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn‚Äôt that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $14,317 Scenario Ten: High Roller. Chapter 5: Part 10 High Roller. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference. Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $16,317 Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales. In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market. If you‚Äôve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more. Bottom Line.

## Quote 2

> Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.

## Quote 3

> and make sure we need to do this and then that that's being done like perfectly and then the other side like the basic stuff starts to like get missed so it's like I don't know if it's something about you know being able to see it in order for them to not forget but it will help it will help a lot so one of the things that I think that whoa actually meeting myself um that we might do and again please frame this with your team and let them know that this is a work in progress that there is this is going to be probably really clunky in the beginning and maybe more of a pain than it seems like it's worth but if they will stick with it we will make a system that works well for everybody and it makes at least some improvement for everybody and from everybody's perspective if we're wrong about that you got a person that probably ought to go because really it should be something that everyone can get benefit from. The only reason that wouldn't be is one if they're just that negative or two, they don't contribute to developing the system. Meaning they've made suggestions, they've explained with some kind of articulate eloquence why something doesn't work, so we can figure out a workaround. But at the end of the day, things are falling through the cracks and not getting done the most efficiently possible. The goal is not perfection, the goal is progress, but progress doesn't continue to come without being intentional about it. You can't just show up and be like, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I do. Progress comes from strategically planning how to improve doing what you do, right? So that's what this is about. So to that point, Patrick, one of the. things that theoretically, because I've not used Slack like this, I have used lots of other project management suites. But I don't want to create a new application that you guys have to log into. So I love the Slack idea, Lauren, by the way, good job. And I love you, Brad, chat to me too. I was like, I just know you got to do that. I'm such a nerdy girl. literally be talking to chat to you in the middle like, okay, how do you write this? How do you figure out this? I had an hour session with my 14 year old daughter trying to plan her career because she's like, what's a good place that they have lots of pets, but not a lot of vets, because she wants to be vet. So we talked to chat TBT and it's like Aurora, Colorado, and then we were off to the races for like an hour. Anyway, hang on, Lauren, real quick. So, Patrick, what we should be able to get is notice a pattern like, like you just said, right? If we start doing this, then this dips off. We start doing this and this dips off. What you'll probably find is that just paying attention to things, so just thinking about how different operations have been for you guys just because you thought about it differently. We had conversations, it stuck in your head, it popped into your head throughout the week, you're like, oh, you know what? I'm going to go do this. That's what will happen with your team too. They're like, there's just something changes as soon as you create awareness. So there's the level of awareness of just, oh yeah, like that's a lot of stuff that has to happen in the case, and it has to happen with every case. And there's kind of like a timeline that has to happen, and then when you add in the fact that you're looking at your cases and Lorenz you're like, or either one of you like, hey, it's been three weeks, nobody's checked in to see and make sure, you know, client didn't die. Everything's okay. We've still got a number. that works. All, you know what I mean? Like, once a week, at least are hearing from us, Hey, we're just checking on you, letting you know where we're at. You know, nothing has really changed, but wanted you to know we're here, we're working for you. That kind of thing. You're doing that. Your whole team needs to do that. So the more visuals we have here, right, the more structure that they're looking at, if they can see the tasks and slack, if they can see the outline of these or all the things that have to happen, instead of trying to keep it in their head every day going, wait, what do we need to do? Like, did somebody leave me the correct notes about what I need to do next? Do I already know what I need to do next instead of sitting there for two or three minutes ago? Oh, yeah. The next thing is, out of those two or three minutes over a week, over each person, over a month, over a year, we're talking tens of hours at the very least that we're saving doing this. And that's on your best day. Sometimes people going to show up with a migraine, you got women sometimes are going be cramping. Sometimes and somebody's gonna be hurting, depressed, whatever, all kinds of things, right? The mental lag time multiplies at times like that. So this mitigates some of just the humanness and the weakness that we have. And but also really helps everyone to see how is the whole case flow doing, even if I'm not the one doing it. And again, if somebody's like all of a sudden, I'm gonna be out for two months. Well, what has Mike been handling? What's been Mike been on top of? like, look at all those mics. I got to give that to somebody else. Holy crap, know, like Lauren's you're going through this stuff right now. So it's a process, you get some insight with the insight comes some improvement. And also with the insight comes more burden to an extent because now you have a new awareness that, oh, we're actually to not doing so great on this. But overall, it creates lifts, it creates traction. And as you've seen, Patrick, now with chat GBT, you'll notice one of the things that we improve a lot is just the mental effort. We're reducing the mental load and leveraging the mental effort. Chat GBT, if we can use Slack, so you're not having to manually remind everybody, chat GBT, helping us strategically plan it. It's not real AI. It's just logic. If this, then not. It's got a database of questions to ask, but for the most part, the output is equivalent to the input. So if we ask it really good questions and logic, it's not going to come up with anything we couldn't have done ourselves most of the time, but it will get there much faster so that we can process the next question, the next step, and so on. And so, anyway. But At the end of it comes, your cases get done faster. More reliably, we should be seeing better incentive pay. also within, so timeline, roughly 90 days. It's going to be a pain in the butt for roughly 90 days. The first 90 days are lots of growing pains. It takes about 90 days to work out and create the first iteration of a sick, the first successful iteration of a project management system with a small team. I'd say 45 to 90 days. Okay, so bear that in mind. Think about whatever is important to your team, especially that this is going to help us a lot when somebody's not available or the team changes or you're just having a rough day and we can't keep track of everything. thing. The goal of this is not micromanagement. The goal of this is not to create more work. So ask them to have a little faith and try to be part of the team making the process better. Okay.

## Quote 4

> He's a doctor, so he's got different types of ways that he provides service and he thought this type of service was the most profitable when really it was this one and he had no clue because he didn't check his numbers because it was a pain in the butt and there wasn't a database and nobody told him how to do it. Nobody made him do it. It wasn't necessary to do the job, but nobody works with me to just do the job. We work together to do the job optimally and optimize isn't just the most out of the least for the business's sake. It's the most out of the least for the person's sake, meaning the most results out of the least effort and stress and overwhelm. anxiety for the people who are doing the job, and everybody wants that. But most people don't think it's possible. It is 100% possible to be so much better at the job that you do now by a few little tweaks of fortifying systems, scripts, documented processes, and SOPs. There including just leadership, talking to your people, knowing what they need, knowing what drives them, and showing them how they can get what they want, and it's completely within their power, and also showing them how they can avoid the consequences they don't want, like losing a job, and how it's completely in their power. So, if you will figure out how you can track their performance and results. Now, this is not about micromanagement, but it is about the micro data. Okay, you're not going to go tell them. I notice you did you got to fix this little thing better. You're just going to show them the stats like I showed you. I'm not telling you on any kind of minute level how you can improve your your average resolution time. I haven't got a clue. You do that. I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to tell you this is the thing. This is the impact it makes. And here are some of the things you can do to improve your team within that figure out how improving your team gets that step improved. Right. So you're going to do the same thing and say these are your goals. These are where you hit your goals. That means something's measurable. Something is measurable. Right. I'm trying to remember because I have your list on.

## Quote 5

> And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.

## Quote 6

> No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.

## Quote 7

> Timeline photos THE POWER OF GOOD QUESTIONS: ============================ Someone asked me where I got my knowledge from. It caught me off guard. He mentioned that I reference ‚Äúa lot of books‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but I only started reading books as an adult about three years ago. And with four kids, I think I‚Äôve had time for about fifteen of them. Really, my knowledge comes more from asking questions. In fact... ----------------------------------- If I had to pick the one biggest ‚Äúpower move‚Äù I‚Äôve had throughout my life, it would be asking good questions. ----------------------------------- There is TREMENDOUS power in moving a person to think specific thoughts. QUESTIONS MAKE PEOPLE THINK SPECIFIC THOUGHTS. Human nature is such that if a question is posed to a person, they will ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER. They may not SHOW interest‚Ä¶ but the question will hit and their minds will wonder, even if momentarily, what the answer is OR they will answer it. --- IN CONFLICT --- I used questions to get out of beatings. I had between the time a hand was drawn back from the time it hit my face to ask a question that made my mom think about what the consequences of hitting me would be, or why she shouldn‚Äôt do it. Like ‚Äúwhat do you expect me to do when my example is ‚Äúabc‚Äù ‚Ä¶ what else could I know?‚Äù The strikes would lose their venom‚Ä¶ and I would get hit with words instead. Word battles I stood a better chance with, at the time. --- IN SCHOOL --- I used questions to get better grades in school. When the teacher wanted to regurgitate a book out to the class and leave us with little other information‚Ä¶ I raised my hand incessantly to ask the same thing from five different angles. I wanted to understand the CONCEPT AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION of everything I learned. Why? ‚áê== question :) Because those sneaky buggers liked to put things on the test that looked nothing like what was in the book. Because I understood the concepts, I was able to solve problems and answer questions well. --- IN CORPORATE --- This was less appreciated here than it was anywhere else. During management meetings in my early twenties, short meetings were often extended because I had a lot of questions. I was not a favorite. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be. I was trying to get a promotion every quarter for six years. But that‚Äôs not really my biggest win. My biggest win was a TEAM win. While, in the beginning, NO ONE appreciated my questions‚Ä¶ in the end, . Here‚Äôs why. I understood our needs better than most. AND‚Ä¶ I understood our RESOURCES better than most. I worked in a tech support call center as a technician then moved up to account manager. We managed top of the line tech firms that everyone here knows very well. COMPETITION WAS BRUTAL. We were constantly being threatened with losing our accounts to the Philippines or Costa Rica. This was a huge employer for my community and probably the only ‚ÄúDesk job‚Äù for the entry level workforce. The threats flowed downhill DAILY. Threats of being terminated. Watching people get fired frequently. Yelling, tension, things that are not legal. Given my history ‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt a fan of threats or not having power. So‚Ä¶ I took all my knowledge acquired from asking my ‚Äúannoying questions‚Äù and created a system that would save us for years, and that the company ended up adopting worldwide. Our biggest problem was not meeting metrics. There were two main factors for that‚Ä¶ Lack of tracking and lack of staffing due to lack of tracking. So, I created an excel workbook that I would export multiple Lucent reports into. I created formulas on each sheet to tabulate the data I needed. At the end of the workbook, I combined that data daily, weekly and monthly averages plus a forecast for the coming week, month, quarter and year. I updated my reports every morning before I got to work. Instead of waiting for clients to ask for our stats, I started sending them to my boss who could send it to the clients. #JobSecurity Knowing the stats in real time and historically made it easy to see our trends and fix them. Back to my goal for the hard work‚Ä¶ I doubled my salary by the time I left, receiving my first promotion within the first two months and many more after that. --- IN HIRING --- Another part of my success was my hiring practice. While the company had an attrition rate of 70%... My attrition rate was 30%, and almost all of those were due to people transferred onto my team that I did not hire‚Ä¶ OR‚Ä¶ to promotions, because I hired quality people. My process only varied from others in one thing‚Ä¶ questions. I asked more of them. I asked technical questions. I asked situational questions. THEN I SHUT UP AND LISTENED. There is a LOT that you CAN NOT ASK in corporate. However‚Ä¶ if you let a person alone with enough awkward silence‚Ä¶ they will often fill that space with talking, and tell you things that you WANT to know but cannot ask. AWKWARD SILENCE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOOLS. I can hang with it all day long if it serves my purpose. Which brings us to‚Ä¶ --- IN SALES --- Questions are so powerful in sales. Questions are how you get a prospect to CLOSE THEMSELVES ON A DEAL. Seriously. If you‚Äôve asked yourself enough of the right questions to identify your ideal prospect and you know you have the solution for them, asking them the right questions will be very effective in helping you close the deal. What kinds of questions, you ask? (Good question!) - You ask them about their biggest pain points. - You ask them how long they have been dealing with it. - You ask them what else is suffering because of that problem. You ask them how they‚Äôve tried to solve it. If they never have‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a good chance they never will, and why would they let that continue when you can solve it for them? If they have tried and failed‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ you know why they failed‚Ä¶ and you can solve it for them. >>> But you don‚Äôt TELL Them that. <<< You ask them if they have tried doing something you would do for them. Then you wait for that tone that says‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ but that sounds like a good idea‚Ä¶ I wonder if‚Ä¶ And then you ask them if they‚Äôve tried something else you would

## Quote 8

> Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.

> And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.

> I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.

> So we could throw in an image like that, too. Let's see if I get the image. So because we have limited time, this is, this helps kind of just give an example. Let me see if I can add an image or maybe I could just drag it in. Let me just complete that particular step in my head. It's not a desktop. There it is. All right. right. Yeah, so what I would like to do, however long it takes, is spend some time, a lot of it I can do myself, and then I could show you, and then on calls we can kind of work through it and go, I'll go like, well, here's what I've come up with. And then discuss it, and as we discussed it, I would imagine because this is what happens is I'll either get inspired to make modifications or you'll have some modifications that you'll suggest. But at the end of the conversation, however long that takes, we will have a template that a person can pick and choose and say, okay, I want this board I don't need this board. This is not applicable, right, but they'll have the master thing. So instead of going and adding boards, they can just remove, remove, remove, being able to visualize the whole thing can help. And so it in and of itself could be its own product and service. The other thing is, though, if we get a high level client, then we go through and say, okay, these are the boards that are applicable. now we just create. eight assignments, like, who's going to do this? When is this going to get done? Who's going to do this? When is it going to done? There will be dependencies that are built into the template. For example, if you're building a sales page, first of all, you have to have a domain. You have to have hosting. You have to have the, you have to have a merchant processing. You have to have, maybe you have to have a gateway if you have a merchant account, know, like all of these things. But then you have to have copy. You have to have images. The images need to be inspired by the copy. So the copy has to come first. So there's a dependency, right? The copywriter has to know what the name of the product is and has to have some information on them. So the copy is dependent upon market research and definition. So all of that stuff can be created in a, not necessarily linear, but somewhat chronological process and for people. I've never done this or never done it well. Most of the people that have done it did not do it well, did not do it quickly. It'll be the first time they've seen it mapped out like that. Even on a high level, because a lot of the high level, and I'm talking about seven and even eight bigger earners, I think it's very different once you get to nine and above. They didn't get there by not systematizing, optimizing, even if they're not good at higher somebody who is good at it. They understand the process because somebody else was helping them in doing it. They did it themselves. But seven and eight figure earners, a lot of the times just got there by grit, determination, charisma, that type of thing. Lots of times. It's not through good business structure, organization, and optimization. Anyway, I would like to do this. So what I was talking about is for us to create an agenda. And the agenda can be we progress on it even if we can't meet because stuff is going happen. Yeah, we can't meet but then we still know what we're working on. So to me and I'm going to go ahead and save this for now and pop over to this one, questions for next meeting, I'm going to say agenda, meeting agendas. I'm going add a card so big rocks call it big rocks so big rocks are not that open card. Really the big rocks so I'm kind of prioritizing them. So the big rock is one, two, four, five, on the through three not two three one two three anyway one three um high level df done for you um clients or done with you either i'll say df y slash the clients um that we work on together in either well in some marketing plus project management capacity in order to fund everything else and keep our saws so we'll put this here then the other thing would be so i see the next level down would be hybrid coaching group. Yeah, I'm not gonna call it group where we get to serve mid to get, I'll say mid level. Because this helps us ascend our audience. The higher level helps us refine our teaching serves as energy for us because we're in the community of people who are doing things and have experience, but don't need a ton for us. Yes, we end. they are doing things that we don't. have a high level of commitments to them. Also funds, whatever we are building.

> in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.

> And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.

> Yeah, so any, but attention to detail and even caring about things, you know, it's, so what gets on path to these radar, for example, is the only thing that's on a radar is, hey, there's calls and nobody's answering them. Now I'm going to look around and see what people are doing, or is she in the habit of looking around and saying what people are doing. So to the point of the quality of team and who's showing up and being active and doing things, especially if they're all getting the same incentive, which totally with that type of behavior seems wildly unfair and demotivating, which is why you have to catch other things that you can reward if you can't separate this type of thing. But, but is, you know like if I show up and I'm on time every single day and I never go over all my breaks or rarely right and I am not abusing time and I'm showing up and I'm doing a good job and maybe I'm not the best person but I try my best and then there's this drunk that comes I gotta watch my mouth but that comes in and he's late and he's belligerent or rude or lying or whatever and like we're all getting the same reward and like nobody cares that he's just screwing around because he does it one more slow so like nobody's noticing but he's just hanging out like I'd be annoyed so um dealing with something because there's an issue is not high level leadership and management do you know what I mean that that's reactive is anybody paying attention and trying to optimize things like just the way people show up and act and and how they punch in and whatnot and I don't know what level you at that to me. It's not micromanaging. It's just understanding. It's inventory, right? Human resources are part of your business. And you've got an entire team of six, seven people here that nobody's paying close attention to. It's passing listening to their calls regularly.

## Quote 15

> Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
