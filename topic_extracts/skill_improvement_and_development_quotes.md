Are you there? You're muted, by the way.
00:00:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I'm here.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian
Good.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. was a week then.
00:00:26 - Patrick Shahverdian
Pretty good week.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, tell me about it. Workways.
00:00:34 - Patrick Shahverdian
Got some settlements in. got a big demand expiring tomorrow. So fingers crossed. But we hit the settlement will today. It's to Lorenzo and I. He helped get a policy limits on a case that I had him second voice. So it's good.
00:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's working. I didn't hear that. Let's see. So how come it got so close to the deadline of expiring?
00:01:10 - Patrick Shahverdian
On that one, it's, that was your worst been negotiating for like a week and a half. But the case tomorrow, it's a really big one. And on big ones, they'll typically take up to the deadline. And they're entitled to wait until the last day to respond. So I followed up last week. They said they'll get back to me. So we'll see what happens tomorrow.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing that you feel like your team dropped the ball on or anything.
00:01:45 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, we're obligated to give them 30 days. So they want to take the full amount and they're entitled to do that.
00:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. There's still lots of things I don't understand about the processes. So when you say expiring, I'm like, OK, so it was. Um, like, expiring meeting that they have to respond by that day. Got you. you. Hi, Lorenz.
00:02:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, how's going?
00:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. That was an awesome email update you sent.
00:02:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, well, I was over to you.
00:02:15 - Patrick Shahverdian
apologize for the delay.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all right. Uh, I thought that that would be a good jumping off point to go over in our call today together if you're okay with me sharing it.
00:02:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, that's fine.
00:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so, um, just let's see. I'm trying to figure out how to do this. Um, I think the best thing to do would be. I'm going to share and I'm going put this in your notes in the bottom. Um, and. All right, so I'll do it, I think. Everybody see? Okay, so this was your monthly one of ones? Yeah. I love this. Can you tell us the structure real quick of how, like, what we're talking points?
00:03:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How did you handle your meetings? How long did they take? Okay, so yeah, as scheduled an hour, we're trying to be done in about 30 minutes. But that way if it goes over this particular issues, we have plenty of time. for them to feel like we're, you know, they're being listened to. And then the way I structure it is we go, you know, basically over, I try to ask them how they're doing, and usually they're telling some defense or about how they're happy and, you know, everything is great. It's like I try a little bit and I break it up into where the biggest stress is from, that comes from the client aspects aspect of your job. And what are the biggest stresses that come from the firm, the administration aspects of your job or the structure or whatever. And so I try to keep it pretty organic. Like I don't, you know, them an agenda in advance. tell them, you know, kind of what I want to talk about. But we kind of move through those, those things pretty organically. And then I go, once we discuss those things, it kind of segues naturally into coaching points, things that, you know, we can come up together about how they can improve, how we can address their concerns and improve their performance at the same time. And then that lead, that naturally leads into goals on things that we, I want to see them work on in the next month until the next time. All right. Good.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how, did all of these happen last week?
00:05:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, actually they happened like two weeks ago. Okay. Just really bad at, you know, finding the time to digitize all this.
00:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you, so something that you could do is just, have, use your phone as a recorder, and then figure out, I could help you with this if you wanted, I don't know if it would be helpful, but it's just something to consider, but or set something up recording on your computer actually would be better because then the file would be good, and then we could give it to like an AI to scan it, but you'd have to check it and make sure that it's right, and it may not even save enough time for you, but that's something that I could teach you how to do, and it could be fairly quick, and it may save you a little bit of time, but it also may help you capture something that you forgot to take a note on, because one thing that I have always struggled with and why I do like the AI note takers despite the fact that they capture things incorrectly is that I find it difficult to be, to take really good notes and also have a really good meaning, like I can be fully present in the conversation, Or I can fully capture the conversation, but I can't do both really well.
00:07:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's true.
00:07:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's something to consider that you could do that. And even if it's just recorded and then go back over later to make sure you did something. But what I want you to consider, both of you, is that there's a lot of leverage in those types of meetings, the feedback that you get. And the opportunity to take that and to improve it and to also look for the leverage in that feedback is is potent. So, for example, the conversation you had with John, who feels like he doesn't have enough time in the day to do everything he wants to do, you brought up the conversation that we had that is about efficiency. Why does he want to spend more time, probably because he feels like he could serve the clients better? And the end result is that it isn't about the time, it's about the result, right? Yeah. They really didn't come to Sweet Law to find a friend and they came here to get their issue taken care of and to get the greatest settlement that they can so that they can have the healing from their injuries and whatever else taken care of, right? So and you talked to him about that.
00:08:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I had mentioned to him that 10 years I've been practicing, I've never closed a case and after the fact that the client called me to see how I was doing.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that as an example. That is an awesome example.
00:08:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They only call when they need something.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And then how did he respond to that?
00:08:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I told him that. told him, look, know, it's the reason. They like you or want to have a relationship. you ship with you, it's to the extent that you can help them. And if the only thing you provide is a good listening ear, that's not enough for how much money they're paying. They need, you know, they need their their law firm to be efficient to work on their cases rather than. And, you know, that's all I told him, look, you can, it's fine to listen to clients, and they'll probably feel a little bit better for five minutes afterwards. But ultimately, you know, the reason they hire us is because of the service we can provide to them. They have friends already.
00:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a feel even better when the case is resolved than they were for that five minutes of conversation.
00:09:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But the question was, how did John respond to that? Did it? How did he respond? Yeah, he said he agrees. You know, he says he agrees in theory is just like when he's in the moment, he has a hard time.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make him a sign.
00:09:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Make him a little sign. Dickey never entered. I told him you'll set a timer to it. Yeah, I really.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have the timer though, but there's something really powerful about a visual reminder and what and have him write a note for himself if it's helpful, but I would suggest that it is and he should try it and write it in his own language and ask him, you know, like, do you believe that that that's true? Do you believe that you can serve them better by moving their case along and getting it resolved? So the first thing that you need to know is does he agree with that and is he bought into that? Does he really understand it or does he disagree? Because if he's not really bought into that mentality, he's going to keep struggling. He's going to continue to feel this this pull and this dissonance when, you know, he's trying to push a call through and I don't have enough time in the day. So,
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What you're saying is give him the tools to implement the conversation you've had.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's multiple parts of it, right? So he clearly still had some conflict over what is the best thing to do. Because if he didn't have conflict, he would have just been like, you're right, I gotta move forward. Because he would have been agreeing that that is the best thing he can do and the best way he can serve them. That doesn't sound like that's what he said. Did it not sound like there's still some conflict to you?
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think, well, I think I understand what you're saying. I think you're saying like if he really believed in it, he would. be able to to keep the conversations short. But the fact that he still has a hard time in practice shows that he doesn't really believe in it.
00:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what you're saying? Yes. So and it's a matter of priority. So a lot of times, most of the time, people are not conscious of priority period. They haven't even made a choice to decide that there is a thing that matters most. And I'll tell you how you can tell that this shows up in lots of people. People will say, I'm a family man. I love my family so much. then they spend 80 hours a week in the office. Those two things do not really say the same value. Now, there are different ways that that happens, right? if you think that the most valuable thing that you have to give to your family is financial security, then then that's an alignment. But if you ask your family what they value most, they'd probably say your time over that financial security. It's not always true. But my point is that there are a lot of times where we tell ourselves a half truth, right? We don't complete the story. So I'll give you an example for me. It was that my children are the most important thing to me. And then I heard somebody talking about how we save our best manners for strangers. And they gave examples of one and you're like, oh yes, thank you. No, whatever. Even when you're mad, really being polite to people and then going and snapping at kids. And I was like, I do that. I was so upset with myself. I was like, why would I let anybody else have better manners than my children. So let, lady, you're annoying me, you're going to get my attitude and my kids are going to get that happy because I'm going to let you have what you just are. I mean, I'm not, I am. I'm really that girl. Anyway.
00:14:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but there's, there's fewer immediate consequences, right?
00:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing that I want you guys to really notice is a lot of times we have half conversations with other people, half conversations with ourselves. We don't really explore the fullness and one of the things that rarely gets really clearly defined is values, almost everywhere you go. So we have a concept of a value, but what we don't do is go, okay, of the things that I'm facing right now, which is the greatest value? Because there are almost always convening values, in everything that we do. So, you know, for salespeople, maybe you think you're a person of integrity, and also maybe you've got a sales quota. A lot of times, that integrity drops priority to hit the quota. So we want to look for where there are competing values. So John's value is maybe I want people to like me. Does he like to be liked? Does he need to be liked?
00:15:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'd say so. Yeah, he's definitely not.
00:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a yes, I know nothing about John, but just by this habit, I can tell that about him.
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:15:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is deeply ingrained and not going to change quickly. And it's not going to change without his conscious effort. So first, he has to be conscious of the fact that he needs people. People don't like him. Is he handle distributions, Lawrence?
00:16:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What's that?
00:16:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
Does he handle distributions?
00:16:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Kind of. We we have distribution meetings and I drive the negotiations and then they send they send off the the final distribution to the client. Client has needs some questions answered. They'll try to answer the questions first and then I'll come in.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is your concern Patrick that that's not a good batch?
00:16:43 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, the reason I ask is because I used to kind of have the same tendencies as John. When I first started and like every client was like super important, I would spend all this time with them. The reason I kind of stopped like really investing so much time and just talking with them is because when it would come time to dish. distribution and they would see the amount that they were gonna get they would just totally change and it was like Yesterday you were saying all these nice things and now happy you were for all the help and then now that you see the number you're getting this like totally Opposite bad review like so that kind of helped me understand that like you know I'm gonna do my best to help these people, but I'm not gonna Spend all this time just talking to them getting them to really like me because at the end of it They're probably gonna turn around and be mad at you for the amount that they're getting any ways So that's when I like really felt it on my skin and I was like that's when I kind of understood what dynamic I should have with them Yeah, I guess that's like two ways of saying the same things is I think I'm I'm concerned with Is it is not establishing solid boundaries right away, but you're saying
00:18:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
those boundaries, you and Patrick are saying those boundaries come from values.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His value is I feel good by making them feel good. I want them to like me and be happy with me. What you need to do is remove the veil of falseness, which is that's not even real. There is no friendship, they don't like you, they may be in a good mood and happy with you for moment because you're doing something. But number one, if your real value is I want to do the best job that I can for them because they'll be as happy as they can be with it, then the best job is the best job and that isn't about listening to them and feeling like they're in a good mood. That's a pacifier. That's thumb sucking is what it is. It's don't say that's it.
00:18:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's a Tina with no sound skills.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Always people's favorites, but it's what it is. It's placating himself. actually, not the client. So what you need to do is find a way. And it's important. The reason I'm making sure it's very clear to you is because what you need to do is walk down that path. And so you can try to say it as gently as possible. But if you have to tell him he's basically sucking his thumb for his own comfort, if you know what but that they that they can see is true to go. Oh, and some people will never hear it. And that is important also. You need to know can they acknowledge the truth? Because if they can't, you cannot coach them better. So you're going to continue to have this issue. Then you have to decide, you know, trade offs being what they are. Is that an issue you can tolerate? Or is that an issue that you need to coach towards termination? And, you know, if all other things being considered, he does a good job. Sometimes we just have to tolerate that people aren't doing a great job because that's the situation that we're in. so, but you at least need to know where that's at, because also you don't want to just keep having the same conversation over over But, as you can see, like we've spent 15 minutes talking about this. There's a lot of nuance to it, nuance to why these issues happen and how you can resolve them if you can resolve them and understanding what the default behavior is in a person that causes them to operate in a certain way. Sometimes it's just because of ignorance. Sometimes it's because of psychological. this needs that they want to have net and they're just not aware and sometimes they can fix it and sometimes they can't. So you understanding why the thing happens first as his supervisor is important. So then maybe that you can find a way to help them through that. So and it comes up and other things. All right, so let's move on past that, ponder that a little bit, kind of come up with an action plan, trust your instincts, you know him, you know, use your own language to have those conversations, but consider the conversation about values, about needs like needs to be liked and and helping him be aware and decide, you know, what he wants to work on in himself. end in the business and also discuss competing values, the value of doing the best job or feeling the best about it for a little while while he's on the call with the person because those two really don't have any true relationship as Patrick illustrated. Okay, you so, man, there's a lot we probably spend most of this time talking about everything that went through on these meetings because on your meetings and notes that you took, because this is going to be about leadership and managing your resources. So I'll make sure to save a little time at the end. And if there's anything like Patrick, if there's anything you want to bring up. And we'll talk about this, but because you talk such really good notes, even even if it took you two weeks, these are good notes. So focus on the win, not that we could have done better. We can all always do better. better, you know, that's true, but this is good. One that you had the meetings, two that they were thorough, and three that you had good notes, and also your notes illustrate your understanding of it. And I can tell that you coached well. So that was good. Okay. So you talked about efficiency. I've also got some Patrick sent me an email. not sure if we talked about it together. I want to go over some of the stuff that he shared to. I don't know, my days are like 10 years ago was like yesterday and yesterday was like 10 years ago, like, and it gets worse. older I get. Okay. Anyway, stressed out about older cases, talked about the need to just touch them at least once a week, and they won't seem overwhelming. Okay. So I loved this. One of my strengths is consistency and it's movement. And it doesn't matter if it's a something very powerful. At the end of the day, when you go and you kind of take inventory and take stock of what I have. up in, you don't have those big goose eggs right on the board. don't have like, I did nothing here, nothing here, nothing there. You may not have a win all across the board, but you have movement. And there's something very powerful psychologically at the end of the day when you're going through that without having those big zeros. You know what I mean? Knowing that there was nothing that didn't get touched that needed to be. And so what people tend to do a lot of times is procrastinate, you know, and just leave themselves a whole bunch of stuff to do. But when part of the job is waiting, and most of the job is waiting, waiting for insurance to get back to you, waiting for the client to get back to you, waiting for all these different things, the frequency of the touches has a whole lot to do with how well that case goes. It should never be held up by Sweet Law. Never. everything should be moved on your end, steadily, all the way through. One of the things that can help that is the kind of the time-blocking that I think that we talked about a little bit, sometimes like the days run into each other, client conversations run into each other because I'm talking about the same thing all the time. But it is doing like tasks with like tasks, like and Patrick and think last week, which is you know distributions, types of conversations. So if the work is making phone calls versus writing things up versus checking email. Keeping like stuff with like stuff will help you get into a flow better rather than constantly changing types of tasks.
00:25:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense Lorenz?
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out of curiosity pastor, did you have any thoughts about that? Since we spoke about it last week, did it come up for you at all?
00:26:13 - Patrick Shahverdian
What topic exactly like categorizing doing certain tasks together?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so one of the things that we talked about specifically was checking email frequently versus just trying to get in a rhythm of certain types of tasks, letting it come to some type of clothes rather than going, oh, there's an email or something else.
00:26:36 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, like yeah, I've been checking it less throughout the week after we spoke. But like this morning, it was like, and I walked in and checked my email. saw there was like a few distributions that needed to get done and it was like an hour just spent on that. You know, getting the client's addresses to send checks, sending it to counting, so that was like an hour block. off just to get those done. After that, I think I wrote two demands. that was like sometimes spent there. And then I just did like, had some offers, gave the clients calls about offers. That was like another 30 minutes. So it does make things quicker because I'm in the state of mind of negotiating or, you know, convincing a client to sign something. It's not like I'm going from, you know, a bad conversation with an adjuster and then have trying to sway the client to sign a distribution. It's like, yes, angry to know I need to be very convincing.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, you know, so it's energy management and mental focus. And I love, I'm so glad that you were able to observe even any kind of shift in the week, because what happens is that gets even better. Because I'll take it back to consciousness. Like we were talking about. consciousness and values and people generally just not even being conscious of the fact that the thing that they're doing is based on a value. Sometimes the value is fun. I'm doing this because this is fun. Sometimes the value is, and frequently, consequence avoidance, right? Almost, I don't even know what the percentage is, but if you think about what you watch a lot of people do, it's consequence avoidance. Something got their attention and they're doing it because they don't want something bad to happen. The proactive people who are constantly working because they're building and they're creating intentionally, do you think that that's the majority of the people that you know? Just kind of scan people in your life. People who are always on purpose, always like, I'm doing this because of this because of this because of this because this is what I want. Or is it more like, yeah, I got to do this. I got to do this, because otherwise this, and I got to do that, because otherwise this, right? So what you're doing is becoming the first person who is intentional about everything, everything, rather than reacted and consequence avoiding, you are driving towards a specific consequence, only good consequences, right? By being more conscious about why you do these things and how you spend your time, rather than like I said last week, to, I got an email or some sort of stimulus, a phone call, just a thought that popped into your head, oh, I should do this, which is me ADHD. So I got to really think about, okay, wait, don't do that just because a pop, a head popped popped in your head. Do that because it is that the thing to do right now. So the compounding effect of the way that you're choosing to behave is first of all, because you're allowing yourself to. to get into flow, you're going to get better at all of those processes way faster than you would have if your bed mode shifted constantly. So you'll probably get better at distributions because you're staying in a zone for a little while, you'll probably get better at all those types of tasks. Now that won't be as noticeable as quickly, but I'm going to tell you it will happen. Have a little faith in me, trust me, keep watching it because you tried that experiment and you're like, Oh, was actually. But the other thing is, and I don't think I brought it up to you last week, maybe I did, but you brought it up is the energy shift. So that's a really important thing, things that make you grumpy. I think we have talked about it at one time.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Have I told you guys about energy sandwiches that sound ring about little?
00:30:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing, right? Some of the things that we do really suck. And specifically, some of the things we do make us kind of probably in a bad mood because they're contentious by design. So, Well, distributions is doesn't have to be contentious, but it can be probably as a lot of times dealing with certain insurance companies, they farm, know, there's it's conflict. So that's not something you want to do where you got to go, you know, try to get something out of a client because that's going to put you in bad mood. So you want to sandwich something that kind of regulates you in between. So email might be a good time because you can like calm down a little bit, take a beat and then go make phone calls where you're not taking the energy of dealing with this negative person to this client. Does that make sense? So, like I said, there's a lot of tiny little things about how you do your day to day stuff that has nothing to do with the law has nothing to do with a lot of things, but just the way you think. And just the way you choose to do your work. So keep that in mind. Stress about all the cases. Okay, touching them stress about him. getting firm numbers. So I love this. When he feels like there are so many things outside of his control zone, client response time, clients following through with treatment insurance limits. And you talked about how to do the things that we can control really well in order to minimize the effect of things that we don't control. I was like, yes, I read that and I like, you go friends, that was awesome. And I can totally see Pat in his very calm demeanor, saying the same type of thing. Like, who is he doing that? Because I feel like you're trained for that, for the military. I just know you shared enough that I think that that's something you would do.
00:32:39 - Patrick Shahverdian
Am I wrong?
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. All right. So good job, you guys. Okay. So John still wants to know what he can do to make his job a long term career that allows him to provide for his growing family. And you talked about how to become indispensable by consistently growing as a case manager, team lead. Mentor for Mary and Paralegal. I love that. That is one of my favorite things. have two kind of I don't know, M.O.'s part of my M.O. two aspects to my M.O. which would be one having unimpeachable character. That means I am the same everywhere. My feistiness, I will punch an old man in church if he's encroaching upon a young lady's face. I don't care. You can be high priest. I don't care. If you crowd a knee back off and if you don't take the signal, I have punched people. Okay. I'm a defender at all times. I'm enthusiastic all times. I love God and Jesus at all times. I sometimes swear really badly. Jesus loves me at all times. You know, but that means because I'm the same everywhere that I go that if somebody says something and it is out of alignment with my character, everybody's gonna do know that that's not true. Even if they don't like me and they don't want to defend me, they'll just be like, that's not possible because she's literally always the same person. So unimpeachable character meaning just you're just the same and you're person of quality and integrity. I sometimes I'm not the most polite I can be rude, but I'm never hurtful, I'm never vengeful, I'm never dishonest, I'm never um anything that somebody would go like those qualities, right? So that's one thing. The other thing what was the oh this I am always seeking to increase my value to those I serve. So I think everybody is technically replaceable, but that word indispensable is one that I'm always looking for. I've been a consultant for 22 years. My business is 100% what I'm mouth. I have not done any marketing and it's been a six figure business for working about 10 to 15 hours a week, by the way, since, I don't even know, it's about nine years. So, I have the people pay me a lot and in my industry, I am an anomaly. This doesn't happen. My business stands out even at like the highest level coaches. There are a few exceptions that that can do what I do, but almost nobody does. And here's why is because when I feel like, and this has happened several times, I feel like we're having the same conversations and we're just maintaining, but we're not growing. Well, my job is growth. My job is improvement. They can maintain if they get to the point where they're like, yeah, Tina, I'm doing all the things you taught me. I've got nothing else to teach them, then I don't lose that client. I don't want to, mostly because all my clients are really awesome, but also because then I've got to go replace that and I don't want to do that either. So I'm always sharpening my saw. I'm always looking for a way to be better at what I do. I'm looking at the new technologies, I'm improving my study of psychology, I'm improving my study of leadership, I'm improving my study of operations, and because I'm always growing, and also because I'm working with people who are always growing, that conversation continues to evolve and I know that they're not having that conversation anywhere else. Plus I'm paying attention to them, I'm taking notes, I'm thinking about what they're working on throughout the week. I don't just talk to them and then I don't think about them until I talk to them again the next week. And so because of that, I know because most of us don't have somebody that is really paying close attention to how well we're doing, and looking to make sure that we're doing better every week. So I know that I'm serving a very unique function for people that probably no one else is serving except for maybe their mama's. No. And so what you said is great is what are the functions that he can serve that maybe other people in the team aren't serving or what can he do best, but because we can't all do, like there are some things I just, I don't pay attention to details really well. So I do if I'm listening, but if you're going to give me a 20 page document, I'm never going to read it and I'll read half of it because I will read a paragraph and then there's my place and think a new thought and my brain just can't focus. So we've all got weaknesses, things that we don't do really well. The point is not to try to get better at the things that we don't do well. The point is to be excellent at the things that we do well because that's already in our real house and what that does is create so much lift that where our weaknesses creates drag the lift over compensates for that does that make sense uh so I love that you did that how did he respond to it um I mean he he was positive and he agreed with me which is his natural response you know that did he and this is what I want you to listen for and I also want you to tell him if he doesn't give this to you that this is what you're looking for and the conversation is not going to end until he does this which is give me an example of how you would do that what do you think about when I say that what does that look like to you open ended so he can't parent your words back to him and if he tries to parent your words back to him you say okay but that's what I say said. In your own words, what does that mean? What does that look like? And then you can just be quiet and let him sit in the awkwardness. However long it takes until he decides to not well also did you know that I think it's like two twelve is statistically across the board the least productive minute of the hour of every day and guess what our meaning is it's right around there so I won't take it personal just little bit just little bit and I'm sick did you eat oh that's not good did you eat chicken or beef I did the chicken first today so now you get to look forward to the beam all right all right all right this is last Please come and say some words. Um, so with John, there's, there's a little work to do, but I love what you're doing. I love the goals, nine cases ready for demand, 200 K and fees. So what I would like to see, I don't know if you have this next week is, and this may take some time in my brain literally can't even picture the start of it because generally when I want something like this, I will create a foundation. But I would love to see team steps, um, with all the cases that you have, who's working on what on a spreadsheet and then what that equates to monetarily so that we can track that improvement so that we can track your performance, your leadership performance. Obviously, we're going to have the big number at the end, which is what are the gross to. but if we break it down by how each individual set of goals impacted that bottom line number, then you'll be able to have an even bigger impact to that bottom line number, because now you know what the little levers are, right? specific goals by what specific people was able to create that lift?
00:41:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:41:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Patrick, can you do something like that for your team too?
00:41:31 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah, I mean, I've still yet to speak with Cynthia for a monthly meeting, but I spoke with Elsie on Friday.
00:41:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we can start. Maybe you guys like could power out together or we can just do it on a meeting together, because pacing wise, it isn't massively urgent. It's as important as it is important to you. But I promise you that the experience of organizing your data, visually so that everybody can see where we are, what the the micro goals are for the macro goal, which is, you know, whatever your attorney fees target that you're trying to hit and settlement fees. There's something really powerful when you see the numbers there, especially when you see the pattern of the numbers and how it's changed over time. And generally, with almost no exception, I'm just going to say, because I can't think of an exception, there probably is one. But when you start to visualize and you have those goals, and the reason there's no exception is generally because of the people that I work with, the caliber that they are and the caliber of their teams and their efforts and whatever, is that it automatically starts improving. And then what happens is people see their improvement. So a lot of their self doubt and their excuses go away. because the evidence is irrefutable and they know everybody else is seeing what they're doing good plus they also see everybody else is good so that kind of inspires competition but in a healthy way really you want people to compete against themselves not everybody else so whatever your best is this month best it next month if you can we know that seasons don't really work that way and really prefer overall looking at year over year rather than month over month uh because of the dips so you just want to make sure that the average is increasing remember how we looked at your document um Lorenz and we were looking at the averages which is also something on a gover let me any notes to self uh we'll do that for fathom so i want to remind myself that i want to go over oh attorney fees okay so anyway your spreadsheet with the Averages, but I also want to go to mark who said he will get us a report that you guys can look at that has Oh, he gave it to you.
00:44:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he didn't tell me not not not do attorney fees, but the settlements.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I Want you to see attorney fees too. I Want you to see everything. I want you to see who's hitting percent who's who's maxing Policy limits. I Want you to see all the stocks. Do you not want to know?
00:44:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah I feel like he's keeping that pretty close to the best. No, I don't think I don't think that's the case, but I I'm not asked No, well, that's not true because he does publish attorney fees once in a while doesn't he mark that trick Yeah, he doesn't do it at the end of the month. So like he doesn't do it on the last day of the month
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the reporting is inconsistent. I don't think it has anything to do with keeping close to the best, but Mark doesn't like doing that.
00:45:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I misspoke.
00:45:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think he keeps it close to the best. Yeah, I mean, even if he did and he chose to do it, there would be a reason for it and I would probably get behind it. So it's not an issue, but I'm just thinking based off of the conversations we've had that it's probably less of that report exists easily and making sure that everybody has access to the report. Because there has to be assignments and all of that stuff. anyway, but the average attorney fee plus total attorney fees plus cases, because if you guys can see that, both of you would feel pretty good about some stuff. And until I get to share that, I'm just going leave with her. right. So, you said she's happy and feels like she's learning a lot each day so and that she feels like. she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. Is that just like, did you feel really good about that?
00:46:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, and she's, you know, there's definitely things, you know, I still want to work on with her, but she is kind of growing into her own. It's good to see, it feels good to see that.
00:46:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just two months ago, she felt really guarded and you kind of had to pry things out. Yeah. And you set an intention of helping her feel safe. That was one of the first conversations I had with both of you is like, you know, be aware that you have the ability to do that for people. And from what I could tell, I didn't witness anything, but Viri seems very guarded and unsure. And for you to have a report like that two months later, when we only talk, you know, we've had maybe six conversations all together.
00:46:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, she's really, really kind of, you know, her shell is kind of cracked open.
00:47:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want you to think about this. Imagine that this is your, your wife your daughter or your mom or whatever, right? A woman that you care very much about. And she goes to work and feels like I don't want to lose my job and I'm kind of afraid to speak up. And then two months later, she comes back and she feels like she's happy. She's learning a lot and she's surrounded by people who are invested in her growth. How would you feel to see that woman that you cared about, have that kind of environmental change at work? Is that a little thing?
00:47:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, it makes me happy. I'm happy for them. proud for them. I'm proud that they're, you know.
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was my sister because my sister has had some issues with some terrible people and that she went from a place where it was a hostile environment to she felt like that. Life-changing. And I need you to understand that because you created that intentionally. That's really important. I think that you need to understand that you improved her quality of life, not just work, because do we not all take some of the stuff home with us?
00:48:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that's just, I'm just, that's a big win and I'm great job. Thank you. Okay. So feeling like she doesn't have enough time for tasks, ask her to set three non-negotiable tasks each day in order to prioritize more efficiently. I love that. And the other thing about that is you are helping her set wins and wins. Like I was talking about those goose eggs at the end of the day, they feel terrible. But if you have some big W's on the board, when you go at the end of the day, those goose eggs, that they are there, they don't feel as bad. You guys are understanding what I'm saying when I'm talking in that analogy, right? doing yes. Okay. No, Patrick, are you being a smart alec?
00:49:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
No, Goose, what do you mean by Goose?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goose egg, it's a zero.
00:49:17 - Patrick Shahverdian
Why does that do a geese?
00:49:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is some expression.
00:49:24 - Patrick Shahverdian
I figured it out, but I was just wondering. About the egg.
00:49:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, I lost you.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really hope that didn't freeze in some terrible looking. You did. Good thing I don't know what that looks like. Okay. Anyway, scoreboard, a big zero goose egg, right? So that means, you know, mentally looking at it as or an L, right? loss, something that didn't get done that is emotionally impacting you because you're like measuring all the things. that you should have done and you've got this, this weight of that wasn't there, you know, like imagine you're, you're in a, you know, tournament, you're looking at the scoreboard and it's a zero, like that just sits there grinding at you versus counting your win. So if none of us can get all the things done every day. So you had our set three non-negotiable tasks, which automatically insinuates that those were chosen by a priority, right, and a value, because how do you decide it's non-negotiable?
00:50:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
had to have some sort of valuation process.
00:50:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you, it was embedded in there, even if you didn't talk about it specifically, you did. And then what you gave to her is that if she is able to complete those three non-negotiable tasks, she automatically has three solid wins every day. Yep. that's really powerful.
00:51:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, something that we did in my last law firm. I want to add on to that, you know, as she builds that habit, but it's like a, I think it's Tony Robbins method for what is the three set three non-negotiable tasks. Eventually, you want to set like three tasks that are not as important, but it would be nice if they got done and that helps you organize your brain in terms of priorities rather than what's in front of you.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and it keeps you focused because if you're trying to think about everything, that's overwhelming. But if you're just focusing on those, those non-negotiables or Stephen Covey uses it as big rocks. It's a big difference. Okay, so feel safe with our team, challenge her to take a more active role in meetings and take more client calls. I love that. She wants to move 10 cases ready for demand. and then we'll push on collecting medications. Okay, so nice clear goals. started making intro calls for new clients and said she needed more training from John in order to feel more comfortable. So with John talking as much as he does, make sure that you record those calls so that you can also say, okay, here's what was great about that. Here's what I don't want you to do. Kind of thing.
00:52:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just. I have a plan actually. have a grand master plan about those intro calls.
00:52:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's that?
00:52:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me talk. Mike, if you scroll down to Mike, one of those goals is we're going to do this together as we we're going to start drafting an intro call script. And we want to make it pretty standardized across the board so that when files shift from one team to the The other is not like, well, why didn't we get that information? Now I got to go back and get that information myself. Um, love that because we're working on that with intake. Did you know that? Uh, yeah, Mark has hinted at it.
00:53:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We've been working on it for months, but we've been talking about it for over a year.
00:53:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So just, you know, takes a because that name, you know, the attorney intro call is a lot shorter. Welcome to the forum. Do you have any questions? know, this is kind of the process for 10,000 views is what's going to happen. My, my, my will be in touch with you. But from the assistance point of view, there's so many things to think about that I think sometimes they either focus too much on two or three points and not get the other points or sometimes they just like, it's like an over little bit of information we don't need. Yeah. They spend too much time on the floor on those intro calls.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you did that. And something else to consider is almost kind of a, like a game plan. So what do you do if this happens on the call? For example, they go off the rails telling us about all of this stuff, call control. We talked about call control skills, right? So to me, that's what you're implementing is a specific game plan for managing and controlling the calls that are had with the clients. Probably be done elsewhere too, but especially with the clients where people are often going to feel like the client is driving the conversation, but really we should always be driving. We know where they need to go. We know how they need to get there. We know what needs to happen. We know what's not helpful, you know. So I love that.
00:54:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I don't know, they all responded, I'll ask them all how they felt about bringing in some people to. give some training about regarding call control. They all were pretty excited about that.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is awesome.
00:55:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
an option that you're considering.
00:55:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just have to get Mar, where's my note that? On board that, okay. Team wants call control training. Yeah, I think that would be amazing. Having had that experience myself been like changing. Literally, because I use it in all kinds of conversations, like the way people use probably the numbers put the different kind of tactics. I use that all the time. And to be able to politely interrupt, nobody likes it. But even if you don't like it, you can help kind of assuase them so they don't there. and really focus on them as though everything else doesn't exist. But you need that context. need the things like, hey, Mark's the guy. can call it 10 o'clock at night or message at 10 o'clock at night and ask a question. And he's responding with help, not, hey, idiot, why didn't you get this figured out? It's 10 o'clock. Why are you bothering me? That kind of thing. You know what I mean? So that context matters. So Mark gets to be a human being like the rest of us. And if he stressed, you know, it might come out. So not excusing it if it's if it's ever bad and that if there's a conversation that needs to be had then have that. But I'm sure all of you are just like sometimes like if something's really stressed, it's hard to hide it. What we can do though is just make sure that what we say is true. So maybe he is disappointed. I get disappointed with things. I did it on the call with Mark yesterday. I was asking him about something. He said something I'm like, I am flabbergasted. You just said that to me. we Hey, I'm talking about this for three years, and I ask you this question, you telling me it's hard? I don't care if it's hard. Blah, Yeah, anyway, so. Okay. my God. He's still very nice to me though. Yeah, so anyway, again, if there's an issue that's a real issue that needs to be addressed, then let's have that conversation. But if it just is uncomfortable to be told, we could do better and we need to do better, and we don't like how that feels, we can probably get over that. Now, if you're being insulted, if you're being degraded, if you're being told you're worthless, if you're being like, why do you always fail? Like, you know what I mean? That type of stuff, that's unacceptable, that should not happen. But if you're being told you can do better, we've had this conversation multiple times, that's a real thing, right? So, keeping those and then really counting, okay, but what can we rely on?
00:59:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
ion and what that does for you is helps them make sure that they're looking at other people like that not just Mark or not just you but they could probably relate that to you too like if you get impatient from time to time and you give them this conversation then they would be like oh yeah I can relate that to Lauren because he was not happy about this but he's also the same guy that's like how are you doing how can I help you here's some tips blah blah blah you know what I mean like yeah and I and I reassured her that you know a lot of that is because she's working away from the office she doesn't get the physical instant feedback and physical cues and you know body language and expressions yep and so this it can be triggering when you don't get that feedback over time you kind of feel a little bit you can feel a little bit suspicious of everything everything everyone says you know
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you guys get kudos from Mark's like, hey, good job.
01:00:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You did this really well Yeah, he said good job to me a couple of times and that yeah, I mean Realistically Mark when that's concerned like I'm very focused on what what else can we do to to keep improving and So sometimes I forget to like let the people know that yes, you are improving. Yes, you're growing.
01:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, you're doing a good job I guess so what I'll ask him is being his coach also is like Do you feel like you look for an opportunity to compliment everyone? Sincerely, but it is One thing that we all need to do. So if and there's also a kind of, well, coaching. Okay. I'm complimented.
01:01:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel the same Patrick? I would really like your thoughts on that.
01:01:16 - Patrick Shahverdian
Well, he's told me good job. know, for me, I mean, because I don't have as much experience. Sometimes I don't know if I'm doing like enough for. Like sometimes I may feel like my numbers are good that month. But then he's like, you know, we suck this one. So I really don't know if I'm doing a good job sometimes, but I take it more as like. You know, he comes and talks to me basically every day, once a day, just to check in. So as long as he's not like bringing something up bet negative, then I take that as, you know, just keep going. Because like if there's something wrong, be like, hey, I need to get you to get this done or. So I don't expect them to be like a good job on every case.
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't think that's effective or whatever, but I do want to know, do you, um, because there may be subordinates, maybe they don't get as much interaction and maybe they only hear if something is wrong, but also I'm an extractor. So if I don't know how things are going, I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask everybody, I'll ask clients, I'll ask, like people may, I may report to them, but I don't think anybody's above me. Well, they are in respect, you know what I mean, but, but some people are never going to ask for that. They do need to hear some level of, you know, or they, for sure, at least not need to just hear what's wrong, you know what I mean? But female staff might be more inclined to feel that, I'm not sure.
01:02:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And Marci Fence, he is, like, I've discussed this with him before and he is very well aware of that. blind spot. And he's, you know, he's made, he's really, like, made lot of effort to go out of his way to help.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is members night and day from the time we started working together. So that's good. But it's just nuance. And we all need it. We all need somebody to help us see what our blind spots are. So it's not a pick on anything. And I wouldn't care about it. And I wouldn't be here if Mark didn't care very much about everyone and how he shows up. He shows up every single week. Has that passed away? He came to our call the next day. He's like, I'm not messing this. That was amazing to me. So, you know, we're talking about it, but we're talking about it because we're all here to grow. And I just want to know, so I wouldn't just be like, Hey, you're a jerk, but I would ask him.
01:03:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think, you know, to go back to Jessica, this is not about Mark. Like it is, but it isn't.
01:04:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's more about like, you know, when you feel isolated for a while and start thinking about disconnected. But that's also part of the structure of Sweet Laws. There's a lot of remote stuff. So what can we do to help facilitate that feeling of connection and that unity and that confidence. So if this is the structure that we choose to operate in, and that's the company that he's created, what can we do to help make sure that the human resources, right, are getting the human needs met and taken care of. So because he chooses to be the best leader that he can and he's always working on it, I want to know that so that I can share with him. What do you think about how you do this? Whatever. It's a small thing, but it's an important thing. And it's one of those things that we work on. And it's also something I don't get a lot of insight into because I'm not in the office. So and we only have an hour a week that we're talking. We've covered are a lot of browned so that's helpful but I promise you I'm not making it into a big thing be that okay anyway um 204 uh my concern with the amount of handholding necessary to take care of sweetball clients feels like it's eating into other clients times it's almost like the opposite of John um so that's interesting yeah if there are ever two polar opposites that'd be John might they are complete offices I would be really interested to see what happened if they um doubled up on each other's calls for a little bit and just you know like like Y swap kind of like what is this like um ponder on that a little bit because I don't want to take really much more time I want to go through this really quickly and then we'll just table the rest for our next time um concern with time management I love this three non-negotiables once they keep getting case closed out um want for more big cases there's not Not a lot of control over that. Everybody wants bigger cases. If Mark would have it be that every case is a big case, so there's that doesn't love case review, meaning I love that. So the one thing I wanted to point out here is that if we get some stats that everybody can watch, what you're going to be able to do is say, OK, is when this was our data before we started these team review meanings together. OK, and this is our data after. There is obviously a correlation because we didn't really change much else. And so as you start to implement things and you're watching your stats improve, you get to then reinforce their understanding that I didn't just tell you to do something randomly that it was strategic, that there was a reason for it. And here is the fruits of your labor. So in terms of just them being consistently, you're still doing the things that work because people tend to forget.
01:08:03 - Patrick Shahverdian
I don't know. I was thinking maybe for Jessica, like, you know, obviously she used to work here and now she's a remote, so maybe kind of reinforced the fact that, you know, Mark liked the work she did and allows her to continue to work remote because, you know, clearly he likes everybody to be in the office and, like, remote working is, like, last resort type of thing, so maybe that could... It's true. Reinforce her thoughts about how she's doing, like that.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I have only heard good things about Jessica and I don't hear things about pretty much anybody except the attorneys. I would always get her confused with America because he would have different tasks, he was doing certain things, and anyway, the point is I've heard good things, so that's something also.
01:08:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's what I told her, know, in my nose. That's basically what I explained. look, I know there's like a difference between like being in the office and not being in the office, but I can tell you from my end, I've not heard anything but good things from Mark and I want to, and Mary and everyone. think you should.
01:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you guys think about if we had just kind of like a Wednesday or something and like you or just some sort of highlight of somebody on your team did something good that you just make sure to pick out something good that anybody on your team did once a month and maybe I can get Mark to have this be like a sight-white thing, hey, just wanted to celebrate these people on my team. did this, this, and this and then maybe he, you know, do that for the attorneys too, but it's really, we're human and we do need to be told that we're doing a good job and there's a lot that happens when we get that public praise, know, we could just be like, oh, we're adults, we don't need that, but. We're human beings and we do need that. What do you guys think about me proposing that to him?
01:10:06 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'd be interested to see the structure so Yeah, I guess I've tried that with my kids and All they see is like I'm praising one of my kids and all the other ones see is that they're not doing that so Children is very different The timeline perspective and it's very selfish In because I'm working on my psychology degree.
01:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
learned a lot of things I had no idea and I wish that all parents knew and we really should have a manual. Okay, that's all I'm gonna say Subox off but That is part of it is just that the children are inherently and psychologically and development me developmentally very selfish and self-centered So it's an interesting correlation, but it's not probably the same thing and the thing is as it happens over time so like we could start it with let's celebrate everybody on a team okay so markets all his attorneys you guys get all your people and we just have a great big this is amazing you guys are amazing let's celebrate that and then after that maybe it's one one person each and we just intentionally rotate through and just keep it going because it really it feels good and we'll know it's not placating like you have to look for real things but you should be able to find them because the thing that there's quality people so and we don't want to phone in that effort we don't want to patronize them we want to say this was real and here's why it was real this is what value it brought to us it was a great job what do you think Patrick I think so I think it could get a little bit like I don't know how would it be like good job on getting this record in or no like really just so it could be a quality it could be a growth or something of improvement like I know
01:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian
is this quality.
01:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
noticed this behavior. I noticed this improvement. And, you know, and maybe we reduce the frequency.
01:12:09 - Patrick Shahverdian
That's what I'm concerned about.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like if it's like, everyone's that type of thing that's special, then it's like.
01:12:18 - Patrick Shahverdian
Yeah.
01:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So maybe we rotate with the attorneys in each week. One of the attorneys highlights one person on their team, or it could be the whole team. You know, it could be a win for the whole team. But really, they did want to make sure and pay attention and make sure that somebody's not left out and that everybody's getting celebrated. But yeah, so you guys would need to kind of brainstorm on what the frequency and structure would look like. But just the idea and the concept to make sure, especially because you guys are remote, like it could be a spotlight on the person, right? So you're not just talking about what they did great. It should be. something that's in there, but also who they are, what they like, how long they've been with sweet law, whatever. And as big as the team is, I mean, you could go one person a month or every other week or something like that. So there's ideas we don't have one defined yet, but I would love you guys to think about it. And just remember that these are human resources. We are people. We do have psychological needs. doesn't stop because we're on a job and getting paid. We'll do better and perform better if we take care of those psychological and emotional needs as well. Okay.
01:13:38 - Patrick Shahverdian
I do think it's important for sure.
01:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Well, you guys keep thinking about it because every week you impress me with all the things that you're learning and you're doing. And I think it's awesome. And I look forward to these calls. I was dead tired. I had zero energy. And then we're inside that email.
01:13:56 - Patrick Shahverdian
And you guys are here. And I froze in some really unattractive way now.
01:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just forget that image. You cannot see this anymore. Anyway, all right, you guys talk next week. Have a great week and that's it.
01:14:11 - Patrick Shahverdian
Good job. You too. Have a good long weekend.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Well, yeah, we're going to the beach. Bye. Bye. Take care. You too. Bye.

> 00:00:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hey, how are you doing?
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Apparently too eager to meet me because I got here to meet.
00:00:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, yeah, I to double check. Double check myself.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not going to meet you early then too late, but I woke up and I got immediately had missionary meetings to go to and anyway, I was just been like, oh, I'm on to my next meeting and yeah, anyway, so I gotcha.
00:00:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. When you said I woke up, I finished the sentence in my head as soon as when you said I woke up, I was like, I woke up and I chose violence.
00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I, I don't know why I just feel like, well, I eat, so how do you feel about Tina? Well. The vibe she gives off is she chews this balance. I can't be like that. really wrong. I'm coming down in my old age. feel like this mission is probably really good for my attitude. Anyway, so I put notes on your last... Oh wait, okay, so just the invoice thing just to keep up with it. because I put them on, what think go automatically every month? And then when we started back, it was the first of whatever month it was like April. And so there's another one automatically going to come in a few days.
00:01:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there...
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that right?
00:01:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Is there anything wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. I guess I just got off in my... I probably was late on one of the earlier ones.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then... So there's a remind function that I can use, and I just wanted to make sure, you know, because in the beginning, like I think your finances have straightened out and whatever, but I just want to make sure everything's okay. And then if it, we need to adjust it, let's adjust it.
00:02:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, yeah, it's finances. The third month in my cycle of billing with titans and everything. I consistently get to that third month and it's like, oh, this is going to be, this is going to be tight. I've got, you know, I've got nine grand in my account right now. And that's for the rest of August and September. And I'll have mean, a little bit from VA and BAM. I have some money coming from Tim, which he, I'm talking with him. He wants to renegotiate, so I'm talking with him about that now to do a profit partner deal with him, so he wants to scale back to, he asked me to scale back to 3K a month, and so I talked with him, got on the Zoom last week and was like, you know, obviously like I can't, if we, if we do two things. So one, we ran that one promotion, you know, you, you, you did a little over 40k, one person signed up for your mastermind, and he, and he was, you know, that, and I think he's got some, some um, uh, some amex debt that he's dealing with, because I heard him mention he's paying like 2,500 a day on it.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:04:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I think he's got, yeah, a day. Wow. I think he's got some, uh, I think the money just comes in and it goes, but he's got a big event that I'll be at next month in Chicago and I've been really not installing it.
00:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, sorry. I'm just like, so anxious right now because I'm so upset and I'm trying to hold my mouth.
00:04:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Keep going. Sorry. Yeah. And so I, um, you know, I've been promoting that event, uh, for him because that's really when he wanted to focus on and because that's where he sells people into his mastermind and we've got more people attending this event than any of the past five. um, know, he converted 25% of the room last year. if he does that this year, you know, that's like a little over 700 grand to him. So he may feel different post event. But I told him that we got to reduce the scope. If we're doing 3k, I said a way around that. And this is why I proposed to him. And he said, he'd give me a half, a half yes on this because he likes, he just wants to think about it. So I said him the proposal. And I went ahead and I invoiced him for 3k because I need that money. I need some of that 5k coming in this month. But it would be 5% of gross sales that I bring in, including evergreen funnels that I build. And so in my goal would be you know, make up that extra, you know, 2K a month, but also it's like, well, he, the other thing in my mind is like, well, I probably, I probably need to go ahead and get working on another client as well that can pay me the 5K. And, you know, I do, I do like working with him and his team, you know, there's something to be said for that. He paid me, he's paid me 20 grand so far. So, I, as I did in Moison for the 3, and I got that and then, and his whole thing, he said, it's not that you, like, is nothing that you're, you're doing, like, he, he, like, likes to work and he just isn't able, I guess isn't able to afford 5k. So I feel like there's something to be said for, you know, he's not breathing them my neck. Like I have pretty much full autonomy. So there's some pros and cons there. So I'm trying to be flexible and also stand up for myself too. so if he were to say, you know, I'm not going to do the 5% of growth of what you sell, I'll probably just eke out another month or to a 3k and find some how to replace it. But also I said the near-road scope would be like I'm just going to focus on creating and running promotions. under this new deal and you know because they'll ping me like for I mean just random stuff and it doesn't take me that long but but that kind of stuff I would just you know back away from and not not do any more you're updating existing sales page copy that I'm not really involved in or anything like that or that we don't have a promotion for so so that kind of stuff would would go away and I would just focus on activities that bring me in that I can earn them and so I think it's a really good deal for him and so I think he'll say yes I I send it to him I sent it to him on Friday, yes, sent him Friday, and I know he's looked at it, he hasn't replied. I'll follow up with him before the gross summit next week just to confirm that he saw it and say let's connect after gross summit because I think that he'll be in a happier place once he has that influx of new members, and I've helped him with the order form that he's going to pass out at gross summit and a little bit with his presentation of how he's going to pitch our encircle. So, mean, I think that like today, he got an email deliverability warning from Keep because the spam complaints are getting a little high and he asked me if I could take a look look and you know that that's one of those things is like that's that's definitely out of scope but i but i know that he's using email smart which is Adriene sappages software okay and and so i did send a talk about sending email to the because i know those guys really well because they we have brian so i just an email see if they can advise or consult with him but i'm not going to work on his email deliverability um so well we're seeing that that leads but i yeah there they're kind of two things floating in my mind is like man i'm tired of getting to that third month and and just feeling the crunch and and i did have a couple of expenses that i didn't anticipate one was paying my EPA that I thought I'd already pay back in in tax season, but we did an extension that we're filing now. And I guess he built me now. So that was like 1,700 bucks that I wasn't expecting. And then there were, there were some kid expenses on the personal side, but can I dig into this a little bit real quick?
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So first of all, let's cut my bill in half because you don't talk to me at all other than our meetings. So like, you know, extra effort, and it's old prices and we'll just, you're just grandfathered and keep what I charged hourly basically. So we'll cut that in half. That's not a huge out, but it's something and it let us keep working together. Because that's really important to me. Yeah, me too.
00:11:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
If you like it. I do.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we'll start that next invoice. If you see it and I haven't fixed it yet, because I can forget between now and two minutes that I need to do that, just pee me back and say, Hey, don't forget. And then I'll fix it. Okay. It would just be an oversight. It wouldn't be. I changed my mind. know. And then if you end up being a little bit late, because you're in a crunch or whatever, however, don't about it. It'll just need to take care of it when you take care of it. Yep.
00:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's one thing.
00:12:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. This guy.
00:12:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his face? Top home?
00:12:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tim. Tim, Tim. So, um, he's, he's feeling the pain of his mismanagement and his errors and a lot of times people will displace that responsibility or just make really dumb choices because they're not in a good way. one of the things. things that you can do is the math, because the numbers tell the truth, right? So what you do is you put in a spreadsheet and you compare the price that he's paid you and the money that you know you've helped him earn. And the no brainer math that says, uh, we've our, I've already earned that. Okay. But in addition to that, that there's the unquantifiable kind of help that I've given you that hasn't been measured, such as this kind of advice, this kind of consulting and, and peer support really. Um, and, and so, you know, so it's, and, and you are not in the business of charity. And I would, I would really say these things in your way, but I think that this, this is one of those things that you write up or you do like in a video, so that you have a chance to really kind of script it out in your head. And so that you don't get interrupted and shift your energy. So he doesn't like argue and persuade or anything because sometimes people like that, especially when they're desperate, they really try to control the conversation. Yeah. And you need to make sure that his ego doesn't get in the way. So if it's if it's a long text or video, he can't argue with those things as much. He might end his brain, but he gets a little bit of space where nobody's listening to him and watching him and where he can manage his ego if he chooses to. So it gives him a better chance to be able to deal with his ego if you handle it that way. And I would imagine he might want to, because if we don't manage our egos, then, you know, we sabotage. But so you give him the math and show him, like, obviously, I've already earned my cape and I want to do more. This lights me up. I enjoy it. I understand the financial problems that you're in. I've been there. for myself. However, here's what I know. Getting rid of the golden egg, the golden goose kind of thing, or getting rid of the money producers out of a scarcity mindset is absolutely the wrong thing to do. And I'm going to put my time somewhere that is going to come back to me. You know, that's just business. But also in this economy, everybody's got to manage their resources. Well, I only have so much time and so much mental effort to apply to a project. So I'm not going to put it where I constantly feel like I have to prove myself or somebody doesn't understand the value. So I'd like you to take some time to contemplate this, look at the numbers and reevaluate. And you know, you could just read, read, restate that. That's why this offer is good, because I see your value. I know what you could earn. I know that there's a good potential for me and I'm willing to have some skin in the game by instead of requiring this 5,000 that I'm going give you my minimum. What do I call that?
00:16:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Retainer, base retainer, base retainer.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Man, it's been so long since I've used the base retainer. I forgot what it's called. This base retainer, which basically ensures that I am not a victim of your poor money management. And of course, you're going to probably want to tweak that, but that's the truth of it is sometimes people manage their money bad in case in point 2,500 day on an AMEX. Something went wrong there. So it's just a matter of being bold but so respectful using the numbers and then forcing accountability. Make a decision, but just know that if your decision is to devalue me, I don't have that issue.
00:16:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'll move on.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the The one thing about that. So cut my bill in half, my suggestion for how you handle that. I do think you should take another client because I feel like we're right now at that. know, we we felt a recession was going to come and then it was artificially inflated. that's the great vine and you listen to the conversations that are happening. There's a lot of people that are not having money, a lot of coaches, a lot of whatever in the industry. It's definitely not hurting the labor industry. It's so crazy. You still can't get laborers for anything skilled laborers, whether they're fixing cars and mechanics or HVAC or doing nail technicians and hair. Like people are still spending all that money. But in the education world and the coaching world, that's changed. anyway, so that and then I would love to dig into T, what you're doing with Ryan. Oh yeah, the one question I wanted to ask you with. Tom was, have you ever tracked your time and kind of come up with an effective hourly rate for you? And what I would like you to do is if you do that three thousand dollars, if you can create it so that you're spending less time and that you maintain a similar effective hourly rate to what you were doing at five thousand, because you modified your scope, then you should be able to be okay with that too, because three thousand is nothing to sneeze at, if you work well together, then that could grow. And if you're not, if it's not costing you more time, like if you're, you know what I mean, if you're correlating that correctly, then then there's no reason to not do it.
00:18:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that kind of, I haven't done effective hourly rate, but I have, I did just look at like, all right, what is, Because I had to, you know, my days are kind of tasks, their tasks are driven. so my mornings are most productive. so I was giving, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning to thinking and working on Tim's stuff. And then I was becoming more, I was keeping more of an eye on the Discord chat. I even got, I put it on my phone and I was getting notifications on my phone. And then I took that off after this 3K because I was like, well, I'm not going to have those dinging me anymore to take up just more of my brain space. But I was kind of thinking that, like, yeah, I could give it 3K. And if I'm earning on what I sell, then then I kind of feel like, you know, a couple hours dedicated in the morning for really four days a week because Fridays I treat little bit differently. But for Monday through Thursday, I have started, I'll spend like no more than 90 minutes on either Saturday or Sunday, sometimes both in the morning after coffee, just, I don't really do coffee work, but I do more like planning and organizing and thinking about the week ahead. So, which I don't mind. doing that. So sometimes Tim is, Tim is definitely in that thinking. But so is Brian and everybody else fits. So I mean, that cadence has been, has been good for me. But that's kind of what I've been thinking is like I'm going to limit it to, you know, like two hours a day. For I have a Monday meeting with him and the team. That's an hour. And then I do a 30 minute call with this girl Amanda, Amanda Dake. don't know if you've ever lost pass with her, but she's another consultant. She's effectively, I guess, his fractional CMO. And she's great. I really like working with her. So that's really like, I'm trying to limit my time and the week for Tim, if the 3K ends up being what sticks, and especially if he, I don't think he's going to balk at the Refshare thing.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... I'm sorry, I only have one, don't know, there's two amount of days I have mutual friends. D-A-K-E. Oh, D-A-K-E?
00:22:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, D-A-K-E. She's got a girl in here.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've seen her face, maybe he's just with the Titan stuff, but we're not connected.
00:22:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Anyway, sorry. Okay. She's really more project management, and she's handling the, like all the hotel stuff for his growth summit, all the negotiations, food, menu, that kind of stuff. But she's got a marketing brain, she's got good ideas too. you.
00:23:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how much time, because I was listening and I feel like you said like 90 minutes a day for him?
00:23:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Two hours a day.
00:23:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two hours a day for 10. So like 10 hours a week.
00:23:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And that was before? Before I was doing more than that, like I would do my creative output for a couple hours a day. And then I was a little more active in the Discord. And I get one off request for help with preexisting copy and that kind of thing. Or if I'm like I would sometimes write scripts for his, it's really his assistant. she's she's the one handling the like the direct messaging in the in the Facebook group. And this is not her not told him that like this is not her skill set. She doesn't. She's not a cell. She's an appointment setter. She's not a sales person like that's that's who he's using. Instead I was writing to help her be more successful which would help ultimately help me be more successful. I was writing scripts for her and I probably still do that on a specific promotion that I was running because I would see that as you know that like her her follow-up matters um when we're we're in a week where we're making an offer.
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doing a quick EHR. affected hourly rate calculation. So we can just, then I'm going to, sorry, bring it only due to things at once. Let me screen share, because this is safe for you as a value calculator that we created to create some like offer calculations. We don't really use it, but can you see? Yeah. And so what do you think you worked before? Like how many hours a week? were talking about it, but I didn't hear it specific.
00:25:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I probably gave him three to four hours a day.
00:25:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A day? So we'll say 3.5 times five days a week, right? safe for some. Okay, three point five times five, so we'll say seventeen point five Well, I gotta bring this down five That's crazy First of all that it's not very much We really should do this for everything And I really think you need to do this because You know, you're more valuable than that. Yeah, way more valuable than that And let's do one more thing earned for The name And So we're gonna call that Yes. Um, Tom, let's do this for a Titan. Let's do this for tea. And let's set a baseline of, well, for sure, you don't make less than that.
00:27:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But then let's start doing these calculations and make sure that that numbers start growing to a minimum of $250 an hour.
00:27:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Because, I mean, when we go do this, when we go start plugging in these numbers. And so let's, we'll do this drag up. Man, you need to use this for your profit partners modified a little bit. I'll put it in my, my stuff that I'm teaching, um, because everybody needs to do this. so you just take it. You could say, you could say you got it from Tina, that'd be nice, you know, but you don't have to. But But give this if you teach people this. Okay, because they need no so so we'll call this a month Jan 2024 and I'll just I don't think it's gonna let me drop. Yeah, okay, so If I did a few of this Let's do this oh I Think if you do if I do it a couple times hold on hold on. I I want to I want to do it myself Chris Let's do 24 and then 03 24 if you if you highlight this three and then go it'll finish it You know sometimes you have to train it with a few things because it doesn't have enough, but anyway, okay, so I um and then obviously we don't need these to be so big and no you want to there okay hold on oh tina don't don't watch me don't look at me and i really shouldn't even be doing this yet until i populated this video i want it to be but anyway we drag this out you can put this and anything new and if you go populate this and then do some math um i think that you'll figure out what your target EHR should be and um also kind of your return on investment by the hour for them let's really start digging into what you're earning people versus what you're getting compensated because you have a kind of ambiguous value in your head and their head. And we want to make that crystal clear. So your ambiguous version is you know that you're worth way more. Their ambiguous version is probably the same, but they struck themselves and let them believe that you know that they're justified in this until you do the math. And then you can take yourself off the table and be like at some point, right? Obviously you can't right now, but there's going to come a point. But I can tell you when I did this exercise for the first time, everything changed. I'm like I am making people millions. The first time I did it, I went bankrupt making people millions and that just made me mad. then, you know, still making people millions and getting Trump change for it. And I'm like, I got to change this. And when I, the value that when I really understood my value differently, I held myself differently, I conducted myself differently. And it was off putting to the types of people that would take advantage of me because they just recognized I wasn't the one they were going to be able to manipulate. Because there's lots, most people have really no idea. They have an ambiguous right. But they don't have a crystal clear like, I am 100% worth this. So then what happened is I started attracting people who are like, I want to pay Tina, I want to pay her. Like she's valuable. I want to pay her. You're one of those. And it doesn't even if they can't there's a difference between can't and won't. Yeah, you know, and so you want to be in the trenches for the people that can't but would. I want to be in the trenches with you.
00:32:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I worked for free for a while, right?
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole different level of engagement and even relationship and concern and mutual respect and honor. And people get to prove it by how they show up not what they say to you.
00:32:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, let's you take some time. However long it takes you, I mean, we're not going to talk for a month, but I would love you to fill this out for everything that you're working on. Even do it retroactively for it was Tim that you worked for before, right, for a few months, or maybe that was time. This is Tim now. This is Tim now. Oh, my bad. Okay. These people with their similar names. Okay. Anyway, um, yes. So I think you should go back retroactively to anybody that you consulted with and do. You know, it's not going to be perfect because you don't have a crystal clear memory of what you did, but fall part of the best you can. And and and compare so that when you do future client work and profit partner alignments, you have a real idea of what you've been compensated before and also what you've earned. You're just going to feel different like it's going to be eyes wide open and it may actually create some resentment if this didn't already. But the good news is that is a springboard to the place where you're really happy regardless of how this market is and how many people are suffering. Plenty of people are doing really well and it's because of the people they aligned with. I just did. It was crazy. Biggest deal I've ever done. And it was the easiest thing, really, he had to take, I don't know, two or three weeks to really think about it, but it was $100,000 deal. I've never done that before. And it is almost no work. And but it's because I made him millions. it's a law firm. It's not I am. So that's a big difference. I'm working for like my, the next client was a doctor. And it's like a no brainer for him. And in one session, I got him enough traction and taught him something that I have to do the math. What's 15 times? How much was Yeah, so he's definitely got himself paid for because there was something he he was doing and it stressed him out and he hated doing it, so he just didn't do it, so I showed him how to use AI to take the friction out of it, but also because he's nerdy, it made him excited to kind of game the system. Instead of defeating him, he gained it and I was like, I don't have to work so hard. don't to stress so hard. And he enjoyed teaching the AI model how to work for him. So each one of the reports that he wasn't doing because they were tedious as a doctor. Now, he still has to prove it, right? So it's by copy-teeping versus copy-writing scenario all over again, right? So I got him out of the copy-writing and just into copy-teeping effectively with his reporting. And his manager is so happy because he always drags his feet on this. So in one week, that's how much money he was able to get. at $180,000 that he was dragging his feet on and potentially risking losing that attorney referral source because he drags his feet on it. So I potentially stay 10 just that relationship also, which we can't be quantified right now. It can be, I don't have the data for it, but it's going to be worth millions to him. Easily, it's going to be worth, because that was one month, $180,000. He keeps getting referrals, and they all need more doctors. All the attorneys need more doctors, and they need good, reliable doctors. And he's good and reliable just slow, because he hates doing it. So now, not only does he not have to deal with the stress and the friction of doing it, but he's also not going to deal with the delayed payment, and he's also not going to risk that relationship. my value, and I pointed it out to him, my bill's paid for over and over again, copy work that you did, he gets to use that copy again and again. or versions of it, right? go ahead. So that's the thing. Changing who I worked with because of it and knowing my worth and then just doing the math in front of people and making sure that they pay attention to it. So I don't and you know this because we've been doing it repeatedly. I don't assume my people are doing my math, you know, for themselves. So I make sure they do it and go, okay, you wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had this if we weren't working together. You wouldn't have had that. It isn't about ego stroking, but it's like, we do need to know what it does that makes a difference, like tracking macros. When do you figure out that if you eat more protein, you're not hungry anymore or you sleep better or you don't crash as much? It's not until you really look at the data, but nobody's going to make you look at the data if you don't do it yourself.
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
kind of thing.
00:38:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do this for yourself, get really clear on it and then do it with your people and say, look, this is where we're at. So just so you know, this is what I'm going for. I'm going to take us there. If I'm not compensated appropriately, when we get there, we're going to have a different conversation. I've done that and I've terminated relationships even when I had no other money coming in, Chris. And every time they try to come back and double what they would pay me and I refuse it. No, you had your chance to appreciate it. I'm going somewhere else. So these are hard conversations, but I'll tell you what, when the economy is the way it is, you've got more leverage than you think, if you're willing to pay the price of being bold. But the leverage point is having all the other conversations and potentially taking on more work than you really want to do for a little while, knowing that the deck is shifting. And that's going to be what allows you to walk away from other things and the only new things that you take on be highly leveraged.
00:39:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. mean, I think I've got a moment of, I haven't heard anything back from that conservative group that said they were going to be hard to email copywriters and she's been on vacation, I think she goes back today. I was going to email and check in with them, just see what was going on and then my, I had The CPA I mentioned earlier, I met him through Brian's mastermind and he was in Nashville, took me up to dinner a couple weeks ago. He's a little awkward guy and he does all of his clients are on he just does a subscription with a monthly subscription. I think he's got two different office locations like he's got a house of wine and Las Vegas and he was in for his clients he bought the the white label version of go-high level and he just gave it to them. for free is part of their subscription to him. And I said, were you selling any kind of services or build outs to your clients and go high level? And he said, no, we're just making it available as a bonus. And he said, that something you would want to do? And at dinner that night, I said, well, yeah, that interesting. And we kind of left it at that. And I didn't really pursue it because I'm like, I don't know. This guy, he's I don't know. There's just something a little strange about him, like.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, thanks, I said, you're good, always.
00:41:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. But but I was thinking I was contemplating today is like, we should have reached out to him and see because I mean, it wouldn't and offer like that, like. It wouldn't be at all. As clients, it'd have to be like a specific, you know, nitched client or something that could be replicated, you know, folks in sort of the same industry. So I haven't done anything with that. It's percolating in my head, but you know, like in September, I think I want to do another be a boot camp and in that all, you know, the last one was giving me a 10 grand and we did that one.
00:42:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I hate interrupting, but sometimes I feel like it's probably more effective to do that because I have an intuitive thoughts with the experience and the experience that you have had. I know that your intuition is very good, very, very good. Within the parameters, sometimes the intuition is just a don't do anything and sometimes we can use that just to make a very narrow scope of support contract that serves us and it's temporary. So you don't look at it as any kind of long-term potential but also there are always going to be things that you need to run through the good better best filter. You have X amount of time and high level brain energy to use each month. So to the point of if you say yes to anything this scope needs to be clearly defined, narrow and highly lucrative and highly leveraged and you can make the pitch of here's the offer take it or leave it basically. Now your energy is take it or leave it. The words are not, obviously, but you want to be very clear energetically in your heart that like, you're not attached to it. You don't care if they say yes or no. You don't think about, but I need this money because if you do that, it comes out in your energy. You need to trust that the money will come and you already have your, you've been improving the leverage and efficacy of your efforts in tight. Regardless of the fact that you should be getting more, it's still improving, not very quickly, but it is improving and your attitude and energy about it is making that leverage increase. We have been refining this process more and more and though it is small and not enough, 100%, it's a measurable increase in leverage, which is really important because It's also an increase in the compounding effect, meaning you're spending less time spinning your wheels and reactively responding to what's there in the Titan's world, do you agree with that? Yeah, for sure. so we have to trust that continuing to massage and leverage and refine what is happening there is to your best interest and that that simply takes a matter of time has to, but that we know that it has a return that it continues to improve for you because we've got other resources, other people, I mean, like where we are this year is night and day from where we were last year trying like at this time last year was when we were getting operational help and conversations. got Brian and Carla on to meetings, and you got a couple of different people helping as a result of that work, that, you know what I mean, you were so stressed out about all the emails that were happening and having to do the development work just night and day difference in a year, not night and day difference in the last six months, right? But in the year, which is why I like that as a look back, very significant and it only happened because of you. That would not have happened without you driving. You drove it, you obtained those results. So we got to take that into account. So now, I don't know how much time you have, but I don't have a hard stop.
00:46:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you have a hard stop? Yeah, I got to go pick up Madeline at 2.30.
00:46:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So I can catch up on the fee.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But also, you If you want to have another conversation and I won't change the fact that I'll cut the invoice in hot to really kind of refine what's happening on Titans and help you just get a little bit more clear on what you're doing. I've promised you before and I mean it now, oh, give you more time. I know that you're very capable about doing some things by yourself, but I do also think that the experience that we've had is that I really can help you figure out a way to better leverage your time and I think that it's time sensitive that we have a deeper conversation about what's on the table for you right now so that the next time that three month comes around, it's not so stressful for you. Especially because that's coming around winter, holiday, time, know, I would really like you to be better prepared for that. So, if you want to have another conversation, not next week because it's the first week of school for my girls, but the week after. I would like to have an extra call.
00:48:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Would you be okay with that? Yeah, yeah, that would be great.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. So yeah, let's dive into tea and then we will come back in a couple of weeks and please do feel free to use voice messages or whatever as you're contemplating things. But really, let's set the intention that the next three months, you're not stressed out like this. Let's let's meet that happen. Okay.
00:48:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, Mullen. Yeah, so the, I mean, the tea is steadily moving forward. just been, it's just so slow. Like, and I know that if I was doing this, like, it'd be done and up and running and I think the, well, I'm Today, I'm supposed to get an update from their developer who is connecting ClickBank to ConvertKit. I gave him everything he needed on Friday or Monday of this week, but easy connection. mean, easy for me to say, but I feel like it's easy connection to make. So that buyer is using ConvertKit for the tea company, and so he's like, I'll have an update for you on Wednesday. so sort of my way to see if I can update today. And if I don't, then my message tomorrow is like, let's get on a call. Let's figure out like, why does that It's taken so long. And to figure out what the roadblocks are, hopefully there are no roadblocks I don't know about, that would be not great. And because the product has already been approved, in ClickBank, the sales pages are up. They're just not, it's not live on ClickBank yet. I've got all the initial email. Like everything's sitting there ready to go. And John, I think it's yesterday, John texted me, he's the elder, he's the dad. And I was just apologetic, but it was taken so long. And. So I just, I just don't know why it's taking so long.
00:51:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is not still the server issue?
00:51:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This is not still the server issue. This is like just the crossing teas, dotting eyes, getting all the back and stuff to connect and that's probably not there. I don't know. Let's say it's not their forte. They've got this developer bin who they hand all this tech stuff off to. And so maybe it's just, and I don't know, been under a minimum. And so maybe he's just the hold up and they're not pushing him or he's not the kind of person I would hire or I don't know what it is. But yeah, it's just feeling like this. it's just taking way too long to get this offer up. But it's funny when I think about, then I spent this morning, because I wasn't feeling great this morning, and I had a headache, so I was sitting there thinking and I started making a list of what are my client options and then my brain then goes to, I start thinking about the tea, like, the thing I like about that is it's product-based, it's something that we can build, at the heart, it's really a nutrition company in the health space, which gets me excited about that. And where that can grow, we all have the, we're all thinking, eventually this is something we want to build so that we can sell it. So, but I brought that up because I was like, part of my mind today was like, well, I just started like going down these rabbit trails and Google keyword, was like, what are people searching? And then, like, the quilting niche and what are people searching for and, you know, dog training. I was just like, because I started thinking like, maybe, because I hadn't really, anyway, I was like, maybe I should be open and just kind of spend some time thinking about this and I was like, well, that's kind of what attracts me to the tea. So, I don't really have like an end point in that, it's just where my mind's been today, like I've been looking at that. these different niches and thinking that, well, I did kind of lean on one, you know, the fastest path I need some cash is probably doing some kind of client work, but anyway, I've been kind of, I've been kind of all over the place this morning. Yes, I've been off my game, well, I guess, whatever.
00:54:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, here's what I think. I think there's two things. First of all, I think we have probably about two years, because I think that we finally hit the, what happened in 2006 to 2009. I think that we're, I think we're right around the 2007 kind of numbers. it really tanked in 2008.
00:55:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think we've hit bottom.
00:55:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't think we're at 2008 now, but it started in 2006. People really have focused on 2008, but it started happening in 2006. If I recall correctly, going through all of that, it was shifting then. Anyway, so always be thinking leveraged, and the most leveraged thing that I think that you can do is be a high-paid consultant. Now, why that's leveraged is how much time you spend doing it. You have enough connections, but here's the other thing is, you're in a situation where almost everybody is not highly leveraged, and that's the issue. don't have the kind of money to make you a highly paid consultant. So the way that you could be leveraged is having somebody that you can actually use, who is not as smart as you, might be very good and should be very skilled, but not as smart as you and aware as you in terms of being leveraged. So a lot of the contractors are not making, probably not going to be making the money that they were, because the people they were working for are losing money kind of a fist because they don't manage their business as well, and they don't manage their money well. There is going to be a shortage of client work for those middle level people who are really good at what they do, but who don't have a marketing engine to get them new clients and who are losing clients because their clients can't be. So what I think that, and this is going to be like we've talked about rolling up your sleeves, and you've been there for a while, but It feels different when you have somebody else to riff with and to work with. I think what you should be figuring out is, and to me, I think Chris, one of your most powerful and valuable skills is offer creation. The hook and the offer is high level strategy, but then most people don't have the fulfillment team to write that copy, write the email, write the sales pages, write the follow-up sequences, and that actually is not as valuable, but it is necessary to offer creation. Most people don't have the brain for the offer creation that can write copy pretty well. Okay, and they don't have the co-honies to say, hey, this is what you should be doing, and here's why, and they won't do to do the math, but they can write the persuasive copy. So what I think that you should do, and this will take a little bit of time because you gotta find the right person, but I think that you should focus on a consulting gig that makes you a minimum of $100 to $150 per hour, effective hourly rate based off your number, and that might change after you go plug everything in. And then what you do is you price it accordingly, and then you go hire a copywriter to help create your vision that you copy chief, again, trying to focus on that effective hourly rate, being an increase of what you've already been doing. So that way mentally you're like, yes, I'm working more, but I have raised my value and I can see it. So that level of satisfaction, and basically what you're doing is removing that friction and that resistance that's been stressing you out of I could be doing better. because now you know you are doing better. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I know you got to go, but what I want you to do, and let's revisit this. Again, we don't have to wait until we meet. can have these conversations, okay? Look for some consulting jobs where they need help with offer creation and leveraging their business so that they're not bleeding money and they're getting the most out of what they already have, right? Repurposing things, improving their offers, their leverage. Nobody's talking about leverage, really, you know that. But that's the saving grace for us in these hard times, is leverage. So create leverage, and then you go leverage somebody else's writing skills and ability, or even chat GPT and train it well, but focus on leverage because that's the thing that's going to keep you, especially in this third month. people from stressing out. We need to talk more. You've got a lot on your plate. Use me. This is my genius zone and I want to use it for you. I don't want the third month to be stressful for you. There's no need for it. You've got too much value and too much that you bring to the table to ever feel that again, no matter what the economy is. Okay.
01:00:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right.
01:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I fixed the invoice. don't know if you saw a screen share. I didn't realize I was in paper. I adjusted it. I sent a schedule for it to me in two weeks. Please talk to me more. Let's make sure we get you through and then ready so that the stress month doesn't ever come again. There's no reason for it, Chris. You're very good at what you do. You make money. There is still money out there. We just need to get you correctly aligned and leverage. bridging other people.
01:01:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that makes sense. I'm bored with that.
01:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's all there. You've done we've talked about the community and your network for a long time. You are primed for this. We're just going to need there's going to be one other talent person that we need to figure out. So ponder on that. And we'll we'll find it. But but you're in a good spot. Still, we just need to use it better.
01:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's all. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I mean, it's a it's a better third month than the last third month.
01:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But definitely the next one's going to be better. That's what we're going do. We're going to make the lows higher and the highs higher. That's the improvement. Awesome. Okay, it's always good to talk to you. Let's keep talking.

00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool, so yeah. Oh, last night I threw a bunch in the Instant Pot, so it was brown rice chicken, broccoli, with some cream of chicken, and there's some Montreal chicken seasoning, and then some cheese in it.
00:08:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. Montreal chicken season.
00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at you, Canadian, It's good.
00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sounds fantastic, actually. I normally would make that with the leftover turkey, but we also have mashed potatoes and stuffing left, so we're just having a repeat tonight. But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red. I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

Hello.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. How are you guys saying? Good.
00:00:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Theotic but good. It's pretty much always chaos. I kind of like it that way though. My daughter's got me a hat that says Boss of the Chaos.
00:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're one of those people that tries in chaos?
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Not really but I do take some joy in it from time to time and then I like 15% chaos and the rest of it is recovering from the chaos. But it's like a battery pack for me. I'm just like I don't want people. I don't want people. people. And then I get to my people and I'm like, Oh, like the sun and, and then I go home, I'm like, what did I say? What did I do? I just want to like relax and what to be or read or do like whatever work out. I have to get the physical energy out of me. Where's my Patrick? got my Lorenz. Where's my Patrick? Beyond Tom being anti social. This is not okay. Yeah, he might be on a call. I suppose we could tolerate that.

Well, hopefully that will help. mean, they're powerful. Let's see. Why is my windows not open? she is she mentally coming out of it a little bit? Like, that's a lot to go through again and Yeah.
00:02:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
She's strange.
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Good. Adversity is like that. It doesn't matter what it is. It's always this. It's a fog and it's almost like a echo chamber of misery like this. Give you a ribbon in the house of mirrors.
00:02:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything is reflected back to and it's like nothing else exists. But then you get out of it and you're in the real world again. I feel like adversity can be like that sometimes and trauma can be like that. We're like, everything that's in you is what's reflected back to you constantly. if everything that's in you is hurting. That's, that's all. your experiences and then all of sudden you come out of it and yeah so um what's up Patrick hello how you doing you get to fade on yeah I get it every week yeah what do you think I look like with a fade I'm already annoyed by how short my hair is right now all right okay um wait Lorenz remind me how old your kids are uh fourteen twelve nine and five are they excited for Trunka treating you guys do that well yeah we do Trunka treat then we do the our our neighborhood goes all out on Halloween's and yes my we do it we're doing a chili cook off next Wednesday and my kids are fourteen and seventeen but they're still hooking it up and dressing up and yeah yeah my wife told my fourteen-year-old that he was two
00:04:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
to, uh, to dress up and I was like, don't you dare, right?
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, no, there's, there's no such thing.
00:04:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Maybe this might be the last one for him.
00:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, it wasn't that one. No, it a Viking. I was like, what?
00:04:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last, last year he dressed up as Maverick from Top Gun.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:04:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Got a lot of girls looking out and I'm pretty excited about that.
00:04:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That'd be the cost.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Smooth, right? It has me like, what? That takes that out. That's funny. All right. So anybody been thinking about what we were talking about last week? Do you remember what we were talking about last week? I'm like, you paused Lorenz because it was your idea you brought us a table. Patrick, what were we talking about last week?
00:04:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Using Slack to find a way to organize tasks and checklists for the teams to go through. Only get cases.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So did you happen to have any thoughts about that after the fact?
00:05:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I think it would be helpful, but I would try to keep it as basic as possible. Because I feel like everybody has their own little thing that you can add. If we created an Excel spreadsheet and send it around the firm, I feel like it would just get very, very long as far as what everyone thinks should be on there. But I think a general checklist is good because we just get so many cases, or if somebody needs to step up, maybe they're not used to doing certain roles. And they can just kind of see what needs to be done at a certain stage. Yeah.
00:05:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you to run any thoughts about it since last week?
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so actually Slack does have a function task manager function. That's built-in, it's called lists. And you can use the project manager template. And it allows you to assign tasks to people, track the progress, can be working comments on it. It's pretty neat. I've been using it, rolling it out is going to take a little bit of time just because I have to create a new list, essentially, for each client. And I tried to do it during our review meetings. That's taking a little bit too long to do that, to do that live. So I'm going to make some time, I already scheduled some time during soccer practice on Thursday night to get going on those. But yeah, I agree with Patrick. Pretty simple. Otherwise, it just becomes another Mesh like we had with little I when I first came where every time You know a new a new case came on we have 22 emails and 22 tasks and It's just oh no one looked at him. So and The good thing with that is that you can Schedule tasks out So it's not all due today. It's not like and so And you can Grade the importance of the task so that if they don't get to it they can Get to it tomorrow Good.
00:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I talked to Mark about it and he said that Lidify has workflow automation also and so we are gonna get on a meeting only I'm going to get to be able to be there too and we want to talk to somebody there about slack and see because the remember I told you this is going to be an iterative process. It'll be for the same reason that you talked about Patrick and also Lorenz is that we don't want to create more problems than it solves.
00:08:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
We don't want to create a bottleneck that wasn't there before.
00:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?
00:15:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's good. mean, basically when you do the file review, it's like our list, but you're just doing it kind of in your head or you have something that's basically what you're doing. You're making sure that, you know, based on how long we've had the case, certain things have been done or are pending to be done. So that's what I do. I go through and say, okay, this case, we just got it and so called done, okay, insurance request, liver, insurance, set up a treatment. basically what it's going to be for like the newer cases, middle of the case, usually it's about treatment if they're going to continue or if it's been done and it's a negotiation and I already know about that. And then the really old ones, it's more so usually me just negotiating, it's just taking a while or that's to go to litigation or something. So it's good, I still have to remind the team. Like if I see they haven't been contacted for a while, I'll just send a text message. I'm not like coming, send a task to the team and then wait for them to get it when I'm already in there. I can just send a quick text as the attorney and maybe that'll give the client a little bit more, you know, peace of mind. But it's good. Obviously things fall and get missed but that's why we're doing file reviews. don't think it's an optional task for the attorneys. I think Did we mandatory for everybody to do it? Because these are our cases at the end of the day. I personally like just a piece of mind knowing what's going on with each case.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you feel like you have a better hold on your job and your team since looking at it that way?
00:17:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Looking at it, how?
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see, looking at all the cases with that kind of frequency, looking at it with a list you've come up with knowing that these are all the things that have to happen, and then looking at the timeline of these things happening. So if I understand correctly, the pace for both of you have improved, and that level of detail didn't exist to the way that it does at the moment, even a couple of months ago. Am I right about that?
00:18:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure more so for me because the more experience you get, the quicker you are knowing what needs to be done at a certain stage.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the question is, how do you feel like do you feel like you have a better understanding and grasp of your team, which is basically a business within a business, business? Do you feel like that's improving because of the way that you are forerenzically looking at everything?
00:18:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
If I just think, let's say I didn't do any file reviews, it would probably be a nightmare on these cases because if no one's poking and saying, hey, what's going on with this is likely just going to keep going the way it is, if there hasn't been contact for three months, it's likely going to go on for five months, six months. So, yeah, I think now that, I mean, the team knows, like, I mess up. to lc daily cases hey where's this where's that so they know that it's being monitored i think that's another um kind of like way to remind them to do what they're supposed to do because eventually i'm going to go look and ask them hey what happened here um because you know when i started to mark a screen in my cases that's kind of how he would do it to me so um i was like well let me make sure like knowing somebody's looking over here it's older huh yeah i mean it's for the better right i mean these are all our cases and you know i'm not going to sit here and just delegate tasks and not do anything like so negotiate so well especially not if you want to be topped up right yeah like can't like give up control like i still write my own demands there's a difference between delegation and abdication that's the to you if you fail
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's still on me. I'm coming for you Education so application is I'm giving you all the power and It happens in business all the time. So for like in the world that I have a lot of times I'm working with very small companies. They work from home. They've been multi-million dollar A big deal but marketing is the life and blood of the business if there are no customers. There is no business So it doesn't matter how great your fulfillment is it doesn't matter how great your team is it doesn't matter how great your product is If nobody's buying there is no business if everybody's buying and you suck at fulfillment They're still some business. So What will happen though is a person, you know who's been just exhausted with having to do it all for so long hire some and they're like, oh, you're smart, just do it. Like, I'm throwing money at you, lots and lots of money, do a good job, that's not how that works. Money is not generally enough of a motivator for most people to do excellence. comes intrinsically, it comes internally, it comes from something that drives a person. The person who is driven to excellence will be driven to excellence, even if there's no external reward. That's the thing about intrinsic motivation. They're driven by something inside of them that requires them to show up and be the best they can. They're competing, even if there's no prize for competing and just knowing that they're the best, that intrinsic motivation keeps them going. You know what I'm saying? So when we have teams that we manage, getting somebody to do the job in order to help us reach the goal. whether it's a team goal or the internal goal, but generally it's gonna be an alignment of both, right? You have your own drive. It's probably not everybody else's goal to the level that it is yours to be top part in the company. They might be like, yeah, that sounds cool, but they're probably not thinking about it as much as you're thinking about it. They're probably not hungry for it the way that you're hungry for it, right? get a paycheck, I'm not the attorney. So to give somebody a task and expect them to be thinking about it and prioritize it and organize and structure their day and to be disciplined about it to the level that you would doesn't make any sense. And so you wanna make sure that you don't abdicate, give them full responsibility and ownership over everything. You hope that they will rise to the occasion and you hope that they will want that as much as you do but the reason. ideas people generally don't show up like that. So you do have to always keep your eye on all the things all the time. You are going to be the leader. There will be one leader. Now there can be co-leaders, right? But at the end of the day, only one person is accountable for all things. That will be you, each of you. So looking at that and being able to break it down, Lorenz, how do you feel like your just kind of grasp of things, the traction, how the team is behaving, like just what are what's the thing that you might have observed as we've been going into this? going to keep using the word forensically more because it's, you see, I think of forensics, think of looking at the like the anatomy, what's the makeup, like, what do you call it though? Magnifying the last like really Inspecting every detail rather than you know 30,000 foot view to like microscopic view, right? Um, that's how we've been really digging into stuff. How do you feel like that is having an impact? Um, mentoring day to day operations all that.
00:24:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, uh, You know, I'm the kind of person that's never happy. Uh, I always want more.
00:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Never happy or never satisfied.
00:24:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They're too very different. Never, never satisfied. I always, I always want more, always demand more of myself and my team. But, and so I have to kind of force myself to look at the 10,000 foot view and see which direction we're going. You know, we are going upward. momentum is upward and forwards. And so that's, I like to see that. I like to see that there's improvements every week. It's not, we're not leveling out, we're not plateauing. But yeah, of course I want to speed things up. I want to do more. I want bigger settlements. want to go from 20 demands a month to 40 demands a month. I want to, I want all my clients to, I want to figure out a way for all my clients to do their recommended injections, because that's what's going to help them feel better and get better settlement numbers for them. So I'm always, I'm always looking, I can't, when my wife and I sit down to watch TV at night, I have my laptop on my lap, trying to figure out new solutions and new ways to look at things. So, I don't You got some competitor in you, I see, I see you. I don't really worry about.

What other people are doing because I can't control that but yeah, that's I mean really that's the only competitor you actually have cuz You're the only person that is made with the same skills and the same stuff like Improving and beating your best is I mean like I said, it's it's the only true like experiment Because everything if you're looking at a scientific method right then you isolate the variables that means only one variable is Only one thing is actually variable everything else is fixed So but when you're competing against else there's infinite variables you you can't there's nothing else. So You would be That's anyway, that's it. I gotta capture this real quick. So you need to Need to remember that this report is wrong. It's not gonna work is it? Hold on The average resolution speed by team Is that that? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm an integration, capture, you can see it. There we go. Because I'm looking at this again and it's weird because it has average resolution speed is less than Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. For your team, your average days to close is higher than your average days to resolution, but for everyone else, go away. The average day to close is higher. And wait a you see this? So, like, we were looking at this before. Whatever this is, be the same ratio for everyone, this number, or is it? It is higher. Hold on. There's 64. Okay. Okay. This is the right thing. So, this is total close, and this is resolved. So, this is probably paid, and this is, we came to. It got settled. Resolution's probably settled. All right. That proportion is correct. That's interesting. This disparity is pretty big. It's not a month roughly, not quite a month, but then. The speed to act. actually closed. Now it's only really a week difference. Anyway, these are the targets. So this is last 90 days. Let's do the first quarter. Or for the gimme, let's see, equals last quarter is roughly the last 90 days. I don't want that. We'll just do this here. I feel like that number was higher, so, too many one. All right, Lorenz, keep track of your number and Sam's number, 319, 291, Patrick, keep track of your number. Even though we know that that's skewed and Tyler's number 301. So I'm gonna switch it back to 90 days real quick It's got it Yeah That's weird I would not expect that to go up, but it did for everybody I think In the last 90 days, I wonder how that report pulls data Hmm any thoughts guys Maybe like increasing cases Yeah, that's a significant jump though, so for Lorenz it was 346 versus what? three twenty three nineteen three nineteen so twenty seven days so less than a month but still that's a month and then Samantha's number change to you remember what her the number one I feel like it was like 200 something yeah hers was like two ninety something okay and then Tyler let's go switch that back again one more time and it was this year so let's everything up till now so three nineteen yep and then hers was two ninety one so she's roughly 20 day difference higher which is about what yours is right friends yeah and then Tyler's what was Tyler's is he's went down No, that should probably do. It's just an easy, different window side by side. Real one, watch out, 281. Okay, yeah, so here's one up. Here's one. Oh yeah, he did the opposite. So this actually went down. This is 90 days. Well, and where's the volume?
00:32:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Although I don't think that would be such a bad thing because it's across the board, we're all getting clients to get more procedures than they normally would have before. It will naturally extend the time it takes to resolve.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is definitely true. Do you feel like that's happening?
00:32:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It is for my team. I remember getting like two injections was like, were aired for my case book, but now like happens very frequently.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How about you, Lorenz? Is that happening for you?
00:33:01 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I'm getting good value out of my cases higher higher policy limits the Still struggling with my Hispanic clients, but actually I've been digging down with with Mike and Karen who's kind of a newcomer to the team and We're we parents been able to cases that are in negotiations right now She's been able to convince the clients to go back and do the injection so it can get more value out of the cases Yeah, we've had it for 10 days and she's already been able to change three clients minds a I'm wondering if Jessica just just because he's a little bit more shy and I'm not it's not the right word, but like she's not very like assertive when she's talking to clients. I wonder if she's not able to kind of like make them see the light, make them see that this is in their best interest.
00:34:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and that comes down to training in the same way that it's adjacent anyway to the same kind of conversation you had with Viri helping her to feel more confident and open up to you.
00:34:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just kind of interesting because Jessica used to be kind of the superstar on the team. She used to be like the the CM where you know she just runs with it and now I'm like okay I think we have to do a little bit a little bit of retraining because it's kind of throwing me off a little bit and management.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is so important, because again, human resources, things happen. People can go through traumatic experiences that can shake them. They could just have a really bad experience with a call. They can become apathetic. There's multiple reasons why somebody would pull back professionally or professionally in certain arenas. And so these are things that you want to try to discover in your monthly meetings with your team. You're one on one, right, where you can dig a little bit deeper. But also you always want to be paying attention to what people are talking about. You want to be paying attention to their tone and to their body language and be aware of what kind of day you're having. Mark, when we're on our calls, it's almost never on video. I can tell instantly what kind of day he's having, by the way that he says hello. Not everybody is going to pick up all those things. That is a particular skill set. But just being intentional about watching and observing how your team is doing is going to be helpful and impactful. The other thing is training, but knowing that you're watching things, knowing that you're measuring things, all of these things have an impact on how people perform as well as things that are happening in their outside lives, you know, at home and other things that they're going through. So even though traumatic things can happen, difficult things can happen, sometimes even mental disorders and struggles, just anxiety. to me, it's odd to call that disorder because that's just life for the majority of people. And whether or not debilitating, still can feel like disability. and disorder, you know, makes it seem like it's a disability, whereas reduced is all it takes to create a quality of life issue and a satisfaction issue and stress and not being able to sleep, which then has a compounding effect of all the problems because we're not sleeping good. It's so easy for like everything is related, you know, so as you're observing these things and looking at who's doing what and how and you might notice in this contrast that this person used to do better, used to do worse, whatever, you just want to address that as as a leader, as a manager, but more specifically as a leader, managers, know, manage, leaving is a whole different kind of thing. It's being interested in in the person and caring about the outcome for the company, but also for the person. anyway, I would love every week if you guys are noticing things, you know, about about your teams, about performance, bring that stuff so you can kind of brainstorm about it. what now that you have this awareness, Lorenz, what is your timeline? is your plan for doing something about what you've observed?
00:38:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, well, I've got a couple of things cooking. Number one, Jessica was she was preparing and playing her own wedding for the last couple of months. And so she just got back, she took two weeks to go on her honeymoon and she just got back yesterday. So I'm gonna, you know, kind of meet with her probably at the end of the week to kind of see how she's done, how she's doing. The second thing is, I'm gonna be, as soon as John is going on a paternity leave, well, any day now, whenever the baby comes. And so that's gonna be for two weeks, so she's gonna be subbing in for John as a CM. when John comes back, I'm gonna put her back in with Jessica. Heron is a very experienced CM. She did nine errors at Sweet James. And she knows her stuff really, really well. And so she can help, she already helped. She helped me go through Jessica's cases and kind of bring them up to date. And she's gonna help Jessica shoulder some of the load and get her back on track if there's any burnout or anything like that. Trying to get her, you know, I think it's... If there is burnout, if this is a burnout situation, it might be good to like give her a little bit more, give her some confidence by offering some help from an experienced CM who can shoulder some of that load that she might feel overwhelmed by.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that awareness. So I have lots of different thoughts about that. The first thing I'll say is that it's important to be aware when somebody shifts into a box ticking scenario, okay? Box ticking is, I did it, right? It's not how good I did it, how well I did it, it's just I did it. So somebody went through a divorce on the team and was definitely not showing up for a while and the numbers were showing on that team for a while and then all of a sudden that person noticed the dip in the paycheck and they're like, I got to fix this. There are different things that people can be aware of when they're going through stuff. So again, human resources, some of it has to be tolerated, but not without effort. So you can know that you're going to give somebody space for what they're going through in their life, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them up to be aware of the fact that they're not operating at the same level. So one of the things that you can do is be like, when you're here, I need you to be here. That doesn't mean you're not still giving them space for the fact that they may not be able to be fully there. So it's almost that you're doing two things that are at odds with each other. It's not. It's that you're doing your best. to pull them up in the middle of what they're going through, but knowing that it's a request, it's not a demand and a punishment. So the approach is what makes the difference. So sometimes we simply just need to be conscious of the fact that we're not being present and be told that we need to be present. Sometimes really that's all it takes. You'd be like, Jessica, you know, we really should be pushing for this. You used to do that, you're not doing it. I know that you're getting married. know your best stuff in your mind. While you're on these types of phone calls, can you try to be conscious of not taking the box and just being like, I had this call, but make that call be what it's supposed to be. And knowing that that phone call is actually the outcome of the case and how much we get paid, which is the whole purpose of this business, but also it's your job. for that person to make sure that they're getting the best care and the most care that they need to because once the case is closed even if they have any residual issues they're probably not getting taken care of and now it's out of pocket so you have duty to that person sometimes just helping people be aware like hey we're slipping a little bit I know you got stuff going on but I need you to try to do better that's different than you're slipping fix it or else you know what I mean you're still giving them space for being human and also saying do be conscious and try so just keep that tuck that under your hat the other thing is burnout okay so once you get to burnout burnout can be very difficult to recover from it's different for everybody so the first thing that you try to do is proactively avoid it one of those things is really about how we spend our time during the day. I think I talked to you guys about energy services, right? Right, doing the hard things, doing the good thing, doing the good things, hard things, the good things, right? So that's one of the things to being able to talk to people about how they manage their energy and making sure that your team members are energy conscious, right? Because so many of us have, we have people in our lives that are energy vampires, we have things in our lives that are energy vampires, they just drain us, right? But if we're on autopilot, which when people are stressed out and overwhelmed, autopilot kind of kicks in, there's actually a psychological term for it. And it's like called default, default system, I can't remember what it's called Lawrence, you started study psychology, didn't you?
00:44:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, like 20 years ago.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the auto-pilot machine psychology, automatic processing? Yeah, automatic processing. rushing a T-thread. it's like, have you ever just, like, faded out and you're like, I don't even know what just happened over the last five minutes because you were zoning out, but you actually were doing something, you can be driving. That's called automatic processing, what most of us would refer to as auto-pilot. It can happen. A person can be on a call talking to a client and be in the automatic processing mode because they're not being conscious about what they're doing. So, when they're overwhelmed and stressed, that is what happened. It's kind of a defense mechanism also to deal with stress and anxiety and overwhelm. But it also happens when we're doing things monotonously. So, if you are not, this comes back to the motivation and the entrance. motivation. If when you show up, you're like, I got things to accomplish. I'm not just taking boxes, but like, I'm trying to be top dog around here. I'm trying to not get fired. I'm trying to not be stressed out. I'm trying to whatever it is, right? There's something driving you that is important that you're thinking about, not just like, this is the next task I got to do. Okay, did that? You know what I mean? So you'll be able to observe that you may go through those things. I'm sure you do. We all do it at some point. And your people will go through it. But just because it's the inclination doesn't need to mean that it's what actually is allowed to happen. So like, so I noticed, it kind of feels like you're taking boxes. And I know you're going through up but can we try to do better? Here is how you could do better. Don't have somebody to do better who's stressed out and overwhelmed and not give them a way to do it because if they're stressed out and overwhelmed, the mental load is what's overwhelming them as much as the physical load. So if you're asking them to try to figure out how to fix things when they're like, I'm mush, planning a wedding, going through divorce, somebody in the family being in a wreck, your brain shuts down and so even the thing that you used to be able to do on autopilot can be difficult. Your job as a leader first of all is to manage your energy the best that you can to manage your your mentality the best that you can and then to check your people and look at them and like how are they doing? How do they feel? Like what's their mood? Like get a read on them, look at their stuff. Are they On autopilot are they taking boxes or they is something meaningful to them? You know I'm saying That makes sense you guys so That is kind of that that is that is the reward of going through everything Forensics is your level of awareness becomes greater. So imagine that You're going into class for the first time and you remember those like times Like multiplication test that you would get they give you a sheet of all these different multiplication things And you and they were timed and you had to get as many down as you could before the time was up you guys both had that experience Okay At the beginning of the year and the end of the year what was the difference between those?
00:48:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
All right speed speed but also stress, right?
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, the first time you looked at that, palm sweating, mom spaghetti.
00:49:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just kidding.
00:49:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're exciting.
00:49:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It's like a challenge.
00:49:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. anxiety. Like, holy crap. Okay. So what's the difference at the end is experience, but it's also awareness, because what you went through that year was you learned the times tables. You learned one through 10, 11, 12, probably, and you memorize them so that the mental load was diminished because it was wrote practice. You did it on repeat so much that you didn't have to think about it. You just knew what to do. But you were thinking about it every time you went to class, you were practicing it, and you were thinking about it so much that it just became easy. So what you're doing right now is you're basically learning the times tables of your business. right? You came into it and you're looking at it and there's this overwhelm and like I got all the stuff to do. How am I going to get it done? Well, stress, anxiety, and then the end of the year is going to come where you've been like looking at one through one times two, two times three, nine times nine, eleven times eleven, all these things show up and you're like, well, I know how to solve that. I know how to make that better. I know that's going wrong. I know who's dropping the ball there. I know how to fix the fact that they're dropping the ball there. Your level of awareness has just increased exponentially. So your ability to get the work done, the same exact work at the beginning of the year versus the end of the year, right? A sheet full of all these multiplication problems and you're going to get through the end of the year and be like, I got this. My team's got this. That's what we're doing right now. So, but it doesn't happen overnight. You know, some people did really well with maybe the twos and the fours, but not so good with the sevens, right? There will be those aspects in your business, where you're like, okay, I got intro calls, but I've got distributions, where are my sevens? You know what I mean? Like, there's different aspects, your teammates are going to have different things over different types of things. But because you're looking at it, top to bottom, left to right,,000 foot, you down to the microscopic view, and because you're taking accountability and ownership and leadership, not just over the results of the business and the company, but over your people, you guys are going to get some amazing results, but you have to, once you get that awareness, you have to go solve the problem. So if you see somebody slipping, whether it be yourself or somebody else, You have to address it, and you have to teach the solution. Don't just go say fix this, do better. Let me give you some ideas and suggestions about how you could do it better. also before you even do that, ask questions. Anything going on that I'm not aware of? Because I noticed this, and I think that you're this kind of quality person. And you've had this kind of quality work, but you work. Right now it was not up to what I know you can do or have done in the past. first of all, what's going on? Is there anything you want to talk about? Anything I can help you with? And whether they do or not, at the end of the day regardless, we still have to do better because this business requires it. This is what the job is, and the job is a privilege. It is not an entitled thing, right? to earn the job to get it. You got to earn the job to keep it. So here's how you could do this and always put an emphasis on this probably be the process that will take the least amount of mental effort. Like always look for the optimized version of how they can do better without being so stressed out. So that's where our automations and workflow come in. That's where the checklist comes in and really like hey if you are struggling to even figure out like what should I be doing today which by the way guys know I was talking about earlier a quick and dirty version until we get to the automations workflow. I cannot think of a better solution. Feel free to tell me if you have better idea. But I think just a spreadsheet where we have so let me go through this real quick and it would be a big old spreadsheet and it could take a long time to go through so I don't know that maybe it's one sheet, maybe it's multiple sheets and you go by the status that the case is in, right, like the first I feel like it's roughly three months months where there's like the most of the flurry and then there's you know they're going through treatment and so we're not closed yet and then there's closed end to resolution where we're waiting for the payment. So maybe we have a tab for or open and active and then we have a tab for in treatment and then we have a tab for close but not settled or wait settled but not closed but what I think would be awesome is if we had a spreadsheet for each of you and here's all the things right and instead of who does this there's a checkbox or a status of like whether it's being done now I know you have litify and you can go through all of that here's the difference and so like I'll give you example and litify I've got reports and one of the ports gives me all the data that I want, but the way that it's laid out is linear and I can't wrap my head around the 30,000 foot view, which is what I really, really need. And so we put that into bar charts, graphs, pie charts, things like that, and in charts, so I can see what I need to see. The information is there, but if I can't mentally process it because of the way that it's laid out, if I can't process it like this, if I have to look at it, every time I have to look at it, I have to do some calculations. It's not laid out in the best way possible. So all of this is already laid out and litified. But if you can't go, scatter it and be like, very quickly, this was the last day that was touched, and this is the phase that it's in, and that lines up with what I know it should be, which you cannot do and let it by right now very well, I think. Do you think I'm wrong? Do you think you can do this and let it by well? you guys do it day to day so I sort them by category okay the case status I feel like yeah I think you can actually because I don't want to create more work but what I want to make sure that we're doing is really being able to as quickly as possible and and I feel like being able to just look at it room across the board like on track off track kind of thing which also that's something that I want to identify people about it with the workflow automations on track off track if we can have a red toggle button or green toggle button like you know Excel has conditional formatting where like if a number falls between a certain amount it'll turn red like it's a negative number You know what I'm talking about Lawrence? Okay, so like, what if let if I had this condition to where basically, let's say the last comment was longer than a week ago, red flag. So all you're doing now is looking for red or a particular status. That would be really helpful too. I want to make sure I make a note for myself to talk to a little bit about that, to see if we can have an on track, off track, on on pace, off pace, and maybe what would be cool too is if each of these could be a sub status. What do you guys think about that? Would that be helpful? But I don't know if it would be because some of them are overlapped. So maybe we punk them into groups, the ones that overlap. This. is where this kind of thinking guys is where we create the system that doesn't create more work. So really thinking about what that structure could look like, where it doesn't create more work. That takes a lot of mental effort, but it will save it in the end and it will keep us from overwhelming everybody while we're trying to figure out the system. The other thing that I'm working with, founders and CEOs. quite often we have seven and even eight bigger businesses with teams of just five. If somebody, this is phrase and one of my mentors gave me was like, happens if you get hit by a bus tomorrow? I'm like, that's terrible. I just got a shock at myself. Just even thinking about that. But when you think about the impact to the business, it's significant. For now, imagine it's you, like something happens to you and you are unable to do your job for weeks at a time, for some reason, um, you're going to have if you're conscious, you're going to have anxiety be able about what's happening. If your system is so tight that another attorney can come in and if you guys are following a relatively similar system, another attorney and your case managers, and honestly for the most part, the case managers and the assistant should be able to do pretty much everything. The biggest issue is that attorneys have liability and so you you perform at a higher level. We've had this conversation before, right? You are liable to the state, to the government for the actions that happen. Your case managers legally and your assistant legally are not liable for anything that happens in the case. have to like actually break a law. But you in terms of like just obeying the law and being compliant, you have liability. So anyway, not everybody can do everything, but for the most part, because you're pre-lit, most of this can be done by anybody else. So let's say one of you gets hit by a bus or one of your team members get hit by a bus. If running this system is so well documented and organized, and you can see where everything is at, at all times, and you know where it's at, and also you're following the same type of system to know where everything's at. God forbid anything bad happens to somebody, but life happens. Somebody else would be able to step in and go like, I know exactly where we're at, and we can all handle it. Imagine the piece that will give the person who's not able to work for a while, as well as everybody that has to work. Now nobody wants to think in such morbid terms, but... it's reality as things happen. I mean, we went through a pandemic, the whole world shut down and changed the way that it operated. This type of structure, anything that was structured like this was barely phased. So keep that in mind, we're over time, and I yacked your ears off already, you're probably like bleeding on the inside, like, okay, already, Tina, the same as alone, but whatever. I ain't apologize. I appreciate you, Tina. I love you, quiet guys. You don't have to be so quiet, but keep working on it. Keep thinking about it and bring your ideas. I don't really have any ways how you could use these processes and Or if you look at it and go, know, it would be great if I could do this, but I don't know how I could do that. Because I am going to, we are going to have that meeting. I would love to take your feature requests or functionality requests. So maybe it does exist and we just don't know how to use it to that conversation. And please be thinking about how we can use the tools that we have to go from, if we could zoom in and out from 30,000 foot view to the microscopic view, you would have a full understanding of everything all the time and the more that you understand it, the better you can manage it. And also the better that you can teach your people to use it, right? So just be thinking about what kind of structure and functions in your tools would help you to manage it more efficiently. and help your team to manage it more efficiently and bring any ideas to the table. Other than that, just keep doing the best you can and think about the kind of leader that you want to be and notice your people and take good care of them.

Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.
00:01:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.
00:29:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We have it. It's a. a lot lazza roll or something like that it's It just mellows around we would do it around if there's gonna be fireworks Cuz she gets real nervous with that, but Yeah, we gave her a pill If you find out what the details are and let me know cuz I have a dog that cries every time he gets in the car drives me Bonkers bonkers.
01:13:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I will let you go. It's so good to catch up with you You just maybe not be such a stranger for a month maybe yeah, no promises You know I wrote on that sheet a couple times couple I saw once I Know once this month and it was last week All right, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. too.

How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Hello.
00:00:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hey, Tina.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:10 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Good.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. good. So it'll just be us, not Patrick today, because he's on vacation and he just messaged last night about it.
00:00:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's all you, all the focus on you today.
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Nice. Sorry.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how was it gone since last week? Any thoughts and ponderings about what we talked about before we get to like the tasks and assignments?
00:00:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just kind of went ahead and did it. I met with all my team members one on one.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about that.
00:00:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it went well. Had a. Very well, you know, the whole reason I wanted to do it was to me with a very anyway, but she ended up being sick so I didn't get clearance of this morning It was good I got some good feedback the way I structured it I kind of like Asked them how they were doing and of course they gave me the generic answers, you know pretty good or you know Happy or whatever and then I got a little further asked them what their biggest stress was Right now and I got some good answers and then So usually it was like on the client side and then as I gave it we discussed that different solutions we could come up with and Then asked them, you know, what about the firm from the firm side you're experiencing stresses that I could help you relieve or any anything that we can do. so I got some good feedback on that as well. And then I set some goals with them. I wanted to have three goals for the next month for each one of them. So we set some goals. And then for coaching, I finished with coaching points. I just kind of went through a couple of things I noticed, but it kept it really positive.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would love to do, what I think would be super insightful and helpful, is just to go over those in details for you to share what it was like, what you learned, your read on them, how they felt. Because like I said in the beginning, it's really an information. gathering process. So, basically, imagine you have, have you ever played with Legos? Okay, so you're dumping out all the Legos and you're basically taking inventory, and let's say you're doing something where you're just building it from your mind, not necessarily from a plan or schematic, and so you're figuring out what you've got to work with, so you can kind of build in your mind first, knowing what pieces you're working with. So, you know, some of the pieces are the people, but inside the people, so let's say the people are colors, and one's red, but there's different shapes of red, and one's yellow, but there's different shapes of yellow, and each of the different shapes would be their different skills, talents, abilities, weaknesses, any of those things, right? So, we're really just figuring out what do we have to build with, and it will be the people and all the nuance inside of them, and then it'll also be, obviously, the combination, like, where. not just building a red thing or a yellow thing, but so if we're, you know, we could do that together so that we're leveraging, you know, both of our different skill sets and see what we can come up with. What you think about that?
00:04:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think be great. Yeah, I think initially, you know, I was a safe space. know, I wasn't like evaluating him for their next raise or anything like that.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure.
00:04:39 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But I think, yeah, that's what that's where I want to go. I want to be able to use these one ones as like, you know, a growth audience experience.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like um, very was a little bit more open this time with that intention that you set? Do you feel like she
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
end up at all more than normal. Yeah, a little bit. So, you know, what, it was a little bit different with her because I knew that that was one of the points we have touched on last last time we met. And so I made sure to emphasize the fact that, you know, this is a safe space, you know, I know that, you know, you know, I worked and passed four terms where anytime you were a little bit vulnerable, that was used as to, you know, those weaponized against you, then down the line. And I wanted to make sure I wanted to make clear that this wasn't this. This was just a way for me to, to be in touch with her and understand how I could support her, how I could help her. Set goals and how I could make sure she was happy here. And so you said that explicitly? Yeah.
00:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how did now reading both energy expression and words, how was that received?
00:06:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I could like, I could see her body language, she relaxed a lot more.
00:06:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is way more like, almost like her shoulders when come up here. It's like down here is choosing. You know how big that is for that to happen. So you know what that means is that she trusts you that what you say is true. Yeah, she had an immediate response. What you said she trusted. That's, it's really important for you to understand that, that how to forgive me. Sometimes I get emotional when I think about people and our hearts and our spirits. and the things that we're going through because we are we are people and this is a big deal and our fears are a big deal our traumas are a big deal and they show up everywhere they show up in the workplace so when a person by default does not feel safe for them to come into contact with a person who can tell them they're safe and they believe it that is very powerful and I want you to remember what I told you about how you can be a different person for these people do you remember what I told you about yourself? I remember we talked about how I could be the safest person to these people because you are safe because you are kind because you do care um not Not because you just want to be that way, but I was pointing out to you that you actually are that way. And so what I want to show to you is now you've received a validation that is in Tina's just making an opinion and she doesn't know me, but she's guessing that these things. You just got validation from somebody that you've been working with, because that physical symbol of shoulders dropping and you can see that she relaxed 100% validates what I said is that you are perceived as safe. However, what I want you to also understand is that a lot of times we can do things somewhat obscurely and meaning that it's not crystal clear. Obviously, I know you know what obscure means, but I want to elaborate on my meaning. You can get a sense of something that you haven't dug into. you. So you haven't specifically identified it and brought it into crystal clear view. For example, Viri could may have sensed that you're a safe person, but you didn't give a clear enough signal to her to say, I am a safe person. I want you to feel safe. And so she felt it, but she didn't believe it per se. And generally speaking, we can feel safe around people, not know that they're safe for a very long time. And especially if you have the experience that you have trusted people in the past, and then they haven't been safe, you're going to doubt that your perception is accurate anyway. So she was able to pair her internal and intuitive perception of you being safe with your words confirming it. she believed it immediately. Hence, the physical experience and vision. visual symbol that she had relaxed and leaned into her the little bit. Does that make sense?
00:10:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I want you to understand how powerful that is, because if you know that about yourself, Lorenz, then, but also if you know that there are people like Viri, and there's many, many, many, many, many of them, the majority, who don't feel like people that they are supporting that too in any kind of way are safe, who may not feel like men in the workplace are safe, or any of that, that you can give them a clear signal, I'm safe for you. I want you to feel safe. How you feel is important to me. want you to communicate what you need, what you think, It matters to me. I value your opinion. I value your presence on the team. I value, I mean, it could be your children. It could be other people in other places in your life. But you have because you are kind, because you care, but also because you're intelligent and because you have a good work ethic. That makes you rare. That's not the average person, friends. I've worked with so many people and I was just born weird watching people and intuitively recognizing them. I had grown people speaking to me as a child, forgetting that I was a child, talking to me and unburdening.
00:11:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, I'm not normal either.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I've learned to recognize people and I speak boldly because I'm open to the fact that that I could be wrong, but I haven't been yet, and I won't be surprised when I am, well, I probably will be surprised when I'm wrong, but not because of me, but because of people and because of patterns and because of consistency. People really do give a lot of signals.
00:12:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's just most people aren't looking for them.
00:12:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm always looking for them. That's part of my bad for me, have actually become a superpower, which is actually true for a lot of people.
00:12:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So anyway, that's just all that interesting talking to you because like as an introvert, it's sometimes hard for you to express what I'm thinking, but it sounds like you're kind of like you can kind of interpret it before I can get the right words out.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And it may not surprise you, but that's actually, I think it's probably one of my favorite gifts. And I get told that a lot is that there are things that people think. And they maybe have never even put it towards themselves yet. But I say it and I'm like, Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Or that's what I was feeling or like I had that awareness or whatever. So what you gave to me, even though I've already received it, it always helps me to receive that validation. So what I'd like you to keep in mind too, is that you have the ability to give validation to other people as well. And to take it when you receive it, because that is it's power. It gives people more confidence when they get a clear signal that this is true. So do you re needed that you gave a tour? And she gave you a clear signal of what I told you is that you are uniquely considered safe and trustworthy. So Oh, you told her you were safe because you were already received as trustworthy, she believed it. So those are two signals about yourself that were really important to receive. And I promise you, she's not the only one that thinks that. So that's really important and awesome and good job. Like, I didn't think that would be that fast, but that's how great you are. it does me no good to patronize or placate people. Anyway, if that would be counterproductive, I'd be out of a job very quickly because it'd be the emperor has their clothes.
00:14:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know what I mean?
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So I really, I really am impressed that you were able to have one conversation and watch shoulders drop. That specific signal is really, really potent. Wow, I also couldn't even like apply on the wall and watch that happen. That'd be amazing. Okay, so go ahead.
00:15:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It was pretty, you know, a pre rewarding conversation. think she's, you know, she has so much to bring to the team and I've been frustrated with, you know, not being able to suss that out. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see how she kind of grows and is able to kind of trust me as an attorney and can bring her own input to our team.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I am so excited about that also, but I want to remind you, though, that she will need the consistency. So she'll need those signals again and again and again, because a lot of times people will declare who they are with their words, but it's when they support what they declare through their actions that we really know for sure. And I'm sure that you've already told her, like I said, she probably sensed it. This was just. the confirmation. But my point is that you'll want to reiterate that either explicitly or implicitly in the conversation that you have, even just saying things like, I'm so glad that we're opening up a little bit more and talking because I value what you say, just moving right along. not having to make a big thing about it, but a tiny little signal that I met what I said, this is on my mind, this is real, you know, let's keep going. And when she does say something, and it was, you know, more than what you would have expected before, I was just like, wow, I'm so glad that you're sharing more because I really feel like I'm, you know, from your mind and your experience. And, you know, just little signals like that, sincere, obviously, but I know that they will be. So then not only will she just continually be open but that should probably spread to other so if anybody else is needing anything and you say hey guys I need you to open up more a little bit and maybe Viri speaks up and goes yeah I did and it was awesome you know yeah super excited about this you're awesome good job good job good job and you just got right on it I love that and I love that you're all stealthy like I'm gonna talk to Viri but I don't want her to feel worried so I'm gonna talk to everybody well yeah I think you know the other interviews were good in their own rights for different reasons but Viri was the principal target yeah yeah but but you put in the effort to go through the whole thing first of all to consider and to not want to make her afraid and so to take time to talk to everybody which obviously is a benefit and wisdom anyway but that's the difference between bosses and leaders Lorenz and you just do it it because you're like, well, of course, duh, like, what else am I going to do? But, but I want you to understand that is not how most people operate. And it, it's what makes you really great and why people feel safe is because you default to that into caring and concerning about people. And they're like, what is this? That's not, that's not how people normally are. So good job.
00:18:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
job. Thank you. Thank you.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Making me blush a little bit. Well, I am sincere.
00:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I promise you.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Okay. So did we learn anything? Did she share anything with you that that we can use?
00:18:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you have any coaching points? Let's get into the nitty-gritty of everyone. Yeah. So I guess that's where I'm very, let's talk about her. Okay. So generally, she's very happy. She's, she's, I think she was, she, she explained to me that, Initially, she was a little bit, she didn't know how to fit into the sweet lawyer's system because she came from a place where all the jobs were very segregated. so she would only do one type of task. Whereas here, it's kind of like all hands on deck. She likes that she's finding her way through that and that she's getting to a point where she's able to feel helpful, especially at the end of the mountain, things like that. And she likes that she's growing a lot faster than she expected.
00:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's living a lot quicker than she expected. I love that.
00:19:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
One of the stress points right now is she wishes she had more time. She asked her, do you feel like you have too many cases that you're too many tasks for the cases that you and John had. And she says, not necessarily, I just wish that there is a way for me to come in earlier in the morning. So like once we get, I can get some of those tasks done before we get phone calls raining in. And she said, well, I might look into some daycare for my kids, my younger kids that don't have school so that I can come in earlier and told her, know, she needs to stay later, that's fine too, know, she doesn't have to work around her schedule within reason. And then we talked, but I do think like it's also, this might be a product of, well, she's still fairly new, she's still learning quite a few new tasks. And I think some things will get quicker as she gets more experience with them. I'm also thinking about talking to John about making sure he doesn't all flow too much to her. Then, you know, we had a conversation a little hard to hard about, you know, like this is not a place where she needs to be on guard all the time, she can make mistakes and we'll work on them to get others, this is a safe place to be, know, she doesn't need to look for perfection. And we set some goals, I told her, you know, she had a hard time setting goals, and so we kind of looked at certain things together. I looked at the cases from her and John and they have, there's too many cases in collecting meds right now, collecting med status. So I asked her what would be a good goal for, to move cases from collecting meds to ready for demand and she set a goal for it to do 20 cases by next month. I think it's a little bit ambitious, I'm honest, but I don't want to, she wants to do 20, I'm not going to like tell her it's too, too many. Right.
00:22:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So elaborate on that for a little bit, did you say collecting meds to ready for demands?
00:22:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:22:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And like meds being like medical like reports and doctors and medical records and billing. Medical records and billing.
00:22:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Kind of the biggest bottleneck in my case.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Now. And her goal was to do what? To get 20.
00:23:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
In what time period 30 days, so we said goals for 30 days. I think 20 I say she gets to between 10 and 15.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that would be very impressive. Where is she out right now?
00:23:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I don't have any prior data, but I know on average that's about how much people are able to get because there's so many things outside of your control zone. If the hospital says we'll get to it when we get to it, apart from following up every other day, there's not much you can do to hurry that along.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm wondering, so I talked to you in Samantha that one time and we talked a little bit about tracking time and she was definitely not interested in it and everybody operates differently. That's okay. This isn't that. picking lots of other things. But what I will tell you, is I haven't even marked it this exercise, although he pushed off on it for a long time first. But imagine that our time is, so imagine we're a store, and the store operates, and it has a certain amount of stuff that it can sell and make money with, right? There's this fixed, that's your inventory. Well, your business is the tasks that you do. It's rather than items on a shelf. It's the supply is your time, and the things that have to get done. And you have a certain amount of hours to work with. And that's it. So by tracking time, if we were to track everybody's time for a couple of weeks, this has nothing to do with micromanagement. This has to do with finding out what Legos are in the back. That's all it is. It's understanding where things are. are going, how long it takes, and looking at it and zooming out and going. I wonder what would happen if we changed the order of operations. I wonder what would happen if we changed who's doing what or when, but until we don't even know what questions to ask about how we can do it better, until we break down how everybody is spending their time. And if they're not afraid to share it, if they're not afraid to really track it. So for example, you've got Mike, Mike, we know Mike is late, we know Mike takes longer breaks, but we also know that Mike is bomb at getting just distributions, and that he likes doing it, and it doesn't stress him out. And so, you know, imagine everybody's a stick, and on one end there's a poopy side, and on one side there's gold, and you have the gold. but the only way to get the gold is to pick up the poop, like that's how people are. We've got the good, we've got the bad, you get both. You can't separate them, you can't cherry pick what's good about people and refuse to accept what's bad at them. most of the time, our strengths are actually the same things as our weaknesses apply differently. So for example, I'm very bold. I will say what's on my mind, I will step up and get things done, I will just do it. I have this like bull energy and it makes amazing progress. And my brain is powerful and I'm able to think about so many different things and so I can run several different things and several different projects faster and better than the average person is. But that's the strength part of it. When I talk, my brain goes ding, ding, ding, all over the place and people who are not like ADHD cannot follow it and it annoys them and it frustrates them and stresses them out. And when somebody repeats themselves even once, like I heard you the first time, I understood you the first time, you are annoying my brain when you repeat yourself. So now I'm annoyed and that's frustrating them because they're like, well, I need to process things this way. And so to them, it's a perceived weakness. Also, the strength of my energy, some people find incredibly intimidating when it's directed at them, even though it's not directed at them, right? It's just the conversation that we're having. So they hate it when it's pointed at them, but they love it when it's pointed at anybody else on their behalf. But they want to make me wrong for when it's pointed at them. And I'm right and wonderful when it's pointed at anybody else for them. Now, I'm not being any different. I'm being me the same all the time. they're deciding if it's right or wrong or good or bad and they don't get to. Does that make sense? So, you know, Mike, his nonchalance is what makes him so good at distributions because he doesn't care. He does, he does the job, he does it well, but he doesn't care what people think about it. That is exactly the same reason he can roll in late and take long lunches because either you're going to take it or leave it, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do. They are exactly the same qualities. One has a positive effect that we really enjoy. One could be considered non-professional and annoying, but you don't get to pick and choose how it shows up or you do, but if you get rid of him because you don't like how it shows up in his time behavior. here, then you lose the power of how it shows up in this conversation with clients. You pick up under the sticks, you either take the stick or you don't, but you get both sides.
00:29:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we need to know what's on the stick. And we need to know what it's doing every day. And we need to know, so let's say I don't know, like, what are the things that everyone's good at? is there something if we do some time tracking, and we say, this person and this person both have, you know, similar tasks to do, but this person does this type of task super fast, like we're looking at it and they spend two hours a week doing it.
00:29:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
this person spends 10 hours a week doing it. Not me. I mean, I remember last year when we discussed it, I initially was kind of on board with it, and I presented it to the team. Usually the team is like, you know, whoever Lauren says, we'll do it, know, they're pretty well liked.
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
likes this task.
00:30:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But this was like unanimously rejected, all hated it.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think it's because of fear because nobody wants the microscope on them. That is the thing that most people, when I get into teams, they're afraid of it. They're afraid of being inspected closely. But if we can help them understand, it isn't about them and it isn't about looking for flaws. It's about looking for levers, opportunities to find the sunspots and what's different.
00:30:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
it's in take.
00:30:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I believe my audible, but I might have read it like a few years ago.
00:31:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I would like you to read it. So there's one story where there, I don't remember where it was. I feel like it was an Asian, like an impoverished Asian population, where basically everybody was suffering from malnourishment. And but they found this one area, this one village, where the children were thriving. And they're like, and so, okay, so this, this group of people, I'm probably gonna butcher this because it has been like 10 years since I've read the book. But they were tasked with going to helping improve nutrition for an area. They had like six months and almost no money basically. They had like no way to overhaul nutrition because there was not enough money and not enough time. But when they did, down there and they dumped at the Legos basically and they looked at everything and they like what is different. So every single population they were malnourished the children were skinny they were sick they were weak except for this one village and the difference was that the mothers so they while they were working and they started adding the shrimp into the rice and that extra protein and nourishment completely changed the way that they they were they were healthy they were strong they were thriving so that was available to all of the rest of the communities they didn't have to re-educate them they didn't have to get a program going they didn't have to bring new food in they didn't have to change changed the food chain supply at all. It already existed. They just needed to change the way that they behaved, which is utilizing a resource that was already existing and adding it to their meals.
00:33:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, you know, I'm a, you know, my background, I did a psychology in college, but not like, my whole thing was numbers and statistics.
00:33:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
loved it.
00:33:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. So, I understand the value of the proposition, but I'm wondering if there's an alternative way to get the same results with that.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what I'm going to tell you. I don't. I'm not a fan of interrupting, but I'm going to because this is the leadership job. Sometimes you need to convince people that they need to do the hard thing. Your job is to motivate the troops and say, we need this data. so that you can enjoy your job better. There is something here, like go read that book, go get the study, go see if you can find a parallel study so that you have enough ammunition to explain to them. I have no interest in micromanaging you. I have no interest in picking apart how you're spending your time other than going, is there a way we can build a better mouse trap? How can I help you, like what are the things that you could, do I need to train you better? Maybe I can take something off your plate and shift it to somebody else who enjoys it more and does really well and give you more of what you like. I don't know, but until we break everything down and take inventory, we don't actually know exactly what we're working with. And I want you to care enough about your career. And I want you to have enough trust in me as a leader to say that if we gather this data together, we can look getting go huh what we're doing the best we can okay great job but I've never gone through this exercise with any company over 22 years in any industry where we didn't go whoa I didn't know that what if and then we make a slight alteration and there's improvement but what is requisite first is a willingness to get the information now either these are people who are willing to be a little bit vulnerable and invest in tracking this time or they're not but so let me give you one more motivator that you may not want to use but you can and you should you're spending extra time once a week meeting with me trying to figure out how you can be better for them you take out out of your own pocket your incentive pay to give to the team. You're investing in leadership and improvement. The least that they could do is track their time for two weeks. Because you want to know, look, are you here to collect a paycheck or are you here to be part of a team and be the best part of the team that you could be? If you're here to collect a paycheck, you're probably not going to last a long time. Because you're going to be at this for a couple more decades probably before you retire, right?
00:36:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, the fire retire.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Right. This world is not getting cheaper. So don't you think you have the best odds of being successful at it and being like minimizing stress and actually enjoying your life and enjoying your job if you're surrounded by people who are invested and being the best that they can be like you are?
00:36:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I feel like I am right now. I think all four of them are pretty invested in what they're doing, which is why I appreciate them so much.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks of time tracking, like what's their biggest issue?
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
know this is like, I know you're probably going to say no, but Can I just ask them, okay, you don't need to give me your exact times, but you need to give me a percentage for each task, the percentage of the total time for that day for each task.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me tell you why that doesn't work. They will guess if they're not writing down the times.
00:37:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, in other words, they would write down the time, but not having to share with me the exacts.
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Okay, are they not getting paid hourly? Yeah, okay. Is there any reason why it's unreasonable to be held accountable for where your time goes when you're getting paid hourly. But the motive, that's the thing. That's your job as a leader to help them to believe and understand. you could tell them, look, I'm, if I wanted to be a jerk about it, my rights to say, look, you're paid hourly. This, this is, you know, a time report. Um, you know, I say do it, do it. But that's not why we're doing it. This is short term. This isn't going to be something that keeps coming up. It's not about micromanaging because it's not necessary. Micromanaging is counterproductive because you want autonomous people who are going to problem solves themselves. you need to tell them that also. Okay. But what this is, is a leadership effort on your part to figure out what. the pieces are and is there any kind of, okay, so for example, vieri came from a place where the tasks were segmented? Is the way that we're doing it better? How do we know? Let's take a look at what's happening and how it's going and how everybody on the team is performing and just see if we can do something like, do you guys not care enough to be willing just for two weeks, track your time? You can track your time too and you can report it and you can say, hey, I'll report to you, I don't have to, but I'm going to. Lead by example, if you want to, there's all kinds of ways to go about it, but at the end of the day, the more information that we have, the better we can lead and support and encourage and ask them to, like, are you going to be here for a year? Are you going to be here five years, 10 years, 15, 20 years? Do you want to be in an environment that is optimized for you to be able to spend your time doing the things that you enjoy the most or that you're the best at? and being surrounded by people who are being able to. I don't know, like do you wanna, how much joy do you wanna have out of it? Do you wanna come in and just drudge through it? Because what we're doing today, we don't get to keep doing. Like if you're not, we're always moving, we're either moving forward or moving backwards. There is no static, there is no being stagnant. And the market keeps changing. And there will be somebody better coming up. Like if you want to create the environment where you don't have to keep going and looking for another job and new people to work with, then we have to make the most out of what we have here. But in order to do that, we need to analyze it. And we need to not be afraid of analyzing it, which means they need to trust you that you're not there to pick things apart and break it, but you're there to look at it and go, how can we make it better? how can I support you? And either they believe you or they do. don't and either they're willing to do the extra work or they're not. They can grab about it. They don't have to love it. Nobody has to love it. And I would encourage that you don't grab about it because that doesn't support anything and that's negative and it perpetuates negative energy. You can complain once. can say, I don't like it once, once. Other than that, you become a complainer and that's an issue and the culture should be, because we talked about culture last week, we're not here to be a complainer. We're here to make the best out if we can. So that's it. It's a long conversation sometimes. It's a short conversation, but it's your job as a leader to try it now. Now, you don't believe in it, sorry my dogs are going nuts, then that's a whole other issue. So let's start there. Do you think that there's value in understanding how long it takes people to do tasks and how long they spend on it and seeing if there's any kind of patterns that evolve? okay data is my safety blanket right you like you just said like that's what you were looking at was numbers so this should make perfect sense to you so i need you to dig deep and explain to them why you love numbers and to me this is what i tell people all the time numbers tell the truth numbers don't have emotions right so if i go and i look and and very takes um 10 hours a week or 15 hours a week for for just collecting medical records and she's only getting five cases and i don't remember the other person who's equivalent on your team i have to go look at the numbers the spreadsheet hold on mike that would be mike right well they don't work out that way or maybe they did anyway it's not a perfect analog because it's a little bit differently on the other team but right so but anyway comparing what you can and going you know this takes you a lot longer but but for example it's Is there anything that Mike can do to help Viri or I don't know who else would would be doing distributions but can Mike teach anybody any that or is that just his innate qualities and it's not teachable there's probably a tactic that he could share right now and I'm all for cross training um do you have any problem with me saying telling them you know this time keep this time keeping data is just between you me and Tina not a thing not at all and you can tell them my origin how we came to work together um the impact that it had on you last year that mark has been hiring me for over three years now um that he has done this work he's done the time tracking and the time reporting so um you know uh Yeah, I think that that is helpful and to know that, you know, some of the surveys that they've seen in Sweet Law, some of the things that have your team is newer, but that we're constantly looking for supporting and making the best place for the existing people, rather than going, who can we fire? Who can we get rid of? There's never that energy here.
00:44:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I can sell it better like that because it, you know, it doesn't matter how nice Mark and Mary are. There's that upper management where they feel like they have to be a little bit more guarded.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can tell them, Mark's done going to see it, Mark doesn't want to see it. He doesn't even know I'm asking before it. Like that's the autonomy that I have and the autonomy that you have, which in and of itself is part of the culture autonomy and you're not trying to undo it and you wouldn't because micromanagement is a nightmare. It is a just stress cesspool. It's not good for anybody. It feels terrible. This is just data. This is just data. It's data that scares them and you get that because it feels like a microscope. But the intent of the microscope is to go, what can we make better for you, not what's wrong with you?
00:45:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Yeah, I think I can sell that.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The framing is everything and maybe you can tie a reward into it saying like the more accurate the data is after two weeks, like this is what I'm willing to put into it. Maybe you give them, I don't know if it's a financial incentive or maybe just, I don't know. I don't know how to do that. I don't know what motivates your people. But if you could then by sending it incentivize them, or just even show thanks, you know, whatever you have to do, but I can tell you that data is super helpful. There's always an aha moment where we can go, oh, this might be how we can support them better. For example, so one of the surveys that we did was Sweet Law. Black Swan, Black Swan, you know who Black Swan is, right? Yeah. Okay. That came as a result of a survey. That came as a result of me saying, how can we help your people more? Where are they struggling? And one of the answers was converting leads to cases. So it wasn't just intake, but it was also, you know, the attorney team. And it was primarily intake being better at sales, but it also can happen from, you know, getting fired up of cases. And there's this whole persuasion tactic. So But it was a long time going through, just trying to get people to read the book from Black Swan first, and then trying to get the appointment and get the training, like you don't know how many times, every single week, I'm like, where are you at with Black Swan? Well, blah blah blah. Like it just took so long, but as a result of it, Samantha, for example, just reading the book automatically improved, she took some concept from it. She had an aha moment, and from that point forward, applied it and improved her numbers rapidly. I wish I could remember what it was, but I don't know what the tactic was because I didn't read the book anyway. But that's my point, is that we didn't know until we did the survey and asked questions, and somebody was willing to be honest and say, I could be better at sales, and so we got that. And you can share that. There was another, the intake also, at least one person, but I think that there were a couple of people that said, I don't know how to talk to people whose child died or whose spouse died in an accident. Like, this is really difficult. And so we got the grief counselor to come in and talk to them. Did you know that?
00:48:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, but I wish I would have been there because that's like one of the things that I struggle with too was when I because in Arizona, the attorney has to talk to the to the client before they sign. And usually, like, I get a little nervous every time I have to talk to a debt, wrongful death case.
00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, we could, I could get Mark to bring them back in. And also, there are people who didn't get that. So because they're new since then.
00:48:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I do OK. Like, I don't like avoid it if I'm the only one available.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But do you want to do OK? do you want to get some extra skills that can help you be even better at it?
00:49:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm always for extra skills.
00:49:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and that's the thing I want you to take from this is that these things are happening in Sweet Law, but it starts with asking questions, it starts with honest vulnerable answers, then it goes with taking action and trying to improve that situation, but none of it did anybody get, you know, laser pointed, hey, you're coming out of here. It has all been beneficial to the members of Sweet Law.
00:49:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, with the month I'm having right now, I don't know. Oh, we're having a pretty crappy month right now, so.
00:49:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we've got a little bit more time. What is there anything that you feel like you have control over that you can improve that?
00:49:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
There's sticks in the fire, and I know they're going to come, but right now, I mean, it's bad. It's like my worst month so far.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we've been digging into your team. I would like to spend some time working with you and working with your processes. I'm sure that we can do something to improve it. But you are, your team is you. Like these are your resources. So I need you to be successful at persuading them. We need this information. I need to know what your resources are and you need to know what your resources are. Because being able to lean on mic for distributions had to have been really eating to you.
00:50:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah, extremely.
00:50:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So is there other relief that can come for you and for others that we don't know about because we haven't fully inspected. So here's the thing is if Lorenz's pod goes down, guess what happens Like, if you don't hit your numbers and you don't have a job, guess what happens to everybody else?
00:51:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They don't have job.
00:51:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so help me help you, right? Jerry Maguire, then. Tell me the money. Tell me the money. So, look, and we're at the beginning of this, and I need you to just take a deep breath and be like, I am on the path of growth, and I'm willing to do the work. Now, if you see that you could hustle your way to something different, if you could see where you can make some improvements, what, so other than what we've already talked about, I want you to do that. want you to get your team on board with time tracking for two weeks, incentivize them, however you can, but you can be vulnerable to and say, like, this is the worst month I've ever had since I've been here. If I'm out, you're out. And this is not your fault. So, I'm trying to figure out how do I make everybody be as great as possible. possible so that we not only just have jobs but we have jobs we'd like that we want to stay with working with people we like um that's your job that's what you need to do you need to lead them you need to make them trust you because you are trustworthy anyway and you are safe and do that and then I need you to start digging into your processes I need you to track your time Lorenz that would be very helpful to me um I may need to ask Mark about that and say hey can you help me look at this you'll be safe with him just just your time and but I'm asking you at a time if you're okay with that um if you track your time for two weeks and say hey what do you notice about this could you make it better he likes you he knows that you are reliable he you you are wanted you are wanted so he wants you to be good you want to be good the business needs to be good. You'll get paid more if you do better. I need you to trust that you're safe with him as very as with you because you are.
00:53:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's pretty inscrutable when that comes to me.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I get a different perspective and I need you to be able to trust me. I know both sides. I've seen glimpses of it and but I know the game. I know the locker room talk and I know the person and you're as safe with him as very as with you. So but I want you to buckle down. want you to roll up your sleeves. I want you to be vulnerable and I want you to get the work. So start tracking your time very closely. Let me analyze it first. If I can find an not on my own. We can just keep it between us. So that will mean that I need you to be super informative about all these things. So when you track your time, I want you to explain it to me too, because I don't know all the lingo. I don't know all the operations. I don't know a lot, I don't know all of it. So I want you to be really thorough and explain this is this, this is this, this is why this is important. This is what's hard about this. This is what this means to the value of the case. Like, I want you to analyze it as much as you can before you even give it to me.
00:54:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So you don't want just the Y as well?

The Y, the how, the way you prioritize it, what logic you use to prioritize it. I want to understand everything I possibly can understand about it. Because the way my brain works, I should be able to help. And if I can't and we need to get It's what I need insight from market that we can, but the more information you give me, the less likely I'm going to ask or need to ask anything because Lorenz, this is what I do most is optimized. So that data is really important to me. So if you can do a good job of tracking it accurately, timestamps as often as possible, and then really explain it, I can just about guarantee you I can find something to improve you. But now I want to go back and just give you one more reminder that we had one conversation you thought differently about how to make leaders around you and you up to numbers immediately that very next month. So we are going through and we're looking for leverage and we're having way more than one conversation and I don't ever fail because when people will do the work and we get the data, there's always a very simple path to improvement even if it's small and then what happens is those small improvements start to compound. So there's really not anything to be afraid of because statistically I don't feel and the people I work with don't fail if they show up and they get the data and they do the work. It hasn't happened yet. Not saying it can't. I'm just saying that there's always a place to improve a little bit and that little bit of improvement having the compounding effect and now you're multiplying it times everybody else having a little bit of improvement and now your whole team is improving month after month, after year, like that's powerful. Those numbers start to become very obviously much better but what happens in addition to it and this is my favorite part is there's less stress while it's happening because now people understand the mechanics where they weren't even considering the mechanics before. They're like I still have to work and I do what I do. Instead of a stroke to work, I do what I do, but why do I do what I do and why do I do it this way and when they analyze it and then they optimize it, that's a whole new ball game. And so think about when you're driving and you're learning how to drive. There's a lot. And the first time that you get behind the wheel so imagine being a kid being like that's so easy. All you have to do is like press the gas and go room room and turn the wheel my kids every single time until they drive and then they drive it like oh my gosh it's so scary. Yeah, because you're having to make multiple calculations instantaneously on the fly they're so much going through your brain and you're having to evaluate every single thing. Is it my turn to go do I put a signal on do I break it my breaking too much. That guy's going is it my turn and like wait, wait, there's all these different things. Okay, and you're having to process them. And so in the beginning. you're having to make these calculations and they're new, so you're just asking yourself, what are the numbers that even going into the calculations? But eventually, you drive so much that they become reflexive. You automatically know, like, imagine what it was like when you were learning your times tables. At first, you have to sit there and like, it all down and figure it out and find some way to do it. And then you memorize it. And then you know, 4 times 4 is 16. 6 times 6 is 36. Like, you just know what they are. So you don't have to spend time on it, which means it's less stressful because it's reflexive now. Driving is no longer stressful because it's reflexive now. Math is not basic, right? There's a lot of things that become less stressful because they're reflexive because what you did was stop having to make the calculations. So But if you can create the system that removes the need to make the calculations and the calculations are needed because I'm stressed out and how do I figure out how to get through these things when the phone starts ringing all day? Well, I need to come in two hours early, but now I have to go take my two kids who are not even in school yet and get daycare. So I'm going to disrupt their time and it's going to be early and I'm going to spend extra money just so I can do the job that should be able to be contained in the work hours.
00:59:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:59:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's stressful. What if we could get enough information and the only thing that came out of it is Viri is meeting her goals and now she doesn't have to go disrupt the lives of her young children by getting a daycare provider and now somebody, does she trust them? Are they safe? Are they happy? Do they feel loved? Is she stressed out the rest of the time? I'm now because she's leaving her little kids and they're only going to be little for a few more years before they start school. Like, that's a big deal in a person's life. But with a little bit more information, we might be able to figure out how to optimize what we're doing so that her children aren't so that her performance is still good throughout the day because she's not depressed that she had to lead them two hours earlier just to get the job done. Because we're not segmented and segregated here like in other businesses and maybe I should just go back to another firm where at least I only have one type of task and I didn't have to leave my kids. Like, people don't think about all these things in their teammates. Sometimes the bosses aren't thinking about them, but your people are thinking about them and sometimes they just make a decision and then they up and lead. So you need to think about it all proactively. And in order to be able to think about it well, you need eat data and information. So you can use that as an example. If you talk to Viri first and say, can I use this as an example? And maybe you don't use her specifically, maybe find a way around it and draw a similar kind of story that doesn't draw too much attention to her. But at the end of the day, greatness is always hard work. Average is, it's not fun, it's stressful. The average job is people don't want to go. They go because they have to. Because they have to pay bills. That's the average workplace. Showing out to a place that you like to work, even if it's remote and existing with an organization that you like and that you feel safe with, that's not average, that's above average. That's great. But to keep, to get even better, like it takes more or effort. So you have to decide what you want and then you have to decide who you want with you and then you have to decide if you can motivate them to be great with you because it would be so much more enjoyable than just being worried about your job every day or every week or every month.
01:02:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. I'll start trying my time tomorrow then.
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:02:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Hopefully I can be, you know, can have like first-hand experience and then I'll be able to sell them all that even stronger.
01:02:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that and we can wait so that you have some example and then you know if you want to wait a couple weeks before you ask them, track your time.
01:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
and I could only make sense for me to jump into the frame, know, before them.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that. I love leading by example. And then if we find something, a nugget that we can work on to improve for you, you can say, look, this was my experience. I did it, and I know exactly what I can do to make some improvements, and I feel better about it. I feel more peaceful about it. I feel clearer about it. that's everything. You know, you testify yourself, I know that this is going to be good for us, and I'm only looking for the good.
01:03:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You can do this. And the goal, the goal is that it's to, it's to feel great, it's to enjoy the people that you're working with, the work that you're doing. We're not going to enjoy all of it. There's going to be stuff that sucks. That's just life. But you can create packets of just, wow, that's great. These people are great. This is awesome. And it's okay that I have to do this. for the next 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years, whatever it is.
01:04:04 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I want them to know what it's like to feel like you're working every day for someone else's dream. I want to feel like they're working towards their own dreams to they're invested in them.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, the growth of business as much as they are on their own. Yes. And that's a good thing to also what we didn't get to what I would love for you to do is send me what everybody's goals where you said you wanted goals for each of the people about time. my job was waiting for me to take her shopping so she can get ready for girls camp. I'm fine. I'm excited about that. But please send me that just so I have it. And any other notes that you might have just clip notes on how those meetings went. And then so next week, I'm meeting just with Patrick. And then the week after that, we'll have our group meeting and then the week after that is our one on one. So we'll figure it out. out. But if you send that to me an email, then maybe we can just kind of work this in the background. But the very least, that gives you those two weeks to be tracking your time. And I want you to analyze it. want you to look at it and go, huh, maybe, you know, just see if you noticed any kind of patterns.
01:05:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Sure. Yeah.
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Thanks, Tina. You're awesome. Thank you for your time, Lawrence. I hope you have a great week.

Oh my gosh, they are so cute.
00:00:19 - mark sweet
All of them. Yeah, I like.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. They're awesome. I told you I got to meet Esther right on the first call. No. Yeah, so we were talking and I thought I had seen somebody walking in the background, but the background was blurred. So it was hard to tell. And then he's talking about family stuff and he's like, yes, she's my wife. She's right here. And so she came and she sat down and she just talked to me and told me how excited she was for the coaching and. told me, you know, stuff about him and it was it was not what normally happens, but I loved it because like families are really what I'm thinking about most of the time. I'm just getting to it to the business. It's just weird. But anyway, that's me. So that was really cool.
00:01:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. And she's super techy, super smart.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you said that. And she's incredibly gorgeous.
00:01:27 - mark sweet

Yes. Yeah, they have amazing energy. Sorry.
00:01:36 - mark sweet
wish I had like, you know, 200 of those funds for you because you would be the happiest person in the world.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I would be so happy. A few and far between on people like him that exist, unfortunately. Yeah, but that's why you learn to recognize them as gems when you get them. They're like, yeah, you're not normal. And my favorite thing, one of my favorite things to tell people like that. is how special they are, because a lot of times they just have no idea, they just think, you know, whatever, they usually think way less of themselves than the people who are way worse. All right, let me get my notes.
00:02:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, the other new one, I'm talking to her husband, I guess, on Tuesday?
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like tomorrow Tuesday?
00:02:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, it looks more like Tuesday.
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He makes me like, what day is it?
00:02:28 - mark sweet
don't know.
00:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how long have they been in business together?
00:02:37 - mark sweet
Since like 2012. Wow. And then in law school, he did not pass the bar.
00:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did not pass the bar? Like, ever or then?
00:02:50 - mark sweet
He's not a licensed lawyer at this point, so yeah.
00:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Are they both Asian?
00:02:57 - mark sweet
No, he's white.
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with that last name.
00:03:02 - mark sweet
Uh it's all under her name.
00:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. Oh okay.
00:03:06 - mark sweet
I've married or what the deal is.
00:03:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:03:09 - mark sweet
They have three kids together so.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm trying to get the month to date. Let's see.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
We'll see what comes of that. It's interesting if nothing else.
00:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was when I was talking to Fuji. I've been doing more so I typically don't do video calls but I've been trying to incorporate them more often especially with newer people just to get kind of like a baseline reading on people. So again that's how I got to see. Actually I was an on video at that time so Esther didn't get to meet me but anyway it adds a different layer of connection. It's just good. Where is my document? I was trying to get them. I have three minutes to get ready and then you were there early. I'm like, oh, just like Damon. Let's see. Oh, what I want to do is because I keep asking the question and I don't want to keep asking the question. Oh, I do have it. Okay, I just need to update this. So sweet little attorneys, who is doing Missouri cases? Does that just you or Patrick?
00:04:25 - mark sweet
and some just kind over to seeing a little bit.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so he's got those three cases. So let me screen share real quick and if you can just correct anything that you see for.
00:04:46 - mark sweet
So there's no more Robert, Robert's not okay.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make right. I need to have you in here for what you do.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
You got to add Sam, New Mexico.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's right there. Okay, and Hank does what? Huh? Yeah, it turns on. Okay, and what states do you do?
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Everything.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything. So Arizona, California, New Mexico, Washington. Missouri.
00:05:32 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was it. That was the whole process. wasn't where you didn't know. I don't know that.
00:05:41 - mark sweet
We've been everywhere. I'm also licensed in Texas.
00:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:05:48 - mark sweet
Samantha is too. Right.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Texas. that's just you.
00:05:54 - mark sweet
Okay. We have her applying for Illinois, Colorado.
00:05:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. So let me. But that is. You're getting questions. And Nick is working on Washington and he's going to take the Arizona bar in February.
00:06:20 - mark sweet
Patrick is going to take the Nevada bar in February and Hank is going to take the Georgia bar in February.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Yeah, because I was just thinking about this earlier this morning. Um, especially after seeing your the, you know, the month to date and looking at. where, or did I paste that in here yet? on a second. Oh my gosh, zoom is in my way. There it is. Copy. Just thinking about what we're working on in terms of leveraging existing assets and resources but expanding revenue and growth and not necessarily having to get new lead sources because that's what's difficult. So this is our strategy of expanding out into the states. But then I was thinking about making sure that I can track, first of all, who's in each of the states and the way I spelled that. And then just kind of looking at, so like we had three Missouri this month. And when we're talking about the pace that we've been growing, that three, know, that starts getting us some momentum. Even though it's not huge, we're only halfway through the month, that's significant. we started, if we got six more in Missouri every month, which I don't know that we would, but you know, it's just, it's just talking about the potential math, not the probable math. Sure. Looking at that. then also though, who's in Missouri, so if it's just Patrick, but you can do Missouri also, right?
00:08:36 - mark sweet
I'm the only one licensed in Missouri.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So how is it that Patrick can do it because he's working it up and you're technically the attorney?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah. So like, you know, Sam's not licensed in Washington, but she's working on Washington in case it's undermining.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark. Okay, because I want to also kind of keep an eye on the ceiling that might be arriving and reading so we don't have a dashboard for this type of thing so I'm just gonna kind of use a spreadsheet and this is going to have to improve over time but with you know not February is a ways away but we've got how many bars coming up at least three three yeah so three potential will see easy is not at all like end of May if they passed or not
00:10:00 - mark sweet
it takes a while.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. about a year. And that's so Georgia, Nevada is not new though.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
You waved in Nevada, right? Nope. I can't. We've been in Nevada.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
We had a Nevada bar issue, which is probably why it's on your head.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So nobody is in Nevada.
00:10:25 - mark sweet
You can't do Nevada cases right now, right?
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Correct. Okay. So Nevada would be a new, newly opened. Yep. Can anybody work in Georgia right now? Nope. Okay. So Georgia would be a new open.
00:10:39 - mark sweet
And then it would be brand new Illinois would be brand new.
00:10:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So I'm also glad though that we're getting started with the attorneys and it would be good. You know, I don't know when still, but talking with the intake team. Just building up. up kind of that momentum because if we're talking about getting into one, two, four, five new states in May, potentially.
00:11:10 - mark sweet
Yes, potentially.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're shooting for it even if it's three new states and let's say the three new states could get us six new cases every month each. If we got 18 new cases retainers every month and that would be. So matter is matters everything and retainers are because there's people retainers.
00:11:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? Matters are retainers.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:44 - mark sweet
What Mark? Incidences is when it's the lower number.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Incidences is the number of right? Right, right. Okay. Okay. Got it. Right. So, um, Anyway, but if we're getting, I'll just stick with retainers, because that's the number that we're tracking for the most part, like 18 new retainers every month. And then there's the compounding effect of those are open cases that are being worked for a period of a few months actively before they, you know, get to where they start to slow down a little bit. With the amount of attorneys that we have right now, like that, that ceiling will get there faster. So I just want to start plotting the course out and thinking about it because we're also still trying to increase how many retainers we're getting each month. Now, while everybody's still pretty busy right now. Lorenz is kind of capped. So anyway, just making sure that I'm getting all of the data points and that we're really looking at everything all the way around and massaging what we can trying to get and optimizing and getting more. out of what we have leveraging it, but also anticipating that at some point there's probably going to be another ceiling. We're going to have to probably hire other attorneys, but I don't know.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Anyway, so I was just thinking about 150 retainers a month for you now. We've got five main pods, I'll call it.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing with that though is that's a very basic and generic number spread across your pods when all your pods do not function the same and they don't all operate in same states.
00:13:37 - mark sweet
So while that I mean that math to me is like not even dirty that's just right so it's so we're just going to stay with Arizona. Arizona only goes busy enough to keep him solid. Hank with being relatively you know, we can give him other states to work on. He doesn't have to just only be Arizona. He's losing Arizona, he's licensed in Arizona, but you know, clearly he wants to take the Georgia bar and he's open to do another things. You don't know if he's been an attorney long enough that he can wave into some of these states, but if he does well in the Georgia bar, you can wave into some of these states as well. Okay. So, you know, I can see him eventually taking cases or New Mexico cases.
00:14:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Our short term issue is we're spending more we're bringing in, which is never good. So, you know, we Got to keep our group.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:09 - mark sweet
I'm waiting for it to catch up. know it will catch up. Give me now of cases that we're signing.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just. And that big settlement that you just had the dad not help.
00:15:20 - mark sweet
Balance about that gets us back to even plus 500 grand basically. So, I mean, it was in a good position. It's not like it's a bad position. But obviously I would hope that that money would have gone a lot further.
00:15:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, so if you forecast, if you, I mean, you can forecast at this point, right, to some to a pretty solid degree. So, what happens when you forecast it out, right? It's you should be able to say, Hey, like I just did this for us, right? I forecasted. that we will hit our subscriber ceiling, I forget what day I did this on, but it was 155 days from the day that I did it. And then at our meeting this morning, we are 30 shy of hitting that ceiling. And when that happens, that's it. We're not going to get any more revenue unless we change something, right? So in our scenario, I have to change new customer, the new customer metric, which is I'm working on that, right? That's the only path to growth. Same thing with you, right? The path to growth is more retainers. But in my forecast, our overhead doesn't change, right? So it's like, we just won't make more money. We lose customers, we make less. But if we say here, it's like, we're just going to get stuck. And what I figured out was when we zoomed out, like when I zoomed out, which will be different for you, right? When I zoomed out, was like, oh, really don't work. really just kind of stuck for lack of a bit of word or no, it's actually true. Like we're just stuck at around three million, you know, 2.8 to 3.2 million a year. Like we just float in and out of that zone, throwing in the global pandemic. So it's like, okay, if nothing changes, if actually not nothing, if that new customer metric does not change, nothing else will change, we can just stay like this. for you, it's like, okay, how do you forecast this stuff? Because this is the scenario, like, it just made me think of, oh, it's my buddies, even knows this. I don't think I told you the story. So in, yeah, in January, my buddies like, oh yeah, we're gonna triple the business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 60 days later, he was laying on top of stuff because he, and I swear, Tina, up. And it was, Because his, he forecasted improperly and like was using some math magic, some really happy math. I was like, Hey, man, I don't know about this. And within 60 days, he was asked out completely upside down, laid off after staff, and is now still playing catch up. So that was in March. And he's kind of, he's treading water now, but they're about to lay off like their number one salesperson. The benefit of it was, I mean, I don't know if there really was a benefit, I guess there was, is like, now he's really digging into like the inner numbers, right? He's not just looking at the surface level things. He's going deeper on these numbers. And he's also figuring out that certain processes don't work that great. But here, it's like, what's if you forecast that, what actually shows you what's going to happen. That's the concern I have it's like okay if I look when when when is that what is that horizon like oh yeah we're gonna be back we're gonna be in the black whatever you want to call it in 140 days because xyz is gonna happen based off of all this data I mean you have years and years with the data granted you do have growth that's happening over here but and never assume growth I would never unless rock solid yeah how'd we look at that looking at it if I use a hundred retainers and I would throw out the person outlier cases to me those aren't real those are just creepy yeah I can't rely on those no I'm looking at a hundred incidences or sorry a hundred retainers which were usually beyond but I think a hundreds of pretty solid number 15% between drop and sub-out rate which the real numbers 12 I'm using 15 as a
00:20:00 - mark sweet
conservative number. It consists of 85 cases that should pay out out of the market. If I use the $12,000 average fee, and I'm sure you remember we ran this a while ago, our average fee.
00:20:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, I use 11, yep, 21.
00:20:19 - mark sweet
Yeah, let's use 12 grand again, conservative, that should put us a little over a million. Our monthly overhead is around a million. fluctuates from month to month, but that's around where our breakeven points.
00:20:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, that's before.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, is that we've sent out?
00:20:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is your overhead increasing at the same rate? Like are you just creating more, but getting less, right? You create more revenue, but you're creating more overhead, right? Are these things just moving in conjunction? So your for your bottom line numbers going up, but that's it. you're not really making, you're not picking anything up for doing this other than more employees, more this, more that.
00:21:12 - mark sweet
Like, it's more, more, more, more, more, more, but what it's not more of is profit. Sure answer is yes. Long answer is yes with a butt. And the reason I'm saying Yes with what? A butt, because the answer is yes. But the more cases I have in my pipeline, the more value my firm has. The more I could theoretically decide tomorrow to stop advertising, right?
00:21:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
cut down people and The Salko model.
00:21:37 - mark sweet
Salko model. Two more cases you're bringing in the higher chances of getting one of those whales, right? Larger net. True. Catch a bigger fish.
00:21:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, so that's all, all right. So, I mean, obviously, the Salko model I get, but that's like this long-term play. Are you really? I do you really think you're going to do that?
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't even think you wanted to go that way. So let's definitely talk this out.
00:22:10 - mark sweet
No, it's that or you sell.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, value your firm is in your case.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. made the decision. I made the decision like 60, 90 days ago. Like when we got another PE firm come in and offer us a bunch of money, it wasn't enough money. But it was the first time ever that I was like, you know what? I would sell it now. So now I've shifted and my plan is to sell it in three years. Like I've set a time like in three years, I want to be I want to sell it. So I'm building it now and massaging it like getting I got this new bookkeeper and I'm getting a valuation done right now. We're setting up all new. We're setting up these docs. So I'm positioning it to sell and then I'm bringing in an advisor to help. to show me, hey, they sell these kinds of companies. So I'm engaging them now so that in three years, this thing is just shining and everything looks great. And then they're going to go selling. That's it. That's what I'm doing. It's happening. If it doesn't sell, I don't care. If I just make the business better, we make more money, that's not well and good. But my goal is really to sell it. If I just end up with a more profitable seven-figure business, oh, well. So I wonder if you should, I don't know, I mean, you could operate in those terms, right? And you'd be in this exact same position, right? be like, OK, well, I just made it all better and I'm going to keep it. But I'm doing all these things with this sort of thing in mind. And then what does that really look like? So for me, I know now, hey, I got to really figure out this new customer thing because that's where I'm going to add to the bottom line and therefore that's going to add to I know that that multiple whatever the multiple is that it's eight if I increase that metric that eight is worth more. The eight's only worth what it is right now like at a a 22 new customers a day average which is what we average no no matter what it's that times eight or that whatever the multiple is right so I go okay great if I want that multiple to have more value than I need to change this one metric so I'm only focused on figuring out how to change that metric so for you it's like what what does constitute the value right what does it what what would be the best looking version of it in three or four or five years whatever your horizon is and then how do you start to do things now to make it that then right is it and maybe it is you just keep doing this thing where you're going grow grow grow grow and like your profit margin doesn't change at all because that's how the multiple works there. I don't know, but something to think about.
00:25:08 - mark sweet
It's definitely something to think about. And again, the numbers that gave you were the most conservative numbers, right? the like Rosie everything's perfect. I use the 12% drops about rate, which is our actual rate, and that number should go down, and our 12,000, 684, 99 number, you know, now we're at 1.116. We make 100 grand a month, give or take, which, you know, it's not like that's insane, but it's not terrible. And that's not going to any referral fees or any big cases. So to me, it's keep growing and keep looking at what our average settlement is in these states. And are there any outliers that throw that number off? And then does it make sense, you know, take Washington, for example, does Washington still make sense in two or three years? Part of the problem is, We're spending a lot on the advertisement and it's taking a while to chase the tech.
00:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Is 10%, I mean, that's a 10 profit margin. Like, is that a good number? I don't even know. I don't know what the math is in this world.
00:26:16 - mark sweet
It should be about 20%.
00:26:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
10% when you're going through growth is so no.
00:26:22 - mark sweet
20% to 20% to a third is where you're really trying to be, depending on if you can do and what not. I would be perfectly fine with a 20% profit margin. I think that is fine.
00:26:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right. So are you not getting 20% now due to operational inefficiencies? Like, what's preventing you from getting 20% now? Is it because you're on this track of like, hey, that's just not possible because we're doing this thing? Or is it like, oh no, that should be possible right now.
00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it your incentive program?
00:26:53 - mark sweet
The incentive program is not helping.
00:26:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have high payroll.
00:26:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Our payroll is high. It should be like 25 to 28% and it's closer to like 37%. So our payroll is high because of current incentive package, right? that's mostly the attorneys. That's really where the money is going.
00:27:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:17 - mark sweet
Yeah. And obviously our advertising costs is high too. We're getting it better under control. But if I look at it for the year, we had some swings and misses. That we lost money on. Yeah. If I was better.
00:27:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. the payroll is like fixed.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the real problem.
00:27:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Marketing's variable payroll is fixed. And then if the goal is this longer term thing, what you know, right? And I know, because I know the talk a model is that you would just eliminate marketing altogether because your firms then subsiding strictly on referrals. And blah, blah, blah, blah. And brand, right? Pray to some degree. That's interesting. So I've been going. I'm back and forth with the ad sergely guys because they're like, they don't understand why the conversion rate for sweet loss so much worse for lack of a better term than everyone else. Right. So that's why I was late because I was lacking with him. So he told me that he, and he showed me like all the metrics of these other firms. He's just not showing me their names. The firm in Washington that is that multi-state firm like they're closing 30% of the leads like, okay, great. And then the other firms in other states, the average is 14% and ours with them is somewhere like five, which is what we keep seeing over and over and over. My argument to him that I wanted to bring to you that ties directly into what we just talking about is I'm telling him Mark's criteria is different. They're signing lower value cases and they just, they either doing it on purpose or they just don't know. And he's like, well, that doesn't make sense. I got no .
00:29:00 - mark sweet
but I go it makes sense only in this way and I don't know if this is smart and so I'm gonna run this by mark and weirdly we just kind of kind of covered it like maybe they're doing it on purpose because they're trying to expand their user base right and that they're playing into this long-term model I don't believe that for a second because I think they're not doing the math it's not just that it's the difference between me and all these other firms is they look at is this a case and I made this one first started and a lot of the larger firms are guilty of this is this a case the answer that is yes for me it's is the lemon worth the squeeze and more often than not there is no for a lot of these other firms it's it's a case and it's a completely different mindset I could probably double what our retention rate is If I was not so picky, or I did not require so much information on fraud, I promise you that there are pieces where they don't know if there's insurance, they don't know any of the liability, they are more than like the property damage photos, and so they're drop rate.
00:30:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I think is happening. And I'm about to prove it to him, because I was pointing this out to him said, look at the turn down rates, there's a distinct, I don't know, no treatment, no injury. Unless somehow we're getting these very special leads, that exact percentage exists across everything, they are signing those. And my guess is if I go and do the math, let's say that our conversion rate with them is 7%, guess what the other 7% is going to be, those two reasons. And I'll be like, dude, if the math is right there, they're signing them. And it shouldn't be and that's the difference and so in that context It's like this is what I was saying to my go and I also told them the 30% Washington I'm like dude, they're referring those out. We don't count those. Yeah, they get tracked But they don't count because they're not real money. It's not a real real retainer So if you take those out of theirs That's probably gonna drop them down to like the 14% average my guess is that they I'm not my guess I saw it they'd refer a ton of them So they're signing crappy ones and that was must be extra crappy and then they were throwing them out. So with him like, okay, let's get to What is the cost of working with you to get us a Sweetlaw retainer, right? Because these aren't all equal in any stretch of the strictly with it, right? So yeah, I was like, there's no way there's no way they're signing them as part of a grander strategy They just don't know I I this, I know he's not going to have the answer, but they tell you their average value per retainer because I can guarantee it's lower than ours. And if it is, then that proves my point, but I think I can prove my point doing that analysis just as it's late.
00:32:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, it just makes sense. And again, if you've got larger firms, they're signing it, they've got capacity. It's the same reason we're referring up is they're getting signed up and getting referral fees. It's not a case, right? Yes. For me, it's a lot of work or lot of...
00:32:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It won't math out. It won't math out.
00:32:37 - mark sweet
Yeah. takes a lot more labor to get that out than one that contains a lot more issues.
00:32:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. And it will lower, it would probably lower your overall average on the real stuff because you're people are running around working on stuff.
00:32:51 - mark sweet
So it's going to bring down the whole thing. However, every now and then there's a diamond in the room, which is why it won't do anything.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But it's gotta be super rare.
00:33:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's kind of like, I don't know, it just seems like gambling math to me where because you have less control of it and it's not because it's not the norm because it's an outlier. And just thinking about, there's multiple things. Again, the SACO model has a much longer runway. So one of the things and the math activities we could should do would be to look at that. What does that runway look at? What are the variables? What, what does it look like to get there? So I like to reverse engineer. What does it look like when we're there? What's the difference here to there? What are the steps that would have to happen in order to. get there what's the nearest step take that step and it works better reverse engineering because you know what it it that's just the definition right so starting to do it the other way it gets really confusing and you can make some really bad choices but then when you look at so reverse engineer where you want to go come back what does it look like what are those steps what's just too big of a leap to take because it's too risky too much change too much volatility in the business obviously you want to step it down from whatever that is that you can mitigate risks along that path but the longer you play the game of i want to take as many as possible within the realm that you already have right that you won't take all garbage stuff so that you have the a greater opportunity to catch the big fish. You're playing two different games. You can't play both games at the same time. So at some point, one has to become the priority goal and one has to be sacrificed. And those decisions should be made mathematically. But we haven't even begun to outlive the, or lay out the framework for that equation. But since we're having this conversation now and we're looking at it, that's where we should be going late. that would be a whole calling itself just trying to start the math. Because of all the assets you have, all the people you have, all the sources that you're going, like, what does that look like for sweet law? Because there's, you're not going to have the same amount of staff. So anyway, it just depends on how much you you're interested in that. Whereas before, I think it was a no way in hell, am I doing that?
00:36:07 - mark sweet
And now it's a it's either that or so, or, you know, conclusion, the problem of the soccer model is, yeah, it's a it's a runway, but with a brick wall at the end of it.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Right.
00:36:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and everyone and a bunch of people get fired.
00:36:21 - mark sweet
Right. And who's going to work where the ship that's going down?
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. But so here's the thing, we're having this conversation sounding like that's a potential. We need to block our energy off from anything that's not even a real opportunity. So if you're really not even actually consider going down that path, then we need to stop talking about it and stop putting any energy to it. If you really are considering it, then you need to ask yourself, are you really willing to take the actions that have to happen, taking the people.
00:37:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
into account in order to make that happen and if so on what time frame are you talking about it two years from now five years from now 10 years from now because all of that makes a big difference but whatever conversation we're having needs to be real needs to be what we're actually working towards or we need to stop talking about it yeah who's what someone talks about like you know you can't have a B right you work the A it's like don't have a B because that it's it's a distraction the B becomes a distraction because you're considering this thing that you're not going to really do and you it pulls focus from the A so if the A is really selling the firm in and then yes put a time frame on it but with or without a time frame you can certainly define hey this is like what I was saying for me it's like this is what it needs to look like in order for me to sell it and maybe the time frame is like It's going to take me three years to even get to that point, right? But that point can be defined now. And if that point is like, hey, no one's going to want to buy this firm because I know my overhead is too high, well, then that needs to be factored in, like, how do I reduce that overhead in three to five years or whatever the timeframe is? then, I mean, in a way, you have sort of this B, it's not even a B, it's like a fall back. The fall back would be like, oh, if I do all these things to sell it, in theory, I could fall back to this Salka thing because it would just be there. But it's not being factored in at all. It's just sort of this known backstop that's there, but it's because I focused on the A version of this. No, that's my- So start firing people is what I'm hearing Tina say.
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is not what I said.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
But I heard a whisper, it's going to be there, like, no matter what I do, that's always going to be an option.
00:39:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:39:07 - mark sweet
Yep. And realistically, it's not even a plan. It's like, it's a fallback. It also has more value to my firm that let's me get larger lines of credit or whatever I need to do for growth or whatever.
00:39:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's growth in the context of selling, right? So then what, I mean, I don't know when Jacobi sells, right? what is the metric here?
00:39:35 - mark sweet
Is the metric straight?
00:39:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's profit margin in bottom line?
00:39:39 - mark sweet
No, because they're a brand. They're in the name.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am not. Well, yeah, that's true.
00:39:44 - mark sweet
That's not the problem. is significantly different than theirs. My value is the value of my cases and nothing else. Okay. I mean, yes, there's some value to my systems. Yes, your value to my people. Yes, there's somebody in my processes. what I do is very rip it.
00:40:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Replicatable. Okay.
00:40:05 - mark sweet
Right. there's nothing special. Like if Tina's law office tomorrow could pull from the same sources.
00:40:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you haven't the same I had, you could do the exact same thing I do. Right. Totally. The only difference would be that they don't know the numbers yet. Right. That's your advantage right now is that you've gone through and figured it all out. And now you're like, okay, these are the numbers, these are the targets. That's why the dude in Arizona failed. Right. We know that without even without knowing anything. He thought, right, money, money gets cases done. And it's, we know, because I say it all the time, it's idea money, excuse me. So you started the, what's interesting about your scenario is that it wasn't necessarily your idea. You changed the idea. The idea was Steve's idea and Steve's idea was wrong. He, he had ideas. money. And he's like, idea money, and then he sort of had the execution that was you, right? I'm going to execute it. But the idea was wrong. The idea was that he could spend money to get cases. And that wasn't true. So then he left you holding the bag, and then you change the idea. You were like, okay, I'm going to find vendors to get, I'm going to figure out how to get a series of vendors to get cases. So it was similar idea. But his sort of just relied on throwing a bunch of money at it. And it didn't work. And that's what the dude in Arizona did. His idea was, hey, if we throw a bunch of money at it, it turns into retainers. It turns into money. Of course, the idea being that every retainers equal, like God only knows what their math was. God only knows what Steve's math was. But then Steve's new idea was, I'm going to go buy marks, essentially, right? I'm going to go buy sweet loss. And that's what he started doing. And I'm sure his math is still bad.
00:41:53 - mark sweet
But that was a better idea than that. He's extremely different than mine. His math is, I can absorb a higher cost for gay speaking. because I get more out of them than anyone else.
00:42:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:42:03 - mark sweet
He's making a ton of money, so clearly, if not worse, I don't understand how necessarily.
00:42:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if you don't understand how, it doesn't really work.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
If you're sitting there questioning it, they don't reduce their fees ever for clients. I think they're outsourcing some item so they're payroll may be lower and just charting into the client.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, his math might not be all that great. By making this, he's getting $10 million settlement, or he doesn't refer it up.
00:42:40 - mark sweet
He keeps it lit again.
00:42:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are they even going have to get that?
00:42:44 - mark sweet
They are. They've got some good litigators there. Now, now they've got some. And again, they've got a brand. So they've got people, you know, being the name forever, you call in. So their costs should go down or whatever. time, but he's buying.
00:43:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. They're sort of hybrid model at this point. They're doing, they're sort of working multi models, basically.
00:43:09 - mark sweet
I mean, realistically looking at all of this, what I probably should do is save up enough money to spend a year worth advertising on billboards in Washington state. Steve's not in Washington. Yeah, they don't know who he is. Or Illinois or Missouri, like a state he's not going to.
00:43:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wonder what the alternative to billboards is, right? It's like, what's the bill? Is it like next door in Hulu? Like, what's what's the new billboard where like you're in everyone's face? Like, I see these commercials on Hulu. I've never seen a legal commercial on Hulu. But you're inundated with them now. And then it's like on next door. It's like, where what are the it's not Facebook.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, what are the
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equivalent of billboards.
00:44:01 - mark sweet
It's YouTube.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I ran a bunch of YouTube ads.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about TikTok?
00:44:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, you can't, I don't know. mean, how do you, if a billboard is someone on their commute, it's like, how do you inter interject yourself?
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would test basically a billboard ad on TikTok. Because here could be, well, I, but I think it's cheaper on TikTok, but I don't know. But I would test and I do like this theory because I do think that social media is the better billboard or TV spot type ads, the streaming ads, because if you don't need it, so you don't have to have a long spot. It just has to be short and frequent. And so that somebody who has been in a wreck or recently gets in a wreck is going to have seen that, and the frequency is the most. or important thing, and a memorable number or access point website, whatever, but it's one of those things you don't need it unless you need it, and you're not looking for it unless you need it. So frequency and location, which is why billboards work, people pass them back and forth on their commutes. It is effectively the same thing, but it should be cheaper, and the exposure should be better, and the tracking is way better, which means the opportunity to optimize is better. And unless you've been seeing it, most of your competitors probably aren't doing it. Most of them are more old school, playing the old school game, dominating those spaces. I think that there's a lot to be looked into. This is not my area of expertise in terms of where to get it, but we could find those people and try it, set the budget aside, but I do think that that would be much better than billboards is TV spots and social media spots, but very short, very clear, billboard-esque so that you're not spending for a lot of time, but it's just frequency and location, location being digitally in their faces frequently. Personally.
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's like, what's the digital equivalent? If you think about a billboard, they're strictly like zip code base, right, and their routes, right, roads and zip codes, so it's like, hey, we're buying a billboard on this street in this zip code, right, and basically this lower income neighborhood is where they are, for the most part, right, or major, or in major, major thorough thoroughfarers, so it's like, what is the digital equivalent of that? I don't think you need to do that just like the bus. It's like buses, but that's what the if if you're gonna If you're gonna emulate that strategy You have to be like, okay I feel like this is the bus and or the banchan or the billboard like I think I'm just going through my head right now I see the whole day long here.
00:47:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see like who are you talking to the those neighborhoods?
00:47:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, that's the targeting the targeting is where Where is the who is it touching, right?
00:47:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like you drive by the billboard That's it and it's they picked that billboard for a reason so typically because it's Psychology behind it is Because you just made me think of something that we could discuss about this is first of all people of all Wealth ranges, I can't think of the word economic statuses Yeah, um, get in rex, but the bigger impact and the need to handle it strategically is with the impoverished people who like I can't afford to get health care I can't afford to get things fixed. Because a lot of times I mean you just make a call go to insurance people just like deal with it. I don't know. I don't know that that's true. That's an assumption, which I would be trying to get more data on if I'm trying to build the most optimized business. I would want to know what are the statistics of hiring a personal injury attorney across the income lines. What does that look like. Now, because here's the difference between billboard placement and doing it online is that placement has to work and it has to work for that demographic. And you don't want to waste eyeballs because of how much it costs whatever. Whereas when you're, when you're doing an online and casting a wider net, Mark can practice in all of these different states, and now he's, he's got less competition, because his competitors aren't in that same space, which is not the situation with the billboard ads. So understanding the frequency of hiring an attorney engaging an attorney, at least even exploring it with personal injury with an accident. And what is the competition presence in those spaces because those two are significant variables that billboards can't really change because they're physically located in one place. So, like, it isn't apples to apples, no matter how much we try to emulate it. I think it would be foolish to try to replicate it, I think taking the best practices, which is very The clear language, the visualization of it, the will get you help, you know, that type of thing, but things that we can do that billboards can't do a split test. We can track demographic engagement. You can't do that with billboards. you know, the angle that you're taking to me is a little bit like, I don't know. I think it's not tapping into the advantages that we have by doing it online.
00:50:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, when I've never seen someone do, and it's just my personal experience, it's like, what they do with billboards bus ads, whole thing, they're always hitting the vanity number. It's always the vanity number, right? So, what they're trying to slam home is this brand, this vanity number. So, you would emulate those aspects in an online ad, right? Whether it's a fixed image or it could be a video, right? But... it's really hammering home those two things so you would get a vanity number and then you dedicate it to your billboard scare quotes which is your online app and you would use and then you would rely on these these are how many people we've held from this how many millions of dollars we've gotten and settled or whatever no no the vanity number is like one eight eight five five five five five five five oh like they're all taken they all cost and seen amount of money but you have to have some that's yeah it might be easy to remember yeah you need a hooky something um like here it's i think the guy's number is all zeros or some maybe not that would be a terrible number we'll get you zero nine million um most different stories is 800 all sevens um Morgan and Morgan's got one that's the blades yeah yeah but that's what they do right so they're hammering home the brand and the number And it's literally just with the classic marketing of just repetition, right? They just keep repeating the same message over and over and over. They're just drilling it in people's heads. And then when the time comes, they're like, oh, I got in the car accident, I'm going to call 1-800-the-LAW, or whatever it is, and they do.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you use also a QR code?
00:52:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They have to scan it. So the way that it works traditionally is that they're remembering the hook. So it's like, you need the hook. Yeah. Or either in the name or in the number.
00:52:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, does it have to be? So first of all, there's options. There's so many different phone services with different prefixes where I think potentially you could get that if, and maybe there's a person whose job literally is just to go get you the best member memorable that stands out.
00:53:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or you have to figure out a hooky thing and then get the, you know, the decoded version of that, right? So you're as 1-800-COME 1-800-APPA and you're like, oh, it's available, but it won't be. It's like a domain name. It's like it's not going to be available. You have to pay a crap ton of money for it.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you just have to be a little bit creative in the way that you think of it, because like I can always find a domain that works really well that's available. It takes a lot of thinking about it and then you just have to brand that. But it's the thinking and it's always the thinking that does the winning because most people won't think that far and they won't think that hard, but that's the way you win this game.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to emulate that stuff, you have to come up with, that would be the works. And then, and get it. And then you'd copy that online and you could copy in all the ways that we just talked about, you could do it on the TikTok, right? Maybe you run these things in separate, distinct runs, right? But you have to run them for like, I mean, this is always trying to do the math in my head, right? So if you figure a billboard, someone goes by twice a day, right? So that's two impressions per person per day. So you'd be like, okay, I'm going to cap that aspect. I'm going to allow two impressions a day per person, because that's like a billboard. But same thing, they're going by maybe once or twice a day, any more than that's probably excessive. But then it's every day, because that's their commute. That's the way to the house. That's the store they stop every day when they're on their way home, whatever it is. So you would cap the impressions to two per day per person. And then what is that costing you? What does that cost on Hulu? What does that cost on TikTok? What does that cost on whatever? You could probably get kind of project that out. And it's like, okay, what you don't know is how long does that need to run until it turns into a phone call, a lead, or whatever, like that's the big question mark. then once you're committing to that, trying to figure that out, and then you would like a billboard, you would just leave it on in perpetuity. Hopefully you have tracking that can buy it back to TikTok or that becomes part of your intake. You get some of that, where'd you see us? But yeah, and it would likely be cheaper than a billboard, for sure.
00:55:41 - mark sweet
Well, people think billboards equal legitimacy.
00:55:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I think it's the repetition is what it's because, I mean, it's the advertising, it's the repetition that them seeing over and over and
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the imagery so it's it's in his favorite thing it's what does name space she loved it he's ready to hire him what are you talking about when you saw the sweet chains girl boards that are trashed fella oh boy almost doesn't matter what's on there as long as it's that frequent and it looks like authority and there are so the colors you know the navy blue um gold uh there are different colors that have psychology behind them um there's a whole color rule of psychology but it's also going to be so if it looks like something they've seen um there's black backgrounds basically and navy blue backgrounds the majority of them that's what they have they're used to seeing people in suits and ties big language they're to seeing a scale of justice, that imagery, a big phone number, you know. So, people that are in metro areas are used to seeing billboards like that. People in rural areas who still can make you just as much money and are not seeing your competition as much, they don't see those billboards. So, they see at best an ad in the paper and it's not very good, or they see a card that somebody's handed them because they live in a small town where there are no billboards. And you want, you're going to be targeting those people, that's probably actually the majority of them. So, you have to take that into account too. But even still, suits and ties, the scale of justice, navy, black, professional corporate type stuff makes people feel like, oh, that's an attorney. That's not Billy Joe down on the street who's brother is practicing law and says he can help me out, that kind of thing. So anyway, but it's starting somewhere. First of all, finding people that know those channels and can advertise well on them. Getting, I think we could probably find somebody to help us get a good vanity number without having to spend our time on it.
00:58:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking right now.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's horrible. then the other thing is to get a list of all the sources where you could get toll-free numbers. not 800, but a toll-free number and then find a few different phrases and basically we use chat2bt to give us a few different scenarios and then basically maybe take one of your assistants and systematically go through each of the toll-free providers with each of those phrases and see which ones possible. Eventually we get there. It's the great things, which is what we're aiming for doesn't come from little efforts and flukes. And you know, we just arrived there. It's strategy and it's systematically going from this step to this step to this step to this step. But and then, you know, there's innovation and disruption, which is where you're at right now, because your market is still primarily radio and billboards and maybe TV spots. There might be some people coming out of it, but we know enough to know that people buy from what they see on online ads and streaming ads and things like that. So it's not a huge risk. You can mitigate the risk by with the budget, but the likelihood and even probability that you could do better by putting some very strategic ads short, low level of exposure again with the math that that Dan was doing with the bill. boards, although I would probably want to double that if they see it two times a day. want to let them see it four times a day. If it's just a few cents per impression, I don't know.
01:00:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I would just try to near what's real, right?
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're like, okay, I'm trying to do define what's real though.
01:00:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like this is billboards. If you're commuting to work, well, you not pass it four times a day.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay, but I'm saying we should not be trying to duplicate billboards because you can't and it's so much better. So we're using billboard type strategy and ads, basically essential of it and knowing that those are the big competitors. And then the rest of the emulation would be from other successful ads that people are running on streaming services that are working for them.
01:00:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But we don't have any data on other.
01:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find data. Anyway, I'm sure we can find data like if this is what we want to look at and it's worth really looking into and looking at it. Well, we can put some meat on this framework and and plot a course that that has some numbers behind it. So we're not just, you know, going blind, but we would have to decide that's what we're going to do. Who's going to go get the data and look at that, because again, going back to you trying to optimize everything that we have based on our resources. The fact that payroll is excessive and marketing is excessive. The faster one to try to correct could be marketing because payroll is going to be a whole, if you cut that back, there's a morale issue. And I'm not saying you don't cut that back, but, you know, replacing attorneys becomes difficult, and I don't know. You know, maybe that ends up working if you lose one attorney and you said, basically everybody can do from everywhere. It's just somebody else has to, you know, look, they have to pair up with somebody who is Able to work in in that state. That's a possibility.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So maybe you Yeah, that's that tricks on something. Thanks.
01:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I told you forget about this.
01:02:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? So I have a buddy that is barred in DC. He's now barred in California. Here in California, he had a job working for I forget the name of the place, but it was like in the legal department and the head of the legal department was a lawyer. So he worked under that lawyer and like did all the contract work, right? he knew all that stuff, but he was never I'm gonna say I don't know what to call it the lawyer of record or whatever, but he literally did all the work and then that person's name was attached to it. So it's like, what is that version? That guy can't command the same level that an actual barred lawyer can command. But it's like, is that, is that even possible?
01:03:15 - mark sweet
There's some, yeah, there's a huge difference. If you're in-house counsel in a corporate firm, it doesn't matter as much for your license. If they have to go to a corporate proceeding, he has to just pro hop in. So if you're doing too often, it's a problem. But if you're working in-house, it's not. Okay.
01:03:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Very different. There's no version of that in your world.
01:03:38 - mark sweet
That's what we're doing now. They're just doing it under my name.
01:03:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, what really? So these guys don't need to be lawyers? Theoretically.
01:03:48 - mark sweet
Technically. Diego can run a case from start to finish. As long as I'm signing off on it, it doesn't matter.
01:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that solves your payroll problem.
01:03:59 - mark sweet
No. It doesn't, because lawyers and case managers don't handle cases the same way, they're generally not as good, and they don't get as much money.
01:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I would argue that becomes a process issue, right? Could that be solved the process? So, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, would be like, don't know how would you test that theory, not in your office, right? Where people are like, wait a minute, he's gotten non-lawyers working on cases, what the hell is going on? That's a lot.
01:04:32 - mark sweet
mean, it's like Daniel Kim. Are you serious? He's attorney in his entire office. 99% of work that's getting done is being done by people who are not lawyers. Oh, so that is a thing. She failed law school and she just was borrowing an old man's lawyer.
01:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is real. I didn't No way.
01:04:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you could bring Kim Kardashian on the staff is what I'm hearing. This would do wonders for your marketing.
01:05:02 - mark sweet
Yes.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, okay in-house.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, let me go up in the lenses.
01:05:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's interesting. So you could have like, you, Mark, could take more cases in-house. know, everyone's on your name, but you could start taking more cases and then have like a sidekick that's not a lawyer, but you're like, this dude knows his or gal. They know their stuff, but they're not barred. So there's no threat of that person like going to another firm. So you could pay that more than like less than a Sam or whatever, more than the other, because you're like, I see that you're more than a case manager, right? So you went to law school, whatever, and then, and then teach them how to run a case the right way. And it's like, okay, and then, then that's it. Then they just know how to run the cases the right way, and then you just keep giving them cases. question is how are you-
01:06:00 - mark sweet
We found those people don't want to usually have some pretty large words, right? Otherwise, why are they not a lawyer? I still have all the liability here. So she's also got liability. I do have her supervising attorney, but her license on the line too.
01:06:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right.
01:06:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, totally. So there's a different level of responsibility versus Diego, who I get a bar complaint or I get super malpractice, it just goes on as another job.
01:06:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, maybe then that maybe that's where, so maybe that's where an incentive package actually works in your favor. I don't know that the incentive actually works in your favor with the lawyers, right?
01:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because they can't skate, but this person's like, hey, oh, yeah, it does what Samantha you can, you can tell.
01:06:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but so the grand scheme of things, there is a version of the world. There's a, there's a version of the where there are no attorneys on style. That's interesting. I didn't think that was really a thing.
01:07:05 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah. know there's a lot of those.
01:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had no idea.
01:07:08 - mark sweet
I just didn't see plausible. product is usually garbage, but yeah.
01:07:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is where my checklist argument is like, if the process is so dialed, you can mitigate that.
01:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.
01:13:44 - mark sweet
Okay, I'll talk about the script essentially does.
01:13:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I read it. I'll send you my notes because I'm like, to me, it's not a script. Okay. But parts of it are like it's in there.
01:13:57 - mark sweet
It's weird. The presentation, was like, well, it's not really a script. But, uh, but it's way there.
01:14:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's that first minute dude. Like I don't know if you guys listen to calls, but it's just getting whether they should stay on the phone right up right after the cell mutation. Like there just needs to be like one question, which I think it's sort of there. And then it's like, to me it was, I'm used to reading it like in a script mode. I don't know. Like from like being on sales teams in a certain way, that was like an overview of like the strategy sort of that. Like so, but whatever I read it, I would just change like that one part. And then because it's, if they get into the other parts, great. It's really just like, should they still be on the phone? That was the thing that I just kept running into like, dude, you should not be on this call. You're like wasting your time.
01:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that gets into call control training. That's all. Call flow. Yeah. All All All All All All All So we can keep working on that too. All right. We okay bad it.
01:15:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This 800 number stuff is for the birds.
01:15:17 - mark sweet
industry is clearly captured. We do have one half the one that we got produced this year. One eight hundred nine seven five two thousand. And not that difficult of a number to remember.
01:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not bad.
01:15:31 - mark sweet
That's a ring. You're paying numbers or whatever. Those are going for high six figure to seven figure.
01:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just going to work. How much do you pay for that?
01:15:40 - mark sweet
We have it. I don't remember how much.
01:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we paid like a couple grand for it. Yeah. I think you can make that work. And again, it's repetition. So how many times does it get repeated? Like is it is it being said, it doesn't flash on the screen. It does a flash on the screen while it's being said. repeatedly those things stick in your head and so it's not just what you have but it's how you use it. That's workable.
01:16:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah and we can just mess around with it because it could it could be like you're sitting here like sometimes you just go boom there it is right so it's like you got this this one and then you might come up with one I'm like trying to do one around like oh I well the other thing is how adjacent is it to somebody else's so like if you ever typed a domain name wrong in or whatever like sweet lost sweet James like you can get into that oh yes it was strategic as you are if there's something closely adjacent to it that's a competitor then maybe that ends up actually creating more of an issue so something that's not related to a specific phrase but it's simple just an easy number to remember and you
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you make sure they remember it, then maybe that's actually better than potentially sending it to a competitor. Whereas if it's just a number off and it's, you know, Joe's burger shack, you're not worried about it because he's not going to take your business and they're going to keep trying to figure out who it was instead of go to your competitor.
01:17:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like 1-800-the-law 3, how about that Mark? sure that guy would love it if you did that.
01:17:30 - mark sweet
I'm sure I'm going to sued for that, yeah.
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like it's a totally different number, buddy. 3, 2, am I even saying? Yeah. The next number.
01:17:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I believe in...
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like the price is right strategy of phone numbers.
01:17:47 - mark sweet
I've got one dollar about it. I mean, we do, um, like, sweetlaw.com instead of just sweetlaw.com.
01:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
01:17:58 - mark sweet
No, it was like you just in case someone... misspell sweetlaw.com.
01:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, right.
01:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:18:04 - mark sweet
We also sweet.law. Or whatever that's for it.
01:18:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah.
01:18:14 - mark sweet
Okay. Sweet as you, IT portion is already taken.
01:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that what you have is, is easy enough. Like it really is. Think about all those ear rooms, those jingles, the friggin just repetition that stuff sticks in your head. It's, it's psychology. The human brain is not that complicated. So work with what we know works. Just it's the common seriously big text. It's flashing. Somebody's repeating that number over and over again. It gets in their head. They could be sleeping in the middle of the night and they're repeating that number and they don't know why. That's how the brain works.
01:18:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So,
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:19:01 - mark sweet
You're right. You're absolutely right.
01:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
doesn't matter how good or how about it. It's repetition.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:19:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
if it's a little hooky, it's got to have a little like roll off the tongue.
01:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does because so you've got two sets of zeros, 800, 975, It very much falls in that and it's unique enough. So the repetition, it will get in there subconsciously. I'm telling you. And then if you make sure that you also make the correlation to this is an injury attorney, personal injury, a law firm, know, then it's it's stuck there. It gets into the seps and that's why I'm talking about more than two times a day, that kind of repetition. But whatever, we should be split testing it and we'll be able to test way more than radio ads, billboards or anything else. But we haven't even started this. This is going to be somewhat like I'm talking about a year long path going down here, trying to figure it out. and do it right but I think that we bleed a lot less money doing this. I think we have way more leverage doing this but the first thing we have to do is stop being afraid of what's got to be this it's got to be that it just tapping into human psychology that's what makes marketing great doing it getting data real data not assumed data because somebody else is doing it getting real data and then adjusting our approach based on our real data that's what we should be doing.
01:20:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how to think is like this is also like a 1980 strategy right this is based off of a phone number the letters on the phone like why would you even do that what is what is the new version of that what is the future version of that is it text settlement quote to 965 well that's the other thing I was thinking about is how do we engage a chatbot into these types of things.
01:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that because these people was streaming ads, whatever, do they want, you know, an instant answer? Do they want to have to dial one number? Do they want to have to remember it? Can they remember at Sweet Law now or something like that, where we're somehow the Google search and it gets into a chatbot? I don't know, like, hit us up on Messenger here. And maybe that was on a Facebook ad, hit us up on Instagram messages. And it's on an Instagram map. It, like, TikTok messages, TikTok ads, kublu message, I don't know, maybe it's a phone number, whatever. But that, again, is all the nuance.
01:21:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But first we have to get a framework to get started as a QR code. For sure.
01:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the thing is that here's the two things. So if they're streaming on their TV and they have a QR code on the TV, then you get it with your phone. If they're streaming on their phone and you have a QR code, then you have an issue because they can't scan it with the device. They're watching it, but can it be a clickable QR code with Hulu ads? I don't know, but that's a potential and if that's not available now, I guarantee you it will be down the road very soon because they want advertisers to stay with them and the more engagement they can create for their advertisers, the more money the advertisers will spend, so that's just down the road. So if we're planning for that, if we're positioned to be able to take advantage of those things because we're already on that path, all the more better for us. But either way, being where the people are, that's the whole point of white billboards work. So that is what we should be doing by online.
01:22:49 - mark sweet
Still think the boards still work, we should still be there.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying they don't work, but you want an optimized leverage business and there's competition and dollars matter. So definitely. fine work. Does it get you clients? Yes. Does it get you in the profit margins you want to be? Bet you it doesn't.
01:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's really the time. The time is a totally unknown variable. Like, does it take a year? Does it take two years? Like, how long does it take? And how much the only way to plan that is?
01:23:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. It's going to take at least a year.
01:23:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:23:25 - mark sweet
So you got to stick this in for at least to get it.
01:23:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So but here's the thing Mark. Do you want to work? Do you want something that works? Or do you want something that works at maximum capacity? Optimal leveraged? I thought that was what we were working on.
01:23:44 - mark sweet
I'm interested though in how we build a brand that has more value to getting those. And unfortunately, purely digital does not carry the same way.
01:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that you're making assumptions based off of the world up until this point when the world is something changing and is almost new every year at this point.
01:24:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and the other thing is that brand is, is free of analog or digital brand become brand is branded exists outside those things. And then they translate that brand into an online search, right? So are they brand is losing its power? Brand. But you can brand through both and then the brand is established. So the question is you can build brand through an oppression offline or online. So it's like you get to the same destination of brand.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think brands now is as powerful as your reviews are because that's what people are relying on. Back in the day, it was all word of mouth. We knew what we heard about. And what we heard about was from our friends, whatever, and so that was the power. our branding. But now, everyone, not everyone, but a lot of people go to review sites. So you've already got that game locked down. If you do that, and also are in the location where they are, when they need it, I think that they, I don't know, that we've got to get some research to find out the power of branding. But everything that I've been watching for at least the last five years is suggesting that branding is much less important these days. Unless you're looking at the brand being their reputation online and their reviews.
01:25:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, deep in the vanity shortcuts. Like, how do you get one of these? I don't think I've ever seen a Or he's one of these either.
01:26:01 - mark sweet
Uh, Morgan and Morgan uses pound law.
01:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
01:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what about pound, sweet love or sweet justice?
01:26:11 - mark sweet
love that one. People don't know how to spell on their phones very well. OK. more they try to spell a word, the more likely they are to screw it up because people just keep on them. Numbers now, they don't really, you know, see letters. That's much.
01:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, this is this would be text text my quote to 0, 0, 0, 0.
01:26:38 - mark sweet
Right.
01:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have to spell anything. They're spelling my quote in the SMS message and then the destination is 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, it all is.
01:26:50 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:26:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Until I'm also going to look at the QR codes. This is not going to be far away where they're on a device. device or QR code where you can click that and all of that will be coded into the link that all they have to do is tap it and it opens up the text message or an app with a message that drafts it and all they have to do is click send and it's going with the right word and to the right number or address.
01:27:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not following. I think do that with I think I could do that with leaf glory right now.
01:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's so and that's leverage that's what I'm talking about every friction point that you can remove like you guys are talking about these different games you know branding and it you don't you don't have to win the branding game you don't have to win the billboard game what you need is a certain amount of cases and at a certain value above and beyond what you're at without increasing your payroll costs. That's all you need. We're overcomplicating it but trying to worry about what the competitors are doing. Leverage the technology. That's available to us now. Keep your eyes on your own path, because we have enough data to know that we can do better if we apply it and stop thinking about everybody else.
01:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to go ahead my haircut. Thanks everyone.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be thinking about this a lot, trust me. I would like some Ronin pictures, please, if you have them. I do.
01:28:32 - mark sweet
I need happy pictures. He looks like a stuffed animal.
01:28:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:00:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So I have been doing this blurry thing since I've been doing a lot of, um, Oh gosh, I haven't talked to you, right?
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, for two weeks.
00:00:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh gosh, there's so many things that happen.
00:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do you want to start? Anywhere. Okay.
00:00:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Um, I, I. Oh, we will start on the day that we got that contract and then yeah, and then we had a party that day on and then the next day we like prepared for Japan I'm just trying to do the time like as it feels like a blur I That was about it. That was right around there when we talked we talked Face it 12 is when we got that meeting and then it's marks holiday both party for his His office and then we left the 14 And then we arrived at 15 We're in Tokyo while we are in Tokyo from 14 to 18 or 17 Everything is okay. Then we went to Kyoto the mama We went to Kyoto 18 19 like 19 is when the email starts going coming in I was like what's going on. I guess it's starting now. So I'm very stressed out at that. It's my first time that I had a vacation that I have to work. I never went on a trip that I have to work. I see Mark doing that. thought that my role with Mark is to make sure that he's relaxed and he's in the past. feel bad that he has to work. Now I understand how that feels. But at the same time, I know it's different because I'm just starting and we don't have any, I feel like we don't have anything in place other than the Google sheets. I'm glad that Cheryl actually did that. The Google sheets where she's just start like putting the patient's name, the date of birth. It's like very basic and they just hire her daughter to be part of, they call it lean department, which I'm leading, I guess, managing. It was built for me, basically, like, and she was just hired on the 11th, 12th, he's like very new. was scrambling, like, I'm so the stress level, I cannot even express how it is, although I try my best to enjoy my time there, which I did because it's in the morning and then from after 9 o'clock, we go around and 9 a.m.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I'm done with my notes and stuff.
00:03:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
try to – and Mark is there, which is – I think that, again, everything happens for a reason. Mark is right there with me and looking at the way I chart and telling me, like, okay, this is a good to go, was able to send in, but the orders were not sent because the – the triplicate that I was saying is It's for narcotics. The one that was actually stolen to part of the stolen stuff. So the triplicate And that's like another thing we'll talk later, but it's where we write MRI orders like MRI of the server neck I'm right, but you know back, but we don't need that. We don't need the triplicate We just need a regular paper with the doctor's name and signature Which I'm very happy that we did actually just two days ago or three days ago With mark mark help me that I think I sent it to you. I'm not sure I'm not sure if I did.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know anymore.
00:04:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So what it's like a check-up order that if I see it So you know how that yeah, there's so many things that happen in this But we're focusing on the business, right? There's so many things that I There's days that I remember when we went to Tokyo again or she's she no go-ha mom. I think mark and I I'm having some arguments because I don't even remember why, but I think I'm just very stressed out, but it's like, and that's when I think you hurt me, I cry and like, um, the voice message, I feel, it's like a make-up break-y moment, like, can I really do this? But then in hindsight, like, you know, it's really okay, I just have to keep on going.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:33 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So we're averaging, as of right now, I wanted to tell you exactly how much patient came in, who, including, like, holidays, right? There's two holidays and excluding weekend, I guess. But we have 32 patients from, where are you? Okay, we have 32 patients for it's like averaging four to five patients a day that I see that's a hundred a month which is amazing like our goal is 400 right but having 25% of the way there and about that is that is just crazy and I know this month is huge and I know obviously I won't be able to get this without Mark and his connection and the owner of sweet James is he he was in our wedding with us together like he knows us but he doesn't know me he's not Mark but he's been I don't know if Mark told he's been trying to get Mark back to work with him which he doesn't want to now but if there is a relationship and I am very stressed out I'm making sure that I don't it up because of Mark like I don't want him to I think that's initially where my thought process went is I don't want to embarrass him but at the same at the time, like, this is on me, like, Dr. E just doesn't, like, he just, like, I need not in any way, like, other than me calling him, like, hey, a situation, there's this patient, is this okay, like, I'm thinking to do this. So he's there when I call him. But he does not, he's not part of day to day seeing patients documenting nothing. So right now, the process, can I tell you the process is, I know, I feel like it's a lot because I'm doing the main part, but I'm going to give it to Bella next week.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Before you tell me that, the thing I want you to think about is, what would you have to do to consider something really being messed up? So let's break this down for a minute. There's a few different things. Number one, you could do something that gets a patient killed. We know that's not going to happen, right? We know. you're not going to do that. That's you have that expertise. You're not going to hurt somebody. You could not see somebody in time and something bad happens to them. We also know that's not going to happen, Jonah, right? It's not the way you operate. It's not going to happen. That's really the only thing that could actually be the biggest messes up is that something happens to the client that's detrimental. The worst thing that could happen is you don't get notes done in time. You miss something in the note, but I don't think you would miss anything that's detrimental, right? It could be something that maybe doesn't help them when the case is much. So, but that is huge in error and that's going to happen a percentage of the time with just about anybody. So the odds that you would make a mistake that is like absolutely unacceptable. I don't believe it's something that you can or would do. So you are going to make mistakes and sometimes it may cost somebody something, but I promise you that everybody that they work with including themselves make those types of mistakes. Mark makes those mistakes very rarely, but they happen. Sweet James, everybody in there is going to make those types of mistakes. So what they're going to do to evaluate that, right? Like I said, unless you did something that's like a detrimental life or death to the client, they're going to look at that and go, that really sucks. Jonah and they're probably going to yell or whatever and then get it out and then put it in perspective and go, yeah, but she shows up every day. She can take the feedback. She doesn't something wrong. I need to make a mistake. I need to be corrected on a mistake. And then she keeps improving. So they're not going to measure you according to the mistake that you made. They're going to. It will feel like that in the moment. That's what it feels like when we make mistakes. That's all we can think about.
00:10:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's all we feel.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then, because of the nature of their business, they have to learn how to put things in a perspective. Keep people. There aren't a lot of people that can do what you do. There's competition and there are a significant amount, but they don't all show up. They don't all break really good notes. They do not all have really notes. It's not all timely. And they don't all meet their patients, love them like yours do. So, your value is going to buy you some leniency, if and when you do make your mistakes. You can't mess this up so bad that marks reputation is completely tamed. Whatever mistakes you will make and you will make them, they will not be detrimental. to mark in his relationship. Even if he gets stressed out and think that that's a possibility, it's not going to happen because Mark has a tendency to worry and stress too much as well. But he's also really good at putting it back in perspective and go, you know what, it'll be what it'll be. But if you two feed off of each other, stress moment, then those are going to be periods of animosity. what you need to do is say, you know what, I need the mark that says everything's going to be okay. Because I know you have that in you. That's what he is. When I'm sitting there and he's told me something bad that's happening, oh, I feel sorry. I feel like a mama and I just want to be like, how can I make it better? And he'll be like, but everything will be okay. I'm like, well, like I know you how I have to go there because I'm normally like, does he ever tell you what my nickname is for him?
00:11:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
No.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or you want to know why every time we would get on the call like how you doing I'm like what is wrong with you I was just so like two years later I'm like I'm just gonna call you E or because and now he is very cognizant of not showing up that way he didn't like it but he also wasn't you know a child about it he kind of realized that I said it for a reason I didn't say it to insult him or degrade him I said it because that's not helpful it's just not if you want to be unhappy then focus on the things that aren't great and it's not that he doesn't have real hard things going on you know but we have to like I've told you we have to focus on what we want to grow so if you want the good things to grow you have to focus on on, on what growth. So, but what happens is, so I heard something probably about 10 years ago that shifted me. I like, I feel like crying again, just thinking about it, because I thought about how much I did it, how much my family did it, how much most people did it. And that is that we give our best manners and behavior to complete strangers and everyone other than our family. And we say, well, it's because our family, they can handle the real us, and we can be ourselves. But what they mean is, I can be rude, I can be snappy, I can be short because I'm in a bad mood. What really should happen is we give our best to the people that we love the most, our most politeness, our most good, you know, our greatest amount of respect. And we should hold our tongues and master our tongues better around the people that we love. And this is like I can cut somebody down in half with my words in half a second and put them for decades. And I used to be proud of that. And it's a terrible thing. I was proud of it because I was hard a lot and I only did it to mean people and it wasn't okay because it came out a lot. And I realized I really have to think about my words. Because I'm clever and witty, I could say really hurtful things, not even just thinking I'm joking. I'm funny. Not funny. I've watched marriages be destroyed over that kind of stuff. So when it comes to like the worry and the stress and the fear and the pressure, you guys have to remember that you have to give each other your best. Like if this was an employee or this was a best friend, what would you say? to them. How would you use your words then? Our parents, children, spouses, they should get our very, very, very best. And it's really hard to do sometimes. But I think that the two of you can have the most powerful support of each other because I know that you love each other and I know you believe in each other and I know that you like working together. So if you can figure out how to read each other when you need different things, when you need that support and you need that encouragement. And if you can tell yourself, this is the person that gets me through everything, I need to not hurt him. He needs to not hurt you. Not that you've never do it intentionally. We do it accidentally. That's my whole point, is we just, we're in our homes and we let our guards down, but what that can can mean is we also let ourselves react in ways that really we shouldn't. And that's us backwards. Because I think that your greatest strength is going to be, at least when it comes to this business stuff, is marked. And likewise, that's what I think about families, you're going to be able to get through all of this stuff. And I think another thing that would be good. So you've got me, but if there are other women, so just kind of like raise up your antenna to notice like when you meet a woman, maybe at an event or something, and you feel like you kind of click with her, and maybe like you have either similar or complementary personality types and things.
00:16:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have two right now.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, that is awesome.
00:16:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
The one is a, she's younger than she's, she's so much her. I, we, oh. These two women are connected because of love of luxury, so that's how we connected the other. The one woman she's in for, she has an Airbnb, she's the eldest, so it's a family business that kind of handed on to her, so she's ever since, she's very mature, she's basically doing Airbnb business. And the other one, she's Japanese, has a, I don't understand fully her business, but I talked to them and I did ask the Japanese, she's a little reserved, she's, that's how her personality is, but both of them really just told me, because what do you do when you feel like you don't, you want to feel like keep on going? And they said, and you feel overwhelmed, and then they, both basically say the concept is just to keep on going, keep on working. So I wanted to tell you this, this past two weeks. I cried a lot. And because I feel overwhelmed, some Mark saw, some Mark, he didn't, like this Monday, he's, we push our buttons intentionally. I mean, unintentionally, like, I asked his help about this order set. I said, can I see a sample of your doctors, you just have to redact the names and the things. I just need to see how they order stuff because we cannot use the triple kit on all time because we're not prescribing narcotics. We're just recommending physical therapy and get an MRI. So he showed me a checklist and he has, he helped me do it from something to Adobe. And I'm technologically challenged. I mean, I just can't, I don't do them. But anyway, he's so. He's helping me and he's very frustrated because he's also in pain. I don't know, he told me I was pain on his knee and he's very snappy and I said, it's okay, just eat first and I know he's very rare mark with that snack, but he can.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pain will, pain makes everything go out the door because and then I said, it's okay, I told him it's okay, just eat or whatever, but he wants to do it for me.
00:19:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
He knows, I need, he knows I need it. So he's very snappy with me and then I just started crying, but I keep on working. Like I got his own, he can't see, we cry and I just keep on working. I'm not crying more because of how he is.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know he's in pain frustrated. That's all for a while, it's a relief.
00:19:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's a frustrating part that I don't know how to do it myself, that I will always see.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and to help me like I don't want that in general. Do you want me to teach you things?
00:20:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I just I definitely feel like I need the how to edit the things because right now it's more work because I have to input each. I don't know how to share. I want to show you what I'm seeing. Can I go there and share? What do I do?
00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, click share and then you can either choose we know.
00:20:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I click sharing your screen sharing. Can you see it? Yes. this this is the right now. This is the in case the Cheryl started and then we input stuff. example, a patient's name and the date of injury and birth and the priority. That's what she did. This is not me. This is just all her and and status. So when we have an email, we put. situation's same birthday and the status I put scheduled and This is my note supposedly and this is Bella's note And who's the case manager? So we're this is what she did and I think it's nice. I think it's okay. I'm sure eventually But so far we're at 32 32 and she put other liens here for me from other Which I haven't inputted anything yet. I haven't put inputted the last the last ones I got This is the lead She shared me the charges Oh Okay, she shared these are the charts so now I'm doing the billing because I want To to do this first, I know it's going to be more work, but I'm doing the buildings. So this is the billing and this is this is the orders right now. Okay, I have to input each name here, copy, paste the name here, put the birthday, put the address, put the date that I ordered it.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the one that Mark did for me. So check that I kind of pick and choose which ones leave behind.
00:22:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then this is the black one. I added this and I removed some stuff. This is like three texts. And then the electronic signature is already there. So I have to do this each and every once. I feel like it's tedious. I want to integrate eventually here. This is our this is our charting system. So later on, once Dr. E arrive from Australia, and then once I get back from Paris, I guess I want to integrate here when are you guys leaving and coming back so we're I'm well Right now. It's it's still continue. I think we should continue. I mean our life should continue I know I just want to know because it does I know I'm sorry. I meant because it's I feel like it's still I've hung up in the air like I don't know how mark feels how his mom feels because it's his mom's birthday Oh, but if it ever it's January Not at nighttime of January night.
00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what a week Okay, and then how long will you be gone?
00:23:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think the 18 or 17.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay It's a week. Yeah So Yeah, do you want me to stop? Yeah, I just want to tell you something really quick and then I keep keep going but the the way that a I have evolved this year. A lot of this stuff, you probably will be able to integrate and put together. The limitation is that anything that has to be HIPAA compliant is going to be slower than the rest of the stuff. But lots of people want this, so this will happen quickly. you will run your business best when you understand how everything works. it will be best for you to gather the skills and to get them because you'll be better at hiring and managing the people who help you in the future if you know how to do it yourself. So the way that I want you to kind of always think about it is when there's something to be done, it's um I do it and that's you, right? That's you and the person that you're hiring and then it's you do it. So I do what we do what you do it. So you always learn how to do it first, then you do it together and then you have them do it and then you just watch from time to time. And that just, like I said, just makes sure that you understand, it also helps us to not overburden somebody. It's very easy to hire somebody and think, that's really easy. You should be done by now, but when you've done it, you have a little more respect for who you're hiring and who you're managing.
00:25:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I wanted to tell you, like I talked to well on Monday Tuesday, like I called her, I said, and talked to her even when I was in Japan, we did a like a FaceTime with Cheryl, her and I, and then now we've been talking separately, like I told her I want you, I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, I know she's new, this is, I'm trying to, you know, obviously the sense of ownership will eventually be up to her, but I wanted to include her, like on everything, said both of us are starting this, so I don't want you to feel it. I basically call her, I'm always here, but anyways what I'm doing now and you tell me if this is wrong, is I want her to listen to how I
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
call the patient.
00:26:01 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm trying to tell her how the process is. The first process is when the email comes in. Our goal is to make sure that we call the patient and set an appointment right away. And I will tell her that in 30 minutes, 30 minutes each patient, these are the block of hours. want you to schedule for me. I have yet to email her dad. supposed email that yesterday for her because we just talked. Of course, I wasn't able to do that. But that was my plan is to tell her, for example, from Monday to Friday, these are the block of times I want you to fill them up with patients. So that's my plan. And we weren't able to do it with one patient yesterday, wherein he can hear how I talked to the patient, how I made this schedule. And I just have to write it down. have yet to write it down. So I told her from the email comes in, call the patients, put them on our Google drive your information, start the chart on our software and then send a zoom link meeting. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. Sorry. I have to write it down.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But she, I told the first assignment. Okay. Tell me I'm going to write it down. Okay. What happened first?
00:27:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So first is when the email comes, I told her to, I guess, put it in the Google drive. I want her to have her own flow, but I told it put it the Google drive, call the patient, set up an appointment based on the block time I gave you in 30 minutes, fill it up and set up appointment based off the blocks that I have yet to give her. But yeah, box schedule and 30 minutes at a time. now, eventually I'll get faster. I actually added something, I told her while you're on the phone with the patient, send the lean agreement, the electronic lean consent agreement, which she actually did and she just finished it. Because I told her I need this, the first time I talked to her last week while I honest, I did ask her that we're both learning the Adobe, I guess, that you all don't like the part we're in after they sign. Something is sent to their email and they have to verify that first. So she's trying to see if we can remove that because if a patient elder is patient, how do they go back and forth to the go back to the email and verify like we're trying to make it because because it's an electronic signature, you may not be able to get around that because there has to be something.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and kind of verification that the person signing is the correct person.
00:29:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now what I've been doing is sending the PDF scan document which is actually like sent it and I told the patient to sign it and give it to me and they're actually giving it back to me.
00:29:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they can even with Adobe they can print it from their wet signature and bring it to you if you want that.
00:29:25 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean email the email is back to me.
00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know but I'm saying if you want to skip the authentication where they're not signing they can probably just print it. You can have an email to them where they print it, wet signature, bring it back. So but one of the others is going to have to happen because it is a authentication. The whole point of a signature is authentication.
00:29:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So yeah so that's something that we're trying to work on. In the meantime I'm giving them a PDF form. It's not assignable. It's just seen the patient printed, they've been printing it and writing it in pen. So that's because 99, I would say 95% of these patients or 99, the first meeting is video like Dr. Fuji. Unless we're going to do procedure, that's the time that will come to the clinic. So I told her while you're on the phone, do the send them after you schedule them, send them the lien document to sign and send it before or after. You know, we're trying to be flexible with them. And then thirdly, I want you to ask a simple medical and surgical history. And I have yet to write it down for us. That's actually what keeps me the time on my 30 minutes with them.
00:30:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have those questions?
00:30:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I have those questions.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, are they in your head or are they right now? Okay, tell me.
00:31:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So basically I asked do you have any medical history sometimes they say oh I'm fine I'm healthy but the next question is do you take any medication regularly oh I said oh yeah I'm taking cholesterol medication so you have high cholesterol so it's just oh but I'm fine now well you're fine because you're not cholesterol medical but anyways I'm trying to teach her how to get that information so I need the medical and surgical history that's it the rest I will ask I just need those two for you to write it down and then I'll figure it out later and maybe there is a way that will be easier for her maybe just a checkup or type I'm not entirely sure what else currently in the in our current charting system it is um maybe I should just tell her to open create the chart open the note open a note and because She's part of the note that's checklist, but she has to look for it, you know? I don't know if it's going to be harder for her. easier for her to type, but I thought about it. She's not a medical drink. She does not have a medical background. So if a patient tells her, oh, I I don't know, carpal tunnel repair or something like that. She may not know how to spell it, and I don't want her to film. So I'm trying to see what's going to This is very easy.
00:32:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it's a spelling thing, you just literally go at, if she has Siri or Google, ask, how do you spell carpal tunnel? Right. So you don't actually need to, you can look it up and Google picks it too, but either way, she can just ask that.
00:32:46 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It is better to ask and then check off on our checkup system on our chart, patient's charts that she can, once you open new notes, there is a checkup there. Yeah.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so, so think about Oh, what you get when you go to a new doctor, they ask you all of this medical history. They ask you if you have any known allergies to medications.
00:33:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's going to be something that's important for you.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking any current medications?
00:33:14 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
you want to make sure that you don't have any. So actually for us, the only medication that because with the lean patients, I there's only one that I prescribe medications, but the prescribing medications is kind of. What's the term? I avoid it for lean patients. Yeah, we reach for some reason that was the practice, but I don't like narcotics. don't like Fuji does not give their heart. He will probably give some muscle relaxants, but not narcotics, right? for my health insurance, chronic pain, every month patients, I give narcotics to them. So for me, It's like, yeah, so it's very, very rare, and the other thing is if we're going to do an epidural, I will ask, are you on blood thinners? And I have some very specific question because those are the ones that will affect the procedure. So, I mean, again, I'm trying not to make Bella a work a lot because I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, but I need those two.
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need medical history. That's not the way to do this, the right person for you is the one that helps you the amount that you need. So, it's not your job to worry about if they're overwhelmed. It's your job to find out if they can handle the job. Does that make sense?
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's still hard for me to grasp the concept because my mentality is I want to be a part of it rather than, I don't know what the term.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're delegating your application. don't want to have the you want to delegate. But you thinking about the entire process, and you should be reviewing all the notes, it won't take you nearly as long to read them as it will for you to put them in. So, and whether you read them all, although I would, because you're accountable for all of them, it's saving you time to have her input everything, but you're still reviewing it. And from time to time, so she'll be on calls with patients asking these information, right?
00:35:35 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, so that when she get, like I said, when she get, I was trying to tell her the steps, so when she get the email, call the patients, and this is what I want her to start doing, like just ask for medical and surgical history.
00:35:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what we'll be in email, right?
00:35:55 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, when the email comes, I told her it's very important, our response time. You know, it's fast. I told her once we get it, put in Google Drive the information, call the patient set up an appointment based on that time frame of 30 minutes. And then while on the phone, help them send the, what do you call that, the electronic consent patient. So we will need patient's email. So there's actually nothing on the Google Drive with the patient email, may have to add that. Because right now I'm just writing it on my notes as I talk to them. So I have it on my phone notes. So, and then I said that I told her to set up, while you're setting up the schedule, initially I told her, you can have access on my Zoom link. And then Cheryl said, why are you assuming we have a Gmail? count that can do that for you. There's like a zoom meeting, like a meeting. And the Google Meet. And she said it's HIPAA compliant. I know Mark told me that the zoom is HIPAA compliant. But again, I think it's okay. She told me she's okay. So I'm going to start telling Bella to start doing it on Google Meet and then start plugging in schedules there. For right now, 30 minutes per patient, eventually I'm going to get faster and do 20 or 15 minutes each patient, which is the standard anyways. So right now it's two patients an hour, but the goal is to do four patients an hour and be faster and so if I do Yeah, so I mean, four times, yeah, if I do four patients an hour in four hours, I can have 80 patients a week. That is very close to getting 400 a month, like that's very doable, like if I just do four-hour patients, like, and this is just California, like I haven't even touched it later on in the Washington, like it's actually perfect timing, like you said, everything I need to hone is done. Everything that I do now will prepare me for Washington. So yeah, I don't know if it's a check-off is better or hurt.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Typing let's let's let's just say this. Um, template. We're going to call it template. Um, So, let's do one. Let's think about this. Let's. Where's my undo thing? We moved the alert is. Um, what did you do that? Oh, that's why. Okay. Okay. let's see. You It's one one No, I'm just giving an example date. I know what it is So that we want to highlight this because this is the very first up like dude, okay, then put Singing into patient like there's a folder it's called Thomas lean Yeah That's what the folder name is, Chona's Lean, Chona's Lean Case, Chona's Lean Case is actually So yeah, I mean Okay, so let's see Let me think about the exact water I forgot to put water Oh, that cough. It's crazy how long coughs can linger. There's some new things in here that's pretty cool. I'm just trying to think of, so here's what we're going to do. Because you can have one doc that is a checklist with instructions that has all of this. But then you can also have a template that she just saves a copy and fills out. I think that that's probably the better thing to do is create a checklist and she can either open it or print it off. The thing with printing off is if you go and make an update, then she's got an old copy. So anytime you update, you say shred the one you've got, make a new one, print it up.
00:43:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean, the checklist for her when I mean, came, it comes in.
00:43:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like, right. So we could have one thing that's a checklist, right? That says, these are all the things you're gonna get. And then the other thing is an actual document that's got all of that stuff in it.
00:43:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, no, we're thinking of writing it on that temporary document that this one she created a, she can all this, she can all do this in the form. It's a matter of obviously being fast. It's like, she put the pages on the Google Drive. Whatever. For her flow is eventually, she will eventually have her flow, but I want this all done and I want her to create a chart, creating a chart needs name, birthday, and she can put the address later. When she created a patient's chart, she can open a note or a memo for non provider for non doctor non NPE staff, and they can write whatever they want, they can they can free text. So that's what I was thinking of, where to put the medical and surgical history, either a memo or either open a chart where in, there's a check off. have, I do want me to show you.
00:44:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:44:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay.
00:44:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me stop. Sure. There you go.
00:44:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
How do I? Okay. Share. Share. Okay. Okay. So. This is our thing. For example, I'm going to do a test. Yes. 10. test. So she could this is a new chart, for example, the patient, she can put under here notes, either create memo, or where she can free write, this is what memo looks like. And I can just write like that, you can save it, or do a new patient form. But this is not the note that I use for liens. The note that I use for liens is so, because the soap is just very simple. So these are minus the medication. Think about the medication, but I did objective, objective, and there's nothing in here about medical, surgical history. So I don't know which one is better for her.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's probably you should have both. Like, you. This is the thing, it does not matter what business we're starting with, does not matter what business I'm working with, people have a tendency to want to do less work, thinking that somehow that's better.
00:46:16 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So this is, I want to show you, this is the new note, this is our note for health regular health insurance and this one right here PMHX primary medical history. So when you click this, it's like a check off box.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so all the patients, for all the diseases, and then you can also free type here.
00:46:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, and then she can save it. But the thing is, if she do that, then I have to open this.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not combine them? Can you not create a whole new form that combines both of them?
00:46:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, you can. So like for example, So this one, I will open soap, because that's what I use for liens, this one right here is called soap note that will integrate this note that I just did. However, it's not going to copy the medical history, because the soap note does not have a medical center.
00:47:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, what I'm saying is, as like a template form, so like in your dropdown menu, you have all these different options, right? So note is one of them, right? All of those, what I'm saying is, can, and you may have to ask what the name of the company is, what is that? Can you make me a form that combines soap with with medical history? Yes, because then you have it all in one file, all right, so you're not opening multiple things. I don't see why they wouldn't do that for you.
00:47:56 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, that would be I'll be making. Oh, also. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Um, you can, you can actually do this. No, how do I? Okay. You can do this one. I can create my own notes. It's just macros that I don't know how to do this. Cheryl just told me this the other day. He's like, this is mine and I can create.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So look, this is, I'm going tell you the fastest way to do this. Go click on the, the help, the question mark at the top of the menu. Um, in the blue, top right of the screen, like by your account.
00:48:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Over little bit more right here.
00:48:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. on that. Scroll down. All the way down.
00:48:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think this one took place. The list of template. I don't need to. I don't That's, I don't want that. This one. No types. This is what she told me. Customize a list of no types. And there's like a macro.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just show you real quick because I don't know if this is what you show me. I'm going to hold on. going to go Google something. How do I combine notes, type templates in Deborah?
00:49:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Here create template. Is this one right here? But then it's macro. Like I don't know this title.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, the title is Chona's notes or something like that.
00:49:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You can just do lean notes. Okay. I guess me. And version one.
00:49:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:49:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
then I don't know what's next.
00:49:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, uh,
00:50:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I, this, this is what I don't know why I know it's very, um, my, it's macro. So I, they told me to, how about I'll just add stuff at a section or at a care plan. I just have to play around with it. So at a section, maybe, um, don't know, is there a drop down menu? Uh, no, uh, there. Oh, it, these are like the, the, what's already being used to exam in detail. don't know if this is correct, exam gen detail.
00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Click on that and see what happens.
00:50:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Uh, save, just go save and see what happens. Can you just add that there? Um, yeah, I think this is like, more, I can call the customer service and that's what I would do. And then, um, I'm going to tell you, like this,
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People resist calling support or getting support. It is the fastest way to get exactly what you want.
00:51:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It will save you hours of frustration. That's what happened. That's why I was able to get the um remember the able to this is the the system where I was able to give electronic prescription. This was the problem. Yeah. then the other doctor who came at this and the new doctor came in at the same time with me. He still cannot. It's only with already been mine.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You go to the expert. If you need something, you go to the expert. Their support knows their software. And if they won't do it for you, say, do you have um affiliate like like a partner agency that I can hire who can go do this for me? For sure. All you want to do all you like there are two forms that are exactly what you want.
00:51:49 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You just need to merge them, right? Right. And this one, I need this exactly this one. of me writing the name Databrit, I just all like, you know, manually. So what I mean, these are my annually copying the name and this is so much work. want this to be integrated in that system.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you give them like have a copy that has what you want and that doesn't have any patient information say, I need soap, I need this, I need this. I need them in one form. Please make it for me or tell me who I can hire to have it made for me.
00:52:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. Because these are all like electronic everything is done.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said, hold on a second. Do they have a um, Tebrat? Does Tebrat have email or help? That's support. Once again.
00:52:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I hope this. Yeah, I believe so. That's that. That's how I called. did both.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did help this and call. Yeah. Yeah, I would just call him today is New Year's Day. So they're probably not open but tomorrow Chona. I would. I really want you to be accountable to do this thing because it's going to make your life so much easier. Yeah. I want you to commit to me to call them tomorrow and ask them for this.
00:53:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Will you do that? Yeah, I need to do this. I need to call them for this. And in the meantime, I think for Bella, she can just type it whatever, however she understood.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would also tell her I'm going to have somebody build this for us. So it's just going to be all in one so that she knows you're proactively doing this. Just, of course, thank her like, you know, like this. Yeah, I'm really grateful that you're here to help with this. This is stressful. And I'm going to make sure that it's as easy for both of us and that we enjoy doing the work.
00:53:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
What do you think of this one so far? Like what how Cheryl did this is what we're doing right now. I'm just copy casing it. And I'm just putting my notes here.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's a good start. But the thing that I love about CRM type The thing database like Deborah is that you you probably have a better search function a reporting function It's going to be a lot easier to print out for the attorneys for you to be able to send them the documents And so what I do is after there's a document here.
00:54:15 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's so easy. I just download it Then I send it I copy the building is also done here. It's very I already took over those which is actually very good I think Cheryl and I already got into this space where I'm not there to take her day I'm there to make sure it's not a lot of work for her So I think we're there Within this sort of we're there like she was also text because I told her about what happened and she's very And I think we're okay. I understand how she is. I think she understand what I need and it clicked right away like Yeah, so I think we're good in terms of that because it's so easy for her to give out and remember before she's like No, let us do the building.
00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But now he's like, okay, this one, he showed me how to do it.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, share me the charges. So, well, and if you bring them into the age of technology and simplifying things where they've got everything they maybe knew they should have been doing but weren't doing because it was too hard, they're going to love you for it. And the more the longer you're there, the safer Cheryl will feel.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you kind of got to bear down on all of this and know that I love the scripture that says you shall know that by their fruits. most people don't think about things like that, but we do measure people like that. We measure what's happening. So, fear is natural and it's going to happen. But when a person just keeps showing up consistently, good constantly, being helpful constantly, like eventually you're like, you know what, that person's good because you get the same kind of fruit all the time. know what I mean?
00:55:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And they saw me work well, I was in Japan that I, you know, when I talked to them, I was did you kind of be huge. They saw the work and she told me like, no, I you're much better to work with. Dr Lee, so hard to get him to do things for me.
00:56:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, they're going to love you, first of all, because you're just able to love. But yeah, but that's why though, Chona is because you have such a good heart, but you also show up and and you work. So it's not just you have a good heart and I wish things were nice.
00:56:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You have a good heart and you roll up your sleeves and get to work to make it nice. Right.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll definitely.
00:56:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. And I told them, no, I fully, I know the gravity. I'm not taking this lightly. I am full on it. I can't believe how fast I can do the note. No, it's got to keep getting better.
00:56:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, is there's going to be a tipping point where like, okay, you can get better.
00:57:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay, it was not perfect. Obviously, like when I was a little gentler coming in this past couple of days, I have you know that are like not done. But the essentials, like the case manager, by the way, I just want to tell you real quick, there's a case manager there that we are like, we are in sync. I asked her, I told her, like, you know, I want to know, I don't want to bother, you know, I was like, I actually like you're very responsive. You know, that's like, okay, that's a good feedback. So it's easy for us to like text each other, call each other. And so, so far, you know, she's she's just one department. And she's her department, the one that's giving me like all of this. And I am, I don't know, that's the combination of stress and excitement at the same time. But I feel good. I like the idea that if I travel, I can still make have some money and
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're crazy. I love that. I go on trips and because of the way that I've got my business, I've spent 22 plus years working on. So what I work on is making sure that I keep learning the highest value thing. So I keep learning new technology. I keep learning new systems and new automations so that I can keep saving people more time, more energy, so that they can make more money. So I get paid really well for it, This is what you're doing. leveraging your expertise to be like this.

Nursing is one thing, but nursing and managing lean patients for attorneys is a whole new ball game. So because number one, I get paid really well and because it's all zoom and emails and whatnot, I can take it anywhere.
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, any world and because I'm not doing it time. Once you don't work, I can still enjoy wherever I go. Even if I still work on vacation, it's maybe a couple hours a day and the rest of the time.
00:59:08 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, which is the day. Yeah, it's a life I choose all day, every day.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would rather have that than like this nine to five where I can only take a couple weeks off.
00:59:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I can go on vacation any time I want. And I told Dr. E already, there is the hospital, you know, I still wanted to continue for now. I definitely like the hospital setting, the hospital patients. But I already kind of told him that the Monday to Tuesday between 1.30 to 4.00 or 4.30 that I'm there. Seeing patients in the clinic, sometimes they give me 20 and only 10 show up.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I feel like that's not a good use of my time.
00:59:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And I told him, I'd rather have the telemedicine patients because I can still be. calling them and still take care of the link patients and the hospital patients. So eventually I have to let go of that afternoon set time. Like I, although I don't know, I'm still in the works on end. So I don't know what the right thing to do, although Cheryl thinks a Thursday afternoon specifically for me because right now the office is in the afternoon on Thursday, they want to open that up specifically for me, lean, not just my lean, but also take care of these lean patients.
01:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so always remember that you're the architect, but in this balance where you're unsure, just keep showing up even if it's not optimal for a while because what happens is there comes this breaking point, this tipping point where you you've and it's usually a very stressful period where you're kind of balancing this act and then you let this thing go because you're already got this thing. What happens is most people want to jump to this thing after it shows up without this being stressful. It's not like that. You basically end up having both at the same time before you let it go. So you'll be really full, really busy and go, okay, this doesn't make any sense anymore. And then in terms of like explaining what you're doing and why you want to do it because I think sometimes you struggle with the yeah, but you know I need to be there to help him whatever. Always remember that you're not like anybody else. You're not employee. You're not his nurse, right? You are here as a profit partner. Always remember this profit partner. You're a profit partner. Okay, so your role is you came here to make money for both of you as optimized as possible. the way that you optimize for him, you're making Cheryl better. You're making his this better. He's already giving you that feedback. Okay, but the cost of that to him is you don't get the bottleneck me having me be at the hospital and not filling up my time. But now you don't say it that way, right? But that's what I need you to understand is that because of the gift that you give, you also get to give that to yourself. You don't get to give him all the blessings and take care of all the business and just take all the burden off of him, right? And then let burden be put on you in reciprocity.
01:02:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That doesn't make any sense. So actually, remember, I remember you asked me what's my ideal schedule? I'm thinking, I'm thinking in my head right now, what I can see is go to the hospital early. I need to knock that off early. Um, either I'm still deciding, you know, I know I need to be consistent either go there at six thirty or seven o'clock and be done. acts an hour and rounding my patients and then go back home and start my day in the morning and this is right now the morning is for my telemedicine patients but eventually once Washington started I want the morning but again obviously I want something doesn't mean that it's gonna be perfect I want that to be the time and then in the afternoon will be the lean patients here and then I'm going oh it may not be perfect but you being really specific about what you want gives you the best chance of getting exactly what you want what I have noticed is that number one that that is true period but what will happen is the Tina today that's making that plan and that vision will get right up to there and go oh now that I'm here and experiencing this it could be even better right but
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wouldn't have known that until I'd gotten to that point. So keep doing that, keep figuring out, you know what, this would probably work best. And then know that you're not going to know if it's best until you've lived it and allow yourself to continually be fluid, changing shape according to whatever is happening.
01:04:18 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now that's, that is definitely what's happening. And I'm actually, I actually want, I just realized Wednesday, because I know we set the time. And this is the time for like prime time for my patients.
01:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like, it is because they're here. You know that because you're here, right? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
01:04:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're like, Oh, now that I see like from 11 to three to four, like those are the times that I've been setting up my patients. But I don't know if it's because I'm adjusting it on my Japan time. But now that I'm, yeah, seriously. And now that I'm Here, I remember scheduling a patient, yes, Monday from 12 and 12 p.m. onwards. So, you know, I guess the reason why I'm saying that is because we have one meeting. So if I give block time to Bella, like, do you need to change your time? Is that what you're saying? I don't know. Or do I, do you be in So the brain have a break.
01:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what the So, I mean, I keep a pretty light schedule on purpose with some flexibility, but I also don't have a ton. Like, I have a certain amount of window, but we can figure out something probably. So whether it's a different day that it does infect things or different time, we can figure it out.
01:05:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But it has to, yeah, you tell me, you know, which day and so if you were to create the schedule, wanted right now.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One time. would you be able to meet on what days?
01:06:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think if I am. I think I just don't want to discount the 12 o'clock time because some of the patients are working and that they're but without without worry.
01:06:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you were not worried about what Tina thought or anybody else thought and if you could do it ideally, what would you do?
01:06:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
For our meeting? Yeah, right. OK, I like the Wednesday, the middle of the week. I I'm really thinking, I really don't know. Well, here's between 11 to one. Like that time period, like 11 to 12 or I'm not sure. think that would be the time because I've noticed I'm start I'm putting in patients 12 o'clock.
01:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I have mission meetings from nine o'clock to 10 and 10 to 11. So I would become so every other week is my 10 to 11. So on some of those days, I won't probably be as mentally prepared as I am. But okay, as long as we're talking well and we're doing our good work, it won't matter. Just know that like normally what I do is create a lot of buffer space before call so that I'm sitting here.
01:07:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm looking at all your notes. It's fresh in my mind.
01:07:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if I if you want to just do 30 minutes or you think an hour, it's a question. Well, it depends on what you need. If if sometimes a half an hour might be okay, but for the most part an hour. And you know, also it depends on how much we're talking throughout.
01:08:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
week.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, like you and I sometimes were texting a lot and that can be enough. It depends on your need. I don't ever want you to feel like I needed more and you don't get it.
01:08:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Like right now, and I'm not worried about it because there's stuff to catch up on and we need to do.
01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I won't have any calls after that. So it would be only you needing to run to go get to a patient.
01:08:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
If you wanted more time, I'd be able to give that to you. Right. Okay. So is it between 11 to 12? Okay.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could do that. Yes. And also because my mission meetings are not, they're not like my work stuff. They're, they're training, but they're not, they're not draining at much slower pace. I'm not the one mentally creating everything and stuff like that. it's not, it's not a burden. I really enjoy them. They're a, ooh, emotions, a blessing.
01:09:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, good. And maybe that's great. Perfect then. So that way I can get the secondary energy from it. There's so much things that are happening. And I'm very glad that we were able to catch up because I feel like, I don't know if you can feel it like so much. It's like, I feel like I'm just vomiting with the stuff that happened. And I do, I think I'm gonna try to, you know, succinctly because I'm not, I know I'm not a good story color, but I would succinctly say that now it felt good. It felt good to have that account locked in. I know this is a trial period, this first month. I know that. That's what's very important throughout the past few days. We already figure out like what work, what doesn't work. Like the, the, the triplicates, I already said this is not gonna work. We can't do every patient every order like this. So we did the checklist, which is really great. Everything is in there. And then the lean is being digitalized, which is great. And then I learned from the case manager, she told me what's important for them because every firm, I guess, is different. For them, what's important, that checklist prescription that I just showed you. The notes and the billing is not as important for them. They're like, that could be days later.
01:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't care.
01:10:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Such kind of, in a way, put a little bit of a pressure with myself because myself is like, I'm putting the notes first. And then I'd say, RX, the RX prescription and billing to follow. But now because of communication, I learned that they need the RX first. So now, after every session, while I'm with the patient, I'm clicking off already.
01:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I say send it to them. That's whatever. Love you. This is gonna be I know it's trial. They're gonna there would be no reason for them to not do business with you I'm excited for you. I'm so proud of you.
01:11:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're going through so much I think I can go through so much and that's why I said I need to talk to you because I feel like I need to be Grounded I feel like I'm a grounded person anyways But I think I need to be grounded in this particular aspect of my life because this is like my act I'm holding on to this one because I know this is my win that I know I will win this year. So it's like I don't want to interrupt you. No go ahead.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would just add one more thing and you might have already done something like this But when when I am going for our things like I just have so much love for the people that are going through it with me and who are helping me so My type of gift giving is generally words because I feel like that's something that I have
01:12:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
By the way, good and I've learned that so that's what I give but for you like you like luxury things Like maybe you give something to Cheryl and Bellant. It did actually I figured I mean if you're close by I was like I know you're I mean I didn't know your address actually But mark maybe a mark that but I I know she loves because Cheryl and I again I think we connected now I mean week within the four months that we know each other is connected. I was able to I'm a very personable person anyways like I just I don't have problems like you know you're awesome with people but I learned she loves vintage brooch any like stuff and then in Japan I saw the Chanel brooch and it's 2005 so this vintage Chanel stuff is more it's better quality. Oh, yeah, and in Japan they don't sell fake So it's a crime, right? So I give it to her. She loves it. She's like, you don't have to. But I understand, and she understands, I understand the work that she's actually helping me. Now, it's not because Dr.
01:13:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E told her, but because I've been talking to her, I said, this kind of love you. You really are, I'm not telling you this because we were together. You're really just that level boy. You're, hate, I love emotions, but I hate them because physically, they're overwhelming in my body. Like, I feel it everywhere. But, Chona, you, you're not, you're not common, you're rare in everything. And you, you're the kind of person with the love and the light that you have, that people are going to want to have around them. And even when it's professionally, they're still, they're going to be like, I want to do good for her because you're doing good for them.
01:13:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, I'm going to keep happening, except for there are just some bad people that you don't want to, okay. Yeah, I know they are. And again, like I came from before I left for Japan, I gave them like, you know, just little things. And I obviously, because I love Hermes, and it helps my chance of getting a bag.
01:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if I will talk about that some other time that time.
01:14:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But I gave them like small perfume, like eat all of them, not because I see how they work. I see how I'm just very given. think Marc and I are interested because these are stuff for sharing, like we are blessed, like it's okay to like be generous.
01:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I didn't have point of having it. It's like karma and everything.
01:14:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then on that day that I got into an accident, actually, I have Christmas gifts with me. I don't know if you know this, I got into accident, right? You know this, right?
01:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if you know.
01:14:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Wait, before we went before we left for Japan. Did I not tell you before I left for Japan like a couple that week same week I fell in front of a I still have a slip and fall in front of a Starbucks two days later I have an accident it for my previous my daily driver I really love and it's still in the bar to shop and then Mark made a comment like isn't it coming threes and then you get the the theft and then I did the theft here so I said this has to be it like it's that's it it's I'm done and then just good things have to happen. But here's the thing you you didn't let it break you like Mark was worried about you because he said this is the stuff that you work for but I did no I was I don't want to cry because I think I'm the first one on the scene and I was so scared I was tired. I have a flashback of what happened when I was child. I didn't tell my mom because she's gonna be, she's not gonna help me.
01:16:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like she's just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be worried about her and her heart. I don't want to bring to her in the hospital.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is like three years of hard work and wins and losses. Like freaking Hermes game really caught me on the, it was like wrapped around her finger in terms of, I do love stuff. I do love luxury. I don't want this to deter me from loving what I like and living in theater. Lessons learned, know, being more, I guess we are very definitely nonchalant with stuff. We don't have bolts. don't have, my stuff is around. My mom told me, even my friends told me like, you guys have people in your house. Like we have the PA, we have the chef, like cleaners comic. We're very open. I guess it's just in life. That's how we are. We're very open to giving anything our own expertise Whatever we just give and I even question mark is this is my fault that I did this problem.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, am I being um, no, no tona It's a gift for you to know that that is not that stuff doesn't define you you can love it But it's not what's most important to you. Do you remember when you told me that you were worried, um You were kind of doubting yourself because like you were feeling bad about your financial goals And I think it was a rather time that you talked with your friends about, you know What you wanted to do and they're like, yeah, okay. Yeah, it was before it was before then and you were like You were you didn't want to be? Superficial or just about the money and then the next week you came and you told me about your hospital patients And you were just like so actually I think it was right out After that in the same conversation either way it was really recent and you were telling me how much you love them and how much love you and how much you want to take care of them. If nothing else this was just a gift for you to know that you can that part of the joy is not just that having them and having them be you know in in the closet most the time you're not seeing them all anyway you're not gonna wear them all all those things but it's that you can have them and and you get to enjoy them and you can go make more whoever took them from you they can't do that without stealing it from people you could just make it and then you make it and you give it so the gift is knowing that nobody can take anything really from you they can take the stuff you can get more stuff and if they had memories attached to them if they had meaning the memories stay with them the meaning stays with you the physical item leaves sometimes our families as a way, but their memories and the things that they give us, they don't pass away, right? They're taking from us.
01:19:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I was, I'm definitely, you know, I, I was meditating a little outside, but I noticed I'm very jumpy. I want to lock the doors, like I'm here, I got, I locked doors, I don't just come and tell me, but I noticed that I'm very jumpy and I'm on edge, but I'm looking at the positive, I'm trying, I'm not positive, yes, positive, but being objective about it, and not disregarding my process on it's a gloss, it's a grieve of losing stuff, and it's a fear of violating our privacy and our safety with the, I don't know if Mark should do that.
01:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did. The one thing I would say, and I'm, I'm a grounded person. to and but I also so I believe in being prepared but my guns are right there in a safe I've got like five of them and my girls have all got shooting I have security cameras we lock everything but what's meant to be is gonna be when it's my time God's in charge of that nobody else but I do believe in being prepared but statistically people can come back to places they've been to if it's not a lot of resistance so you may consider upgrading your security but still be peaceful I don't mean be afraid I just be prepared for the statistics maybe if you don't have security cameras just put them up security cameras are one of the best deterrents and they'll walk away that's right now again because of the neighborhood even our neighborhood they don't also have no one I think there's people that have
01:21:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
but there's no security individually, but because of this, now they're gonna, everyone is on edge around us and I call like, our neighbor across the street who have guns and they're across the street. I really like that. For some reason, I remember calling Mark because I'm the first one in there and then I call 911. I don't recall entirely the conversation 911, but I went outside because I feel safe inside and I call our neighbor and then they they like running right. I didn't even tell them what the problem is, but Keeson was like, Jonah never calls because Mark and him talk all the time, but I never called him.
01:21:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
knew you needed something.
01:21:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And so he's like, something went wrong. So him and his wife, they have a baby. They finally left their baby with their brother that's they're in the house, thankfully, so they have family with them. So they left the baby with them, toddler. And then they came to watch both of them and then mark came 20 minutes later, but they're with me in the house So I feel very grateful. That's why we love and it was we love that neighborhood That's why we don't want it to be and he's like I've been here for 25 years. I this is never happened like in the crime like There's a crazy son who killed his family and then the house was sold in at a lower price But that's he like that's That really is there's nothing like this that happened to us.
01:22:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So everyone is on edge too right now But this into is that sometimes that can bring communities together and Maybe you guys needed it for something else. There's there's so many things that we just don't even know But you did nothing wrong The there's no punishment you are doing amazing wonderful good thing as much as they There's real light and real good and God. There is an enemy and an adversary to that as well, and he's busy on his work. And, and so it doesn't mean anything. You just keep surrounding yourself with good people, keep loving them, keep supporting them. You're very good at giving as much, if not more than what you get, you're going to do amazing things. Keep thinking about this, like definitely go to Ted and say, look, this is what I need. Do you guys do this? Can you create this for me? If not, can I pay you to do it? If not, can you tell me who I can pay to do this for me? If not, we will find somebody to do it or we will sit on a call and do it together. But it's really going to make that big of a difference. These types of systems, they prevent errors.
01:23:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because I'm worried I'm going to have errors on date of birth because I'm just copy-pacing it or memorizing it and then putting it in.
01:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They prevent errors not just on your side and not even for just for the patient because now you're looking and making sure you're asking all these questions. It helps prevent errors on the attorney side like these types of systems are really important and they're worth all the work to get. So but you're the one bringing it to the table and that's you know part of your value so remember that.
01:24:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And yeah I'm very I'm on top of it like if a patient says oh my accident is 12 there's multiple occasions but there's there's a particular occasion situation I just want to tell you real quick. Patient said oh I had my accident was on the 8th of December but I didn't go to the Kaiser until the 12th and then on the attorney side the date of the accident is the 12th. So I told them I don't want to record something until I talk to you first. I said this is what the patient told me. and they verify it on their records like, yeah, oh, they're very thankful. Yeah, thank you for telling me this. That's why, that's why there's certain lingo that Mark told me that I have to write, being involved in a motor vehicle accident on or about. Yeah, it's not like on like, but like, you know, those things. Yeah, I'm very, very grateful or I think Mark right now is on a mode of, he was not being, he's tired that he's like on, I don't know what's the term, but he's on a work mode in a way. He's just, and surprisingly, we are calm Mark. We have dinner here at midnight. have, we cheers on a Sprite.
01:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
01:25:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then we have a, he bought some, you know, the popper. He was actually in the grocery when I called him that something happened, so he came right away, but he got poppers for a few years. And then we both agreed that we're going to get through this. We are very blessed and we're grateful for that. could have been a work second.
01:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:26:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Can't imagine, you know, happened to him. Because I'm the one that is leaving.
01:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's not.
01:26:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah. He just randomly decided he's going to leave too. So that's why we don't know how random is this.
01:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if he didn't leave? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you were watched over.
01:26:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, I believe that too.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You both do so much good. Like Mark, Mark has been very good for me, for my family, and been a blessing for me and to be able to get to see now I'm going to cry to get to work with you.
01:27:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm very excited and I'm very grateful when he told me that I was like, I'm very excited. And then you're a woman. know he has, I think that anyway, the point is like, it's a woman and I'm going to be able to connect better.
01:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I don't get to work with women because most women aren't making enough money to pay my prices. And if they are, they're really kind of underground, like we work underground, like, you know, and the ones that are not, they're not kind of thing and like, oh, like, attention that, like, I I don't like being , but not for the girls, you know, for my guy, for like my little inner circle kind of thing, you know.
01:28:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is my daily outfit, I'd rather, I know I love luxury stuff, they're freaking...
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'll also go climb a tree still. I was the tomboy, I love my nails, I love everything, so much, but I will put my own worm on my hook, it's still gross, but I will do it because I want to know that like I earned it all, and yeah, so I'm not, you know, for everybody. And anyway, in my industry, there's just not a lot, so getting to work with you is because your woman by itself is really special, but because it's you, Tona, you really, really, really are very unique. Your sweetness and your smartness and your tenacity, that is an incredibly unique, rare package. I know I'm one of those types of people and I get that feedback. I know from people how rare I am and that's how you are. so the fact that I got to work with you, like I'm just over the moon with it. So if you need anything, I'm here for you.
01:29:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Thank you. Well, you already are. I that's why I said this meeting had to happen because life and this is like my anchor and I'm just hanging in on this one because and then they texted me to today, the staff. They're very nice to share your and Dr. Ease. Like, do you want us to take away or tell the medicine tomorrow? I was like, no, I thought about it. It's like, no, I just have to keep on going.
01:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, these are my, you don't want to lose momentum.
01:29:48 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's what will kill you.
01:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes.
01:29:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yes. That's what I'm worried about yesterday because I know who my old me was. My old me was. There's a term I tell Marcus, you know, like when I, I'm in the mud, when I'm very depressed, I, and I'm in the mud, I get, and then after some time, I like being there. And it will be very difficult for me to get out of it, because it becomes comfortable. And I don't want to, to, I've experienced it, recently when my dad passed away. And I know how it felt. I don't, I refuse to be in that place again.
01:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of what I lift weights. I am COVID, like I thought all I wanted to do was have all the free time I wanted and all the money to do whatever I wanted to do. And then COVID came and that's what I had lots of money and lots of free time. And my spirit just died. And also, I, my body shape change, I atrophy, and I did not know how much muscle I lost. so for the last year, I've been being really, really heavy weights. only go like two to four times a month. I don't go often because I actually get weaker if I go too much. My shape has changed, especially the back side.
01:31:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
really like that. I can't tell the boys these things. can tell. I can't wait. I don't, in general, I do, I did write on my, my journal today. And, you know, I just try to meditate a little bit and just things that I want to do for myself. And I know going back to the house, it definitely is painful, but like, it's a process. I'm not going to bypass the grief feeling, the grief process. I'm not going to buy five seconds. Also, it's not normal. don't know. thing. But I am focusing on what I can control what I can focus on, which is this is one big one.
01:32:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So we should also, next week or sometime soon, I would love to know like how do you take care of yourself? Like what are you doing? Do you have?
01:32:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)

01:32:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A nutritionist and a trainer.
01:32:28 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm telling you.
01:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those things change my life. How I ate and how I moved. And but so many people are going home and they go obsessive and they do.
01:32:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm so proud of Mark. Like you met him two years ago. I am so proud of how he thank care of himself and oh gosh, it's like almost 12 years now. When I first met him, he doesn't like to take care of himself. Like I feel like I have to nag him to go to his doctor and stuff. but now he's and it's so it's so good. So yeah, I need to basically practice why I preach. I need talk. Yeah, I mean, I want to do those NAD stuff too.
01:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it's like, oh, yeah.
01:33:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)

01:33:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Do I could tell you? okay. I know. Like, because I have, I told you about that, the autoimmune and I need to, I even write it in my notes. It's like, I need a physical exam and blood to work.
01:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have not done that. Yes. Okay, so make a goal like write down your goals and tell me I can be accountable with you and help you but also so I can help you because you can't if you try to do all the things at once it's going to help you so you want to prioritize like what is the thing that's going to give you the most benefit first and then start stacking all the other things that kind of like make that foundation solid but you want to start with the thing that gives you the most the feeling that you can feel the change the most first I think I need to be consistent with my schedule then I pick I get a hold of that then I can do okay so actually but here's the thing I'm gonna tell you it's harder to be consistent with your schedule when you're not consistent with your diet because your diet will screw up your schedule and so if you start with your diet and energy first your schedule will become easier that's what i'm talking about like send me all your Because I'll tell you, if you do them out of order, or if you do them in the right order, each one will become easier to attain when you choose the right one first.
01:35:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. I do fast before, I do daily fast, like I do intermittent, like I do intermittent fasting, but I did a long fast before but it's more of spiritual to that when I was, you know, leaving and after that fast I feel much better. Obviously, I did lost weight and my blood word is amazing. The doctors, like what did you do? I said fast. This is like obviously lost weight. before I try this patient, the joints is better with your lighter.
01:35:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

alcohol, once in a while, I would, but that definitely flared me up. Yeah. In the nightshades, nightshades. Oh yeah, which is very good in gluten, which is very good, but I, I don't know, that's gonna be very hard to to change.
01:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, we, uh, it's already been like way over, um, but we got lots of week when you're talking to, we'll just keep talking through all of it and you don't have to wait through the week. We're gonna talk about all those.

01:36:46 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have to make some other calendar changes also.
01:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:36:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, actually, I would love to see before I leave on 9. If that's not happening, I think we should continue.
01:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, at the very least, we can do voice messages because there's no good, I think.
01:37:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, it definitely definitely helps. Okay, so I need to change the setting. Will you help me? So I don't lose, because I was worried that I'm going to lose the, what do you call that? I was worried that I'm going to lose your voice message.
01:37:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or I, that you won't leave my voice message. don't know because I did it like ages ago, but I think is it per message thing? Yeah. So it's just an all time setting. It's so weird. They've changed everything so much in this latest update. And I don't even know how to navigate everything yet. Hold on.
01:38:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
If I did this on my, my friends and it's like gone, they didn't hear my message because it's up to their setting, I guess.
01:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, it is for the device. So like, if you don't want to lose your messages, you can't control it, but you can't control other people's messages. Okay, so in settings, you have to go to apps. What OS do you have now?
01:38:29 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Do you have the latest? I have the latest, I think. What is the latest? About 18.1.1.
01:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do it. Hold on. Okay. Oh, it is. Okay. So you go to settings, you go to apps, then you go to messages.
01:38:49 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oops.
01:38:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is all the way down at the bottom.
01:38:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Uh, Let me tell them I don't see apps. So settings and. then go to apps, okay, and then miss again.
01:39:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
way down the messages, yeah. Okay, and then all the way down at the bottom, they'll say audio messages.
01:39:22 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Um, audio messages, uh-huh.
01:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then expire and mine is set to never.
01:39:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay, okay, I just changed it.
01:39:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. You're welcome.
01:39:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And I was so worried. I'm like, oh my god, it's gone.
01:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
much space do you have on your phone?
01:39:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because I have like a terabyte. Oh, I don't know if I have that much. Mark got me, um, is it about?
01:39:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, iPhone storage or? Yeah.
01:39:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have have 256 gigabytes.
01:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you have like 25% of what I So, how much, how much have you used?
01:40:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Well, it says I have available any more.
01:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, well, I don't think it can be changed, right? Well, you can get rid of things, but I don't know if you can see.
01:40:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, I can see which ones. Yeah, the applications is 240. I don't know if this is correct. The photos is a lot. The photos is 39,500.
01:40:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to go clear a bunch of things because I'm using a 860 gigabytes on my phone.
01:40:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But any of them, you have so much.
01:40:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you add phone?
01:40:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah. can we get that?
01:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have one terabyte ones now. And I use it and I keep lots of stuff.
01:41:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
um anyway yeah thank you now yeah but what I want to tell you is now that you've done that your messages can like my messages take up only almost two gigs and also gonna be videos and audio so what I've been doing is I thought I'm gonna lose your message too so what I've been doing actually is I've been sending your message to myself too so now I don't have to do them let's watch message I love that I love that okay all right you feel better yeah I know Mark is like texting me I know that you know he's worried about me and I'll be okay thank you know it's a process and I just don't want to love to have and to lose the love of this stuff Because I do love it. We love it.
01:42:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We love the game. Yes. Yes. Don't know Things are gonna happen and they'll happen to everything.
01:42:10 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So don't let yourself change it because it was Stuff right versus a person versus whatever, you know, and and also remember that that you love it But you don't love it more than As I was looking at mark like if something happened to him and they took a stop, but I wouldn't Probably, you know forgive myself. I will think that it's because of me loving those stuff. That's why something happened to him Like I yeah, so I'm just to have I'm just definitely glad that we're together. I can't imagine We have a great time too in Japan So we always like do uh the business classes it's it's fine we don't need the first classes it's the first no not the first because some first class looks like business class too so it's right but the first time that we have the Singapore Air Force class and it's really good and we feel rejuvenated with some little whole sweeping pause and things like that we feel like oh gosh like I need to work harder so that way if for example also mark is not here I can do this for my own family like I want them to like experience this yeah like that's exactly already what I was like I need to work hard because you want to give it to other people but the energy of having your own is what gives you the energy to go create it for other people so that's really important to understand and that's okay God said that we can have all the things that we want to as long as we want to bless other people with it you know what I just realized that This is actually the year that I have given so much to others, like in kind, whether you're only going to keep giving more money and everything. This is also the time that we got lost, you know, the most in terms of stuff.
01:44:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. when I told you about yin and yang?
01:44:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah.
01:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they always, always will balance each other out. And this is why a lot of people play really small, because they don't want those big feelings. They're afraid of the big good and they're afraid of the big bad. So you just have to know that if you get that great good, you will have the great bad. It does balance it out, but it won't feel like it's more except for in the tiny moments when it happens. So you just have to let it pass through and understand that that is universal, that is that is spiritual, that is divine, that is bigger than us, has nothing to do. with you earning anything bad, good and bad, and dark, equal opposites and all things for eternity. But you do so much great good. me, I always feel like it's worth the bad. But also, the bad is not just bad. It teaches me something.
01:45:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It leaves a gift behind.
01:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it thinks that it can break me.
01:45:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But what it does is makes me stronger. Yeah, I definitely feel there's moments, but I mean, I don't need to talk to you like right now. Like, or Dr. E is like, you don't need to see patients tomorrow. Like, no, I and what I meant is I know you wouldn't understand. Like, people don't understand. But it's like, no, I can't. I have to keep moving.
01:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's why I know that you're going to be okay, no matter what happens.

I don't think I would have even tried it with kids at home until it just happened to be that one of my friends did it. And I was like, okay, we can do this. Like I didn't know. And then there's the whole friend. issue, right? So like, making it feel like there's a weird dynamic or whatever, but we, so she did it for like 10 years for me. And then she moved and that was last year. And I'm like, everything's fine, everything's fine. I'm like, everything is not fine.
00:03:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm gonna have to replace everyone. Like, nobody's gonna take care of me like her.
00:03:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She like actually loved me. Anyway, um, man, it's such a busy week, a short week, but it is a week. And I want to make sure I'm not late to you. So my daughter got her GED. This is her junior year, but she's like, with these people, basically. I'm like, well, you know, I rather than watch you destroy yourself emotionally, why don't you just get done? And so anyway, Yeah That's right because what she wants to do anyway tattoos air nails and she's already got those skills down and She's she's my very free spirit my rocker my you know, and I'm like she does she does Make a partner One of them one of them. Yeah. She's did I ever show you avatars makeup Thanks. yeah Yeah, she's the one that did that so You know, I'm like this is not They're not even doing anything. That's really useful for you You need to know math and you need to know it well I mean you need to know something and you also need to learn how to put up with people, but oh I'm gonna teach you another name. Oh, well not in this one not in this one anyway Yeah, so anyway, but she wasn't gonna go through any of the you know the event type stuff Because the GED program is different. It wasn't all people she went to school with. It's not her class because she did it a year early blah blah blah. And then she's like, well, I'm doing it. And there's a walk and would she tell me Tuesday, I think. I'm like, all right then, we are rescheduling everything because whatever experience you want to have, we're going to have. Anyway, okay, so last week we went over the orgs part and man, that was a massive reduction of refinement. And my question is, did it cause any percolation? just sometimes that happens. do something you percolate. Nope. And you're like, I already knew this. I already knew this. We just actually put it on the page.
00:05:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm not related to that. The only thing I was like, like, I don't know what's going on with Eric. Like, I mean, I already told Norio, hey, dude. this isn't working by the end of the era. I'm out, which still holds true. And then I still want to do that reduction thing with him. But like ever since ever since that issue with Eric and Dibba, like when they blew up on that dude back in December or whenever, it's like things have never been the same since. And there's just this weird, it's and it's not coming from me at all. There's this weird thing with them. And I think I predicted this. I've like, I predicted I'll be next, right?
00:06:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because when they're target, like do we target them?
00:06:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And it won't, it won't, they won't target me. But they are, right? so they're probably talking all kinds of about me when they're together, because it's this, this, like, Like, I dubbed them the toxic twins the other day. I was like, they're like the toxic twins. They're bad for each other at the end of the, or really give us, I think bad for Eric is probably the better way to say it. But it's like, I can feel it. And it's like, it doesn't bother me really. But I'm like, okay, why do I have to put up with this ? I don't, flash, I don't, I told Stacy on Monday, like, give has been working on sweet love stuff and some other stuff. So the sweet love stuff, like we got all caught up on and he was just like super overwhelmed by it, which I understood, because I went and looked at it and I was like, God damn, this is a lot. And, and Gert's system isn't great, not a fan. I'm like, I comment on stuff and I'm like, okay, would you comment back? How do I know? Because as far as I could tell, it's not notifying me. And then I have to go find the that I commented on and I'm like, this is no. so we whittled it down to where like, Giba has five tasks. Eric has won. gave one to Eric. And it was was like technical. But then I told Stacy, it's hilarious. told Stacy yesterday, hey, if he doesn't have a story done by the end of the week, he's done. We got to find somebody else because I'm not I'm not putting up with this anymore. And then I was talking to Eric yesterday, who was like, I'm annoying about like, oh, he's doing such a bad job managing Munir, and he was just getting all on his head. I'm like, bro, the dude, now we don't know if this is true or not, but I'm going to go with the guys telling me the truth. His kid is sick. He's got some family issues. happened. So yeah, and how Oh, and then it happened to Eric and Norio several times over the year? Right. I'm like, and I'm like, don't care, like straight up, I am, I am not empathetic to that at all, to be totally honest. Like I'm not sitting around going, Oh God, that poor guy. I don't know him. I don't know. I mean, like, here's what I know. There's that we need to get done. So I go rather than turn it into this big thing. I reached out to Munir and I was like, I fall on game and out. I was like, Hey, look, if you can't do this right now, I totally understand. You just got to let me know. Right. And if that's the case, if there was a developer you could recommend, I would appreciate it. If you cannot do that, totally fine. Let me know. And he wrote back, I do not want to stop working on this. I apologize. Yeah, I'm still going through this deal with the stuff. I just can't he's like he just is like I can't get on a meeting with Eric and those guys Can you just send me a task and I'll just do the tasks and I go bye. Yeah, totally It's just whatever's going on with his family right so he does I think he just he's like I just can't block out an hour to get on the phone with those guys Which I 1,000 percent understand I was like, I'm right I have to get on the phone. I don't So he's like could you can you just tell me what needs to be done? And can we just work with the three-mail for now because he's like I know I can't I can't and I go Yeah, totally we can do that so then I turn around I go to Eric and I go hey Talking to me near and then he just launches into this whole thing about like I can't handle this and got to time like okay You're not handling any I know I'm like So he's getting all in his head although this did bring up the org chart Funnily enough Gina. I'm in my head. I'm seeing the org chart.

I'm like, are you managing it or you know, you're not really managing it because you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting, like, manage it. You don't wait. You go. Okay, I got to get this thing done. like, okay, he doesn't really understand like. Okay, we can work with this guy. I'm like, or we have to figure out if we can. He says he wants to. This is what he wants to do. So I explained to him. I go, okay, here's, here's what I need to know from you. XYZ. He literally is just not answering what I'm asking. And he's going on and on and on about how I'm this guy's ghosting us. I'm like, focus.

Totally. He's not. I'm like, Hey, this is what we need to do. Can you tell me, like, give me, because full on, like, I don't understand the breath of what's going on. So I'm like, okay, you need to tell me. I need to understand what's going on exactly. So I'm going to, you know, ask a bunch of questions to figure it out. like, all right. So is this where we're at? Is it, is it X, Y, C, look like this? And he's like, yes. It looks like that. I go, okay, great. So we're dealing with like bugs and then sort of tweaks and then full on new features. Yeah. Okay. Great. What do we need to launch WolfArt? Do we need features? Do we need bug fixes? Do we bug fixes and tweaks? we need it's bug fixes and tweaks. I go great. No features. No features. Great. I need you to give me a priority list of whatever it is from those first two categories that will allow us to launch that site in any subsequent sites, knowing that the rest is going to get done, you know, additionally, right? And whether we catch the features part or not, it's irrelevant. Because I'm like, if we don't need the feature, we're not going to do it. Can you do that? Yeah, but oh my god. No, no button. No button. I'm like, so then I'm expecting like, I talked to him and this is, well, why didn't he say that to me? I'm like, you didn't ask. And it's because Eric's like super nice in his emails. And I'm like, you're not. So yeah, in a way, you're not managing this. And I wasn't totally expecting you to, but I sort of am, but I'm so right, whatever. So you get through all that. Yeah, I mean, ultimately I'm in charge, right? that's why I hit up here was like, all right, if you need to go, then you need to go. And then I need to figure out the alternative path, which was my chat GPT, whatever. And then it's also getting me like, all right, these guys going to learn how to build blocks, which there's tons of resources out there. just going to find the resources. found one yesterday, sent it. was like, I won't go watch this. So yeah, that I was dealing with all that. And I'm like, OK, I think we got they should have a list to me today. And then I hit up Moonie again after your response. I said, OK, here's what we're going to do. I'm going to say your priority task and allow us to launch sites, blah, blah, He asked there was an issue with bugs getting reintroduced. I don't know if you're aware of this, which he wasn't because Eric just knows that it happens and then ruminate on it. And I'm like, it doesn't help.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't have this stuff.
00:14:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I think you found the old habits. So anyway, there's that and then there and then you add that into I'm like dude I don't really need your weirdness and then this I Don't need both of these things right now, right? Sorry And apart, you know part of me sitting there going I mean do I just I've thought it many many times I'm like I just go to me like hey, man. Here's 50 grand.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You got six months upon a job like It's the best I can do I Mean that's kind of and nobody does that so And it's why you keep in mind. mean think about what it was like when you got rid of Evan when the Francesco is gone When Glenn was gone, right?
00:15:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's it's nowhere near that level Don't don't get it wrong like it doesn't it's no weird near any of those. It's just I'm just looking down the road going where where am I just like like, I've resolved to this too. I decided so Friday, it was supposed to be. Hey, we're going to go in and we're going to do the vocals on this song or whatever. And then nobody, I mean, Stacy was there, but I was like, I'm not going to record just Stacy. But it was supposed to be Giba, Eric, at least one of them, Jenny, and then Stacy. So Eric, Jenny and why would you lie to me and then text the person right next to me? how dumb are you? Giba lies and says, oh, I can't make it in today. And then Jenny's sitting behind me and she goes, Mike is, Mike said he's almost at our house. Can he get in?
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, so you drove past here. Wow.
00:16:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Their house is south of where we are. You lie and say you can't make it in, but you're going to their house and you guys are all meeting up after which is fine.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get it. Your friends. That's all good. Right.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you lying and then yeah, I know and it's like it's like just whatever like don't you don't want to come in. Don't come in like whatever. And so I thought that was funny and then so then they're like they got to go meet Mike at their house and I go all right. So I guess we're not doing the vocals today. And they're you know, they brought they had like their puppy or whatever, which is very cute. So in that moment, was like, oh, yes, super cute. So So in that moment, I'm like, you know what? I'm not I'm not gonna work on those songs at all Unless they unless they say they want to do it and then I'm gonna be like, did you practice? And if you didn't practice, then I'm not we're not doing it because I'm not I'm not wasting my time sitting around listening to you Croak into a mic like it's not happen. And they'll never, they'll never, you know, I'm gonna predict the future here. They're never gonna ask it, but they're gonna talk about the fact that I'm not doing it endlessly. And that will be that's like the seed of what it is, which I think is super ironic, because it's like, you're, you're, you're not gonna do the thing, but you're going to criticize me for not doing the thing. But it's, it's your thing. I'm not doing anything. I'm, I'm just gonna record it. Like you're, you're supposed to say, it's the, what's holding it up is you. Yes, we started this in November. FYI. So I'm gonna go work on my Dan Burke song. And then that's gonna really bother them, because then I'm gonna release that and they're gonna be like, hey, whatever.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What drama sounds like being dead aren't allowed.
00:19:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's it's it's it's pending that's whole thing It's not really yet, but I think it's going to be real We'll see Well I'm telegraphing right exactly. It's my intuition thing.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what coming down the pipeline Yeah, but it's it's yeah, I don't I think that it's partially there You're just like it hasn't hit a threshold. So I don't think you're projecting and predicting I think you're interpreting and it's you're Probably on point and it just hasn't hit a threshold.
00:19:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's just a threshold Yeah, I think the problem With it is It's not real. It's not true. So they they they can't i mean it could be to a degree i mean maybe i'm wrong here but i can imagine eric talking about me to jenny and jenny being okay with that or or give the same about me to tracy and trade like tracy came down for my birthday specifically to hang out and because i don't i want to right so i'm like all right this is if this is the path we're headed down then let's see what happens you never know so um they could have some personal awakenings we'll see yeah um especially if you you have any luck anyway i've got multiple thoughts about it but all of it is speculation and speculation is just speculation so it's kind of a right Wait, we're in a wait and see.
00:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my speculation is a way. You're sharing what's happening is Is the just the beginning is an observation observation to me and speculation are very different things? So anyway Okay, so well, let's see That's good Well, let me open my nose for a quick. It was not and I guess for the first thing that I was trying to Make sure I was ready to walk out the door for my girl Newsflash Okay, almost set a record yesterday Not a lot like just a score release like we set this record in December, but it was because the BEC exam was ending Right, right.
00:21:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, there's gonna be this huge flood, but the first real score release of 2024 was, well, it actually wasn't supposed to be until next week. then out of nowhere, they announced it that it's Monday, his past Monday. So then Monday, we did like 80. And then yesterday, we did like 94. And I think our record was 98 back in December, because of the EC, and I was like, damn, new order. That's new subscriptions. So not, yeah, new subscription, not new customers.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What were the numbers again?
00:22:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, today was 94. I think Monday was 82 or 86, we're going to, unless we change the current. we're averaging 30 a day, we should cap out. Well, now actually, it's stuff like this that will alter it, we're going to cap out in 120 days. So I did this whole thing, the glass ceiling, calculation that I've always, I figured it out at one point and I forgot about it because we were going through all this weirdness. But I realized when Bobby was like, oh, release. Wait, wait, we're now returning to normal. This is the first normal since COVID, right? We had all this crap with COVID and the exam changed. went out of this normal, went away for almost 40 years. It's like, holy , we're returning to normal. Granted, it's not totally normal because the score early schedule for the rest of the year is slightly altered. But for all the purpose, it's pretty frickin normal. the score release windows are a little broader. Don't ask me why they don't. at this, but they are. I'm like, how that actually probably works in our favor, because the time between score releases mean they might hang on, whatever. So I'm like, that could play in our favor. But that's not a metric we really look at. When we look at it, but it's LTV, it's like, huh, LTV, because that's great. But really, it's like, okay, we're still going to hit this 30 a day, or we are hitting this 30 day. So I did the class ceiling calculation, which says you'll get 3600 total subscribers based on the current new per day in the churn. So in 120 days, we'll hit that or sooner. So I told those guys yesterday, I was like, hey, this is happening. And then I went and figured out, I'm not done yet because I'm going to get one more number. figured out our CAC, which I've never done before. And that is $16.
00:24:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we make back the cost to acquire a customer.
00:25:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So most SaaS, yeah, but it costs to require customer and SaaS, they use CAC, don't I say why? Okay. So usually your CAC is whatever and then the calculation of the CAC is this other formula which I can show you but I don't remember, I can't explain to you about the phone. But ours is $16 and I'm like, well, okay, we make our money back in two weeks. So, which is ridiculous, because usually with SaaS, your CAC is much greater. takes months to get it back. So your CAC and LTV sort of interact with each other a little more than here. Then I was like, okay, so if we have 7,000 new customers, the CAC is being calculated by me taking all the ad spend ever for 2023 and then dividing the total new customers into that. So now I'm like, okay, I need to. figure out how many of those 7,000 customers can be directly attributed to ads, but I'm saying they're all result of that, but I know they're not. But if I could go figure out, if I could go figure out, if I could source them and say, well, actually, know, 2000 of those did appear to come from Google or they're coming from Facebook or whatever, then it would be, all right, can I, can I go now, which is something I've also never done? Can I now actually go spend money and increase customers and know that that's what's happening? Because I've never, I don't believe that's what's happening. But other than with the CPA exam, I'm like, I know that that works. So can I go to a source and a starting site and then go, okay, well, our CAC could be $67 like but if even if it's 16 like can I go buy a new customers at 16 can I move that 30 to 35 or 40? Ultimately 40 would be the number I shoot for. I don't know. I don't know to do that yet though. I'm to drive around.
00:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think also that you know the end of Q2 and end of Q4 would be a good time to take a post on market share. I mean once a year is probably okay but I think twice a year just kind of taking a post on it and see how we're going.
00:27:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the Q3 is the yeah end of Q3 is our best time to do it because summer season which I learned last year is so we're heading into peak season which was the other reason I did this. It's like, all right, we're returning to normal right at the beginning of our high season. So I'm like, I need to figure out what's going on so I can spend money and do whatever. Like, we got to go at it for the next three months because, and then it dips off and August sales will dip slightly in September, always get a bunch of cancels in December and people that we rebound in January and then we go into the season, very March, April, summer, May. So it's like, okay, we've got to figure this out right. Just like I also said, hey, we need to launch the new product now, ASAP. What are we doing? Like that, that kind of bugged me a little like, he's like, oh, I'm going to have the notes done in January. I'm like, no, you're not. When I June, they're still not done. I'm like, why didn't we use AI for the, the, um, the notes, the audio? like, why didn't we use AI for the audio again? And we could have like, Opted like my whole thing was like let's do it and then we can switch it out later, but let's get the products done But no Chad GBT 40 So to all these calculations work like a charm I was like, oh my god, this is great.
00:29:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I It's I'm just like so the day I was talking to Maria Chad GBT for okay now and that same day Some old clients who there are husband and wife marketing agency But when we were working together, worked together for two and a half years and then COVID hit it But what they mostly promoted was yoga studios. So COVID says about it and they're like we can't afford you anymore Well, they reached out and they're like we once or help, we can't afford you yet I'm like well, you know what? How about you work on this, you know little thing for me cuz I just need somebody else's brain energy to plug into momentarily because I've got all of this for the most part figured out I know what to do. I just want somebody just to be like take this part. Anyway, so the same day I talked to Maria Those two things happen. I was like, Hey, Hey, chat to you before oh, so Jeff. No, I get that they are something who's recording Oh, Yeah, okay, so but there's the ever written part done He's yeah, but he is freewheeling the audio That's that's his argument.
00:30:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
like well. not doing a literal. I go well. What if it were? What what if it were just your voice? He's like he's doing an audible and changing things like on the fly and he thinks it makes it better and maybe it does But it doesn't matter now. He's literally almost done, but I'm like, okay I like why didn't we because it when I I put those pieces together, I texted Bob, like we just met with the Infusionsaw people and they sent it around all their tasks and the bottom of the list was getting new products ready. go, no, we need to flip that. We need to get that done now. We're crazy if we're not launching this right now because we're going to get maximum amount of data. It's our high season. So we're going to get the most sales, the most people, like this is the prime feedback loop. We need to get this ready now. And so we're doing that. I'm like, I almost don't care if the product's ready. I really don't care if doesn't affect this. The lower end product doesn't, like, well, actually does have audio. So, we'll see.
00:31:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, Sarah, hold on next week. Do you have what the new product new offer is going to be, like, the price and what? What did all entail them like bullet points? Could you put that out to me really quick?
00:32:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're launching a supplement product that's notes, audio, MCQ for 67 bucks a month. we're raising the price on the course, the number of supplement and course.
00:32:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're going too fast.
00:32:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, it's.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Of course, 97.
00:32:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The course will be.
00:32:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was. It was 67. Yeah. Okay. So now it, the course is went from 67 to 97, but in addition to the course, you can have the audio notes for 67 a month. So the course, but the course is a subscription of 97 and they can access the different parts according to whatever they want to write.
00:32:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, they're both subscriptions.
00:32:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Suppling. Okay. No, so the supplement subscription. Get your access to those three products and then the course subscription gets you access to everything. Oh So if so you wouldn't get ninety seven and sixty seven it's ninety seven or sixty seven Correct because still Happened last week happened every week Do I buy the supplement or do I buy the course like what are you talking about like there's one product?
00:33:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's this confusion persist and I'm it at the worst case scenario is Everyone buys just the supplement for sixty seven bucks and we that's why part of me is like we should make it 77 77 in 97 You should split test that because we know that Choices create friction period even if it's just two options Somebody might look at that go and I don't know which one And then in that hesitation they get a new notification Complete the order and they look at it and they're like, I still haven't decided. I'll come back later Do they even do it or the an advertiser problem?
00:34:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
competitor come in The problem now I believe based on I mean this was on reddit. It's like oh my god The problem now is they go to the checkout page and they think there's another product. There isn't I'm like, what are you talking about? There is no supplement But because our brand is associated with being a supplement They think there is one and it's like they don't know where it is. I'm like, there isn't one What how much more do we need to explain this? So I'm like, okay, so if we put it there then there is one So my argument is that we're gonna get more customers by resolving the confusion The only way to resolve the confusion is to give them the binary choice and go here it is and it's laid out so clear. Here you go. Um, and that was the reason to like, it has to be at least 67 bucks. It can't be lower. Jeff is like, let's make a point. said, I'm like, no, we cannot lower the price. We can only raise it. I'm like, we should make it 77 and 97 to close the gap between those two. And if people, if everyone just starts buying supplement based strictly on price, we lose at 67. We've done, we've gained nothing. But if we make that 77, then we're gonna, we will increase our, our revenue, that percentage, whatever that increases, 10% or whatever makes sense to me.
00:35:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the price jump from 67 77, I doubt you'll lose hardly anything.
00:35:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, you will not. And then the getting, having the gap between the two only be $20. $30 is 50%. 20 is not. 20 is like, Oh, for $20 more, I can get all of that. that there's not to. And then ultimately we're just tracking new customers because the new customer number doesn't matter. I don't care what they buy. Does that number stay the same or go up? Period. Doesn't matter which one they buy. It's a new customer. Done.
00:36:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you have on-page chat support, right?
00:36:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now that was a cool done.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even that, they would ask that question back then.
00:36:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And what we didn't have is all my questions.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But with an AI chat box, as good as GPT-40 is, I wonder if that test would be worth doing again.
00:36:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Especially with that question program. Well, with the one that we dealt for Mark, mean that thing works great. So I could look at that.
00:36:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Especially because you're trying to increase market shares. just the technology, not okay, but there are two major things that have changed. The technology has changed, but the people have changed a lot. Because, like since COVID, post COVID, and with AI, all the end users are more open to it. Even grandparents are aware of AI and chat talk now. Like, the whole community has changed so drastically that it would be a completely new test, no matter what.
00:37:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, we did it before. I mean, this is what I know from before. It literally did zero, zero, no improvement, right? it was costing us $2,400 a month. So I was like, why are we doing this? Why are we paying these people $2,400 a month? it cost nothing to run anything out of chat. So it's like, okay, if it doesn't, and we have much more stable numbers, Now where it's like, oh, yeah, we would know exactly and if we launched that prior to the new products Well, don't know. There's some weirdness happening none of us saw yesterday happening Bobby was like what the hell I'm like what he does look at the numbers. Holy What's going on? I did turn on some Facebook ads, but I don't think that's it. I Mean it was me.
00:38:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks everyone Oh Yeah, okay, so I have a lot of other questions as usual, but I can't ask because I have to go Well, I wanna I don't want to be wait. I'm like Okay, another call I need to go to the office Well, I'm gonna bug you more about another 71 on and off while we talk about all the other things just cuz You're in development mode and and it's fun and it's cool and I want to see you and I sent all that stuff to the I sent all the stuff to those brokers too that's some quite I gotta send this more stuff but I finally did that and they wrote back and they're hey can you send us this and what about oh I finally don't ask that question and then on a second okay so what do they call like founders uh oh yeah uh I always forget the second word now founders partners but it's found or something yeah oh you always can't say founder guys or something like that yeah or that's what I have it's founders for sure founders partners no all right um cool well then you enjoy your drive and your next call and have a great weekend and I will bug you on Monday.

Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello. Kind of quiet.
00:00:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Almost be my hair pods.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're nice and loud now. Okay. Well, I am struggling with energy. I'm super allergic to where I live. And yesterday I had an asthma attack. I wasn't sure I was going to survive. And I'm just kind of sleeping. Yeah, it was pretty scary. But also I've been through stuff like that. But anyway, my brain is just not, well, I don't know, my energy, I think my brain is fine. I just, and I feel tired. So hopefully it'll pick up. I've done all the things. It either will or I won't. But yeah, just letting you know how to time if you're like, what's up?
00:01:21 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm sorry. No worries.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm used to it. Just got to let people know because my energy swings so much because of health. That sometimes people are like, what, like, is it me? Did I do something? So I just got to let them know at a time that I'm like, no, I'm fine. Everything's fine. It just feels different. Not me.
00:01:51 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. Yep. Okay.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited for this. excited to see what you've been doing. I think if we can screen share. I've been praying for it every day for you and also for them so that we know that we can be inspired for them to help us them accomplish their mission and know how to package and put things together. So yeah, anyway, I'll be quiet. Thank you.
00:02:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Same. So we're thriving on the same level there. So can you see the workflow? I'm sharing. Okay, let me point out a couple of things here. They just did this event last week. Okay, they reinvent your self-summit and over five days they traditional summit style where replace available for a while. If you join our $39 month thing, you get all the replays, plus all 80 of my meditations or hypnosis audios.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that for?
00:03:16 - Seth Ellsworth
They sell those on their shop. How much of these on the summit for? It was free.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:03:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I think they had a VIP level. And they only got like 30 people in there. Oh, I have no idea how many people they got in there.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I thought you said okay.
00:03:40 - Seth Ellsworth
I was like, wow, they had a VIP level. And this is because this this thing right here, I'm going to highlight it in yellow. This is their seems to be their new focus is building this community. This is this is on Um, mighty networks, okay, $39 per month. And I imagine, you know, that's, this could be a play that, and John mentioned this on our first call, it's called grow and transform. Um, getting more people into this would be freaking child's play with a proper email. Um, So this could be the guts of what we suggest for them as a focus. Um, So, so that's, that's, that's a potential direction. Now, just to give you a picture of, of their business model, they kind of have two paths or two buckets. And these are absolutely not clear on their website either. Uh, because there's a lot of confusing crime. crossover. But they have the RTT therapy and personal development. And here they give away some regifts. Here's the landing pages to get a therapy partner. So so Marissa does not do therapy calls. She has a team of therapists that are trained. And people book calls just like they would from any therapists. So there's that. This, if I had to guess, is a small percentage of their revenue. Because they're therapists, we don't know because they haven't asked those questions per se, the career, the career path where they become a therapist and are allowed to offer RTT to their, to their clients. That's the 15. This is the $15,000 high ticket thing. think this is probably 95% of their revenue.
00:06:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It based off of experience with other people and smaller models where they do a thing or they teach people or certify them how to do the thing.
00:06:20 - Seth Ellsworth
That's always the case. It's the teaching and certifying, yeah. Right, so this certification, and they do have a certification course, I'm sorry, they have a course and a certification, but it seems to me like they drive most of the traffic to the book a call stuff. So let's see, book a up here. So there's that. We have, they have events. They do these all over the place. They have events for both tracks. One, the track for people that want to experience their own breakthrough and the track for people that want to be practitioners and then they have events as part of their fulfillment. So there's marketing events and then there's fulfillment, fulfillment events. This is, this, their conversion is probably really, really high with this. don't do a lot of marketing events. And I'm sure that that expands a lot of resources and time and they're getting older. So I'm. An educated guess would be they don't want to do more events.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:07:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So an evergreen thing that runs that sells this $39 a month deal to where they don't have to do this is the first time they ever did the reinvent yourself summit that's a brand new thing. I have no idea how it produced. And a lot, I watched probably 10 of those sessions released the replay and most of them were recorded previously, which is a big undertaking, but now they have an asset that they can use. just, my opinion would be, this is incongruent with RTT because it's a bunch of random value that is not going deeper with their unique ability. So Marissa showed up and she did, she was, I think on three of the days, she was the first segment where she led them through a meditation or a sorry, I keep calling a meditation hypnosis, which great, but to me, they're running somebody else's playbook here. which is incongruent with this offer. So what we would do for them, essentially, this would be what I would look at, is I would go to their, let me share a second. I'm sure my browser. Here's a re-event yourself summit. Lander. They had some ballers in here. Jim Wick. John Asiraf, James Altucher, Pace Morvey's huge. He's a $600 million guy. But he's real estate. And then, anyway, this is a very, very random sampling, which I think is good five years ago. I don't think summits convert very well. And I could be wrong, but if I had to guess, I would say this didn't exceed their expectations. Here are landing pages. This is a landing page for free gift that is for somebody who doesn't know what path they want to go on. Here are an example of four gifts that they give away for free. So you click on this and you fill out your name, for each of these. So potentially, we could take one experience from this bucket. This is the this is the heal your self personal development bucket. This is the I am enough meditation. She has a book called I am enough. This could be a big one because that could also support the book. So my questions to them would be which of these produce the most revenue. And then we would take this automation or sorry this hypnosis and automate a four or five day email based experience for this. And also do the same thing for their free gifts. Let me see where that was the free gift. Okay, here's the opt in for the training courses, which is essentially just a prospectus that or a guide that it can opt in for. But we can take either their prospectus or their guide and then turn that into an experience that's delivered over time so that people can determine if being a therapist is right for them. So that being said, that right now they're pulling, based on our previous conversation, they're pulling a lot of their therapists from those who go through the personal development track and they say, hey, this would be really fun to make money with. And so there's a bridge that goes from the personal development track to the certified therapist track. And that is, is this right for me? My, my sister-in-law is a, she's a fangirl of Marissa. to like hardcore fan girl. This is almost all she can talk about. It's wild. And she's the kind of know it all girl that, you know, she has a solution to everything that yells you. And she's been considering this, but she's still on the fence. So it's an interesting ecosystem. They have, here's their book of call, which is literally just a book of call. this apply now just goes to their certificate or their $4,500 course for their, they call it certification. So is only $4,500 and they have a $15,000 like business in a box version of that. based on what I understand. Anyway, here is the shop just to get a real quick overview. They sell bundles of hypnosis audios. And each one of these kind of has its own little bucket. It is very unclear which of these does the best other than best seller bundle. And then here they categorize these based on the buckets that they serve love and relationship, health, overcoming addictions, personal development, wealth and success, weight management. And these trainings are our courses. So there's also these other foundation certificate for hypnotherapy. um, foundation certificate for rapid transformational therapy, I guess you can get started for 240 bucks. Um, confident coach, certificate and applied and this is the one videos. They have trainings and then they have a certification and then a business and a box $15,000 thing. Uh, sold via phone call and live events, most likely. And also have a couple of webinars. I didn't mention that. Um, I don't really want to touch a webinar, but, uh, they have one. So it seems to me like the, the better questions would be which one makes them the most money. Um, is $39 a month, their current focus, if it is, why don't we turn their current assets into an automated evergreen experience that upsells people into the $39 month thing at a very, very high rate. At $39 a month, based on their current price points of their hypnosis audios and people going through the hypnosis, conversion rates gonna be really, really good. I wouldn't be shocked to have 15, 20, 30% in terms of immersion. So, this to me would be, I think we can be reasonable in our... communication of expectations. But to me, this would be a home run. I can't imagine not hitting a home run with this. This is right in my house.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's so you have to keep in mind what their goal is is to break the $20 million ceiling. And that's really difficult to do with the low ticket offer. So there's more to it than that. So here's some questions that I have. And I'm going to give you a stop your screen sharing I'll share from in a just a basic little thing. And just share some questions with you. But I'm going to show them to you so that you can visualize it as my share. So these are the things that we want to know because there's several different things. And I broke this down. What's the right down at your revenue? But percentage of your revenue comes from each offer. You can see the power in understanding that, right? How much of it from? But we need to know from everything, even if it's only 2% comes from weight loss. need to know all of it. Chances are pretty good that they won't know off the top of their heads how much they might have a guess. And so the next question is, what effort is applied to each offer, meaning what ads, landing pages, just follow up sequence, what did they focus on? We need to ask these questions and also get a read on their answers. So you can ask them ahead of time on the call. But I'll get to this in a second. Do you have any Google or any other kind of analytics? We will need access to that. What things are you wanting to do less of and why? For example, Brian wants to do, Brian Kurtz wants to do less events. He's hitting an age. And that's why, because he's just, he's tired. And so it wouldn't surprise me if this is something that they want to do less of also. What do you want to do more of, and why? I would imagine they want to do more of a scalable thing, because they're getting older. we don't want to leave the question. We want them to answer, and we want them to answer honestly. And why we're going to find the gold and the magic is where what they have gets optimized with and overlay what they want, where they want to go. So let's say that the primary, and this will be the biggest issue, and the biggest hurdle, if the primary source of their revenue is live events where they sell people into becoming a therapist and becoming certified. that's what they want to do less than. That's a problem. Now, there are a couple ways to look at this. So it's a problem meaning that's the thing that's already working and they want to do less on it. What you don't know is what the onus is that they're putting on you. Is it Seth, I saw your thing that you do and I want that or is it that I need to break a 20 million dollar a year ceiling. They seem like the same goal to them probably, but they're two separate things because you're not necessarily saying that that's the thing that we can do, especially if when they think that in their mind, they're thinking he can get us to do that without us doing the thing that we're already doing. But it's much more difficult. Let's say they're selling that for 10,000. or $15,000 or $20,000 or whatever, and they want to cut that source off, and now, like, how many sales do you have to make at $39 a month to recover one $20,000 sale? It's ridiculous, right? how much traffic exists right now? Do you even have the potential to be able to do that? So then, here's the thing, what they may be able to do is transfer what they've been doing at events to a lesser degree through your email automation sequence, so partly the selling and the transition from, I've been taking it, now I want to do it. Or I took a career path and I was doing this thing, and now I want to do this thing. So figuring out, whatever their highest revenue thing is and figuring out how to make that experiential. So let's say that their biggest source of revenue and audience and fan base is their events and it's because they what people tend to pay most for is two things results and access. Access doesn't have to have results. Access is I get to say I met so and so I get to say I get to take a picture with someone so people will do that because they think it makes them look big better so people will pay big money even if they get no results out of it just to go see these people so that's something right. But the other thing is results so there's there's another play where you don't necessarily get access but you can say I went through the same thing that John asked or after it or Jim quick or whatever, or you can see you learn from them because they're your mentors because you took a masterclass with them, that type of thing. It's the psychology and the angle behind all of it. the other thing is how much does it cost then to put on those events? Well, if they're paying for those speakers and chances are pretty good that they're paying money for their speakers because of who they have on them. Generally those level of speakers you're paying for them because they're not doing it for free. It's part of their job. They get paid to speak like Marissa gets paid to speak. So how much money does it cost them to put on their events and then how many times are they doing events? Actually, let's go look at and what's the conversion rate and what's the the revenue. So Let's see, these are physical events, three in April, two in May, two in June, nothing in July and August, one in September. So that's a lot of events and that's a lot of traveling. And let's say that whatever, like you could put a price on how much the event costs, how much time it takes to do and how much set up. And then you've got a conversion right on top of that and how many people actually get into it. So what if, and you can only put so many people into event because of cost, because of travel, because of location. But what if the events could be either their virtual or something else where they're not having to actually spend as much money or as much time organizing it and it's maybe It's an evergreen thing, and maybe they can't because it's not as experiential can't charge as much, but maybe they can get two or three as many people in there, and the conversion rate might be less, or the price is less, but because they can get more people into it because it's less cost prohibitive, and because it's not location prohibitive and all these other things, and then your, so let's say it's a two-day event, three-day event, let's see, these are four-day events, that's crazy, that's a one-day event, that's a four-day event, that's a one-day event, that's four-day event, so they have one-on-four-day events. Let's say for the four-day event, you know, you break it across three weeks, like event, it's immersive, and it's super... accountable, right? It's like, did you show up for this? Did you do this thing? Did you show up to the thing? Did you do this thing all the way through? And so there's a potential that they could replace their events or even, you know, let's say they replaced half their events at their age. That's a big deal. If they only did, you know, event at a quarter and so they could charge more money for it because they're doing it less, then it's a lot less stress to them, a lot less effort, less cost, but they can charge higher prices and get maybe more premium level people because they're still offering this, they're just doing it in a different way. I think that that's an angle that you could bring. I think also, if they don't have a CMO, like, that actually does a really good job, that is talking to them about scaling and other opportunities and leveraging. I think that that is kind of, yeah, who is it though? How good are they doing? Because they feel stuck and they're not leveraging their email list. all the things that you said, you're seeing them all dropping them off.
00:27:17 - Seth Ellsworth
a Dobson.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and how long has she been with them?
00:27:26 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not sure.
00:27:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, if I'm a CMO, I'm not letting my people not do their email stuff and not be managing all of these things. So, you know, there's an angle of, do you want some more help? let's just like call yourself something. are you a scaling expert? you a retention expert? You're the completion. experts, but you have more gifts to bring to the table and a team who has other gifts to bring to the table and a $100,000 offer that you want to make. So I'm just telling, I'm just trying to help you figure out like what are some of the things that you could do and also learn from this in terms of like what people need. Generally, getting to this eight-figure business level, I can't even tell you, I've got one, my eight-figure attorney, how much is just left on the table and it's just, it's a slow walk, but it's a steady walk upwards, way less time working, way more money, and we don't have to change a lot. eight-figure people for the most part get it and you need them to get the help, they go get the help, like it's a whole different ball game than bottom seven figure people, like low seven figure people, which is what, you know, most, I can barely make six figures, even wrap their hands around, I think seven figures is great, but on a business level, low seven figure people are a lot of times just still struggling. Just, they got there by dumb luck a lot of times, or just by hustle and grit. Now, to get to eight figures, you have to have learned some things. A lot of that can still be hustled and grit. Like, it's really hard for people who aren't operating in the space to have any idea what it actually looks like. But, you know, showing up at events, there's a particular look they have, conversations they have, like, you just know that it's charisma, personality, obviously the psychology behind it, what they know, NLP, things like that. They know how to persuade people to do things. He also can teach and give real skills. It doesn't mean that they're great at business and optimizing things. And they know that, which is a key opportunity for you because you do understand conversions and conversion rates and how to combine. And also, I mean, it's just perfect because they understand the psychology behind it too. And you can ask them, you know, are you applying everything that you know about psychology to your email sequences? Answer is no, 100% the answer is no, right? So how much more powerful would your stuff be if you walked the walk, right? So you just show them the things that are left on the table. So going back to this, what percentage of, what do you call it? What's the breakdown of your revenue? What do you wanna do more of? What do you wanna do less of? That's gonna be really huge. And then where's the money coming from? from, and how do we leverage existing assets, traffic, et cetera, to break the $20 million dollar ceiling? And so, what have they been doing? Have they, even having to do more just to keep hitting the $20 million, they probably have, right?
00:31:53 - Seth Ellsworth
Because they're suffering just like most people.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, right, exactly. how would it feel Also, is it what is the ultimate financial goal, retiring, selling, because we want to understand, you know, what it's going back to what are they want to talk to you about, like, says, stay in your lane, just build us an email sequence. So we've got to be really clear on that. do you want me to just talk about how I can build you an email sequence and off to the biases, or would you like to really go into kind of a business audit and an opportunity on it for. What, what I see that you could be doing and. you know, there's that. So that's a conversation. These conversations, these questions, you could ask ahead of time, maybe fill that out, pray about it, and we can meet again on Thursday if you do end up talking to them at all, or Friday, go in and start asking questions. But at the end, have a pitch to make because, and also, is it increasing wood, increasing margins, even if top line dropped a little bit, but bottom line room. is our goal. Especially if it's scaling. and lower barrier to entry. So it means it should continue to be scalable and growing like the, you know, $39 a month offer. Because what I think that the offer is, is that we do two things. We figure out how to experience, like email experience if I. What we're doing in their events. And then also. Apply the same treatment to whatever their other top two top three offers are. So that's a lot of work that's ongoing. But. Most of the work is in analyzing their data. Which. we can do together. Chris is actually also very good at that. The automations, so we're definitely going to want what's his face, but we can also probably go hire other people. And I can help you with that and we can do that on the call together and just go look for people together. And then I have a whole process for hiring and testing people. We can do that together too because we're going to want more people than that. If we're creating this offer and doing it more. And then Chris would be writing the copy which he'll be paid for.
00:35:40 - Seth Ellsworth
We might have to find somebody else besides Matthew because he's tapped out.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find other people. promise that there are other people who are amazing at automations and they're just quietly working for other people because they're not. They don't want to run a business. I just want to get paid doing their thing. My experience with hiring people this year compared to even just three years ago, night and day difference, I'm shocked at what they know because the world has just changed that much, especially since COVID, in understanding online business. So the resources are massively increased. So I'm not worried about that, we shouldn't be. With Copy, if Chris can't do it, we've got a whole bunch of people to tap and we can tap through him or, again, we can go out and hire. whatever has to be built, the biggest thing is that we need to have the money for it in the sale. So it needs to be, this should for sure be $100,000, not 75, and with a potential growth. So let's say that $100,000 covers the email. experience of their live events, plus one other thing that leads up to the selling the live events. So it's like a breakthrough challenge. Obviously, that's right, right. And if it's not, then we plug in the things that are. So either way, what I'm saying is that we do something that is akin to building them a breakthrough challenge and T three, right? So it's the small thing that leads to the big thing and it's all an email sequence. And the goal is to do that in a quarter, but you have to build it and then you have to, and that may take longer than three months, depending on how long it takes them to get us all of their material. And you need just tell them that, you know, like, if you could hand everything over to us the same week that we close the deal, then, you know, 90 days we could do this. But the odds are that most people take a while to hand everything over, and it takes a few weeks, takes about four weeks, a lot of time to get all the stuff. So they'll send you stuff, and then you'll say, I see a gap, and then you ask for it, you send a request, and then it takes them a few days, and then they send it back. So there's this whole process. The first 30 days is really just a transfer of access to things that we need. Then you have to create the framework and say, this is what I think it should be, and go back to them and say, do you agree with that? That's another roughly about three weeks, and then you start to build it roughly about six weeks. So that's where we're at with the 90 days, and... And then, so is it like, once we get all the everything that we need is 90 days from there? No. Or 90 days total, factoring in, it could take up to a month to get everything we need. Yes. And if it takes longer than that, then it pushes our timeline out. And we're talking 90 days from the first iteration for the first iteration. So then it has to actually be sold and we put people through it. And then we have to see how it's doing and watch it. So that's another 90 days, because it takes time to get that feedback going. It takes time to see if something's stopping them and then we tweak it. So really, we're looking at a six month runway to make sure that we build, launch, and optimize the first level. of whatever it is that we built. So the six month thing allows some fluidity between the 90 days, you know, it doesn't have to be exactly 90 days that we launched it. The bottom line is after six months, you've got something and we've optimized it and by now you should be getting your money back if what we're doing is applying the email treatment to the thing that makes them the most money. So but they don't have sales copy for that. So they do for a live event but it's an angle. So there's a lot to be built. So the hundred thousand dollars is we're building this giant thing that replaces what you're already doing and it's scalable but also we're building the feeder into it. we'll be building the copy for it. We're going to, we're not going to just give it to you and say, look, we're going to give it to you and watch it with you. We're going to give it to you and make sure that it's working. Whatever is not working, we're going to fix. And we're going to stay here until you get your money back from your investment with us. And that shouldn't be a hard scary thing for us because it's just doing, I mean, this is stuff I do regularly. This is what chris us regularly. We look at the offers, we take, tweak it and test it. So let's do the map, you know, if you, hold on a second, if we sell it for $100,000 to buy a buy.
00:41:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Is that one other, one other thing that I think is a big little mover for John, like he wants his team to be top notch. And I get, I get the fee feeling that his CEO, Skip Johnson, and Amanda Dobson are new. I think he wants, I think he wants them to be trained. So that is another level of this. like, Hey, we're 100 K and 30 K per. Order, like we'll be fixing this optimizing it, making sure your team is fully capable of running with it and the understanding the strategy behind it because we've taught them what we've done and why. So that they could potentially build other assets without us.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, effectively, effectively working ourselves out of a job. So then maybe you sell it for it's 100 K plus for 90 days. And then it's. 150k for six months, which is a lot less for the follow-up, and we'll train your team. They can show up to all the calls where we are working together and diving into this. We will explain it. We will document it through a loom process of, look, this is what we built. This is the psychology behind it. This is how we analyzed it. This is why it's working. These are the things, the team that we need, you need an automation person, you need a copy person. We can tell you how to hire these people, you potentially, we'll do that. I think that's the, because honestly, an extra $50,000 for the three-month-light positioning at that way, 100k, it's 90 days. This is everything that we're building, and we're going to need, you know, An omniscience people were gonna have two copywriters like there's a lot to be built and and outline what has to be built Right, so there's the landing pages. There's the sales pages. There's the follow-up sequences that Nurture the people who didn't purchase from the landing page to the cell page For however many weeks and then there's the actual experience that is replacing a live event So you're talking about high-level Strategy that we're applying it to going through all of your material Making sure that we're choosing the best stuff and then turning it into experience like that is a lot of Mental work and we're paying high-level people to do it You mean Chris whoever else you know, we're we're looking at the stuff. So that's that's a lot and Then on top of that rather than building your dependency And then upon us, you know, obviously you're going to want to keep this skill and how as much as you can, we'll train your people to do it. And it won't really be an extra step. We're not going to say we're going to certify your people doing it, right, that they can do it. We're just going to make sure that they've got everything they need, which will be easy because what we're doing, if you want your clients to be really happy and you want to be able to get a raving testimonial, but you have to show them what you've done. have to show your work. So we'll create loom videos where we go through and say, here's everything we've done and broke it down so that they know and then we'll show them the data like, here was your baseline data. Here's what you were making. Here's this new offer. a completely new offer, right? Here's the revenue it's made. So we'll have evidence to show them so that they're like, I'm very happy I paid this money with you. I can see your results. That same material will work to train. There are other people because we'll show them this is what we did.
00:46:01 - Seth Ellsworth
This is the details of what we did.
00:46:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's one action, two benefits, and but also two values. We're not selling them on the reporting. It's just what's going to happen. We're selling them on training their team, but training their team is going to happen as a result of the reporting.
00:46:25 - Seth Ellsworth
Seven cents. Yep. So really just high level questions first about what's driving the revenue and then what do they want more of? What do they want less of? Customize our pitch to either that event based thing or selling the $39 thing for whatever reasons they want. then the offer under K over 90 days done for you 30k per quarter from there on out. Just stay on as long as they want. All this based on the fact that they want more revenue, they want less time spent, less resources spent, most likely, and their email game is currently abysmal.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Non-existent.
00:47:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, so let's say their angle is, like for us, we also have quick wins, for example, when somebody opts in to anything, we just add the little reply trick, and that is a forced multiplier for the health of their email list as a whole, which is huge. They have a huge, huge list. I don't think it's efficient. I don't think they have access to their whole list, because it doesn't seem that they're the email very well, but they do have a very big audience on social media.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have lots of assets. So, that's something else that you could bring down, like if you're going to do a... atomized invoice, the email health and an email audit, you could call it, but you can put a price point on that and you have to, you can put down why it matters, why it's necessary, you know, so if they're like, well, what is it? Because most of time, the biggest thing that you'll get, so people that pay the most expect the least, the difference is, what am I getting for my money? That's a conversation that you'll have. What does my $100,000 get? People with the least amount of money, they want to be told you're going to make X amount of dollars with it, right? They don't want that atomized details. They want to know the mouthwatering details. People that pay a lot of money just want the bullet list because they can look at the value themselves. So the email audits, why it banners, you can break it down, open rights, conversion rights, follow up sequences, inbox placement, email help, all of these things are, and you can say like how much money do you spend on email, on your email holds, how big is your list, like how much money are you bleeding, and I don't know how much you want to get involved into it, but if you're going to be doing an email sequence, I would imagine that needs to be part of your service anyway, which is going and getting their sender score, and figuring out getting a report, you know, what's their domain health, what's their domain score, where are they emailing from, all of that, an email audit should be built into it, and it should be high value. So that, you know, look if I'm going to have you build all these emails, are they even going to get to the inbox? of your people, and what types, like where are you sending from, all these things. Anyway, so an itemized invoice of here's the copy, here's the automations, I don't know if you want to do that, I don't know, we really have to think about that, and I think looking at it will help us make a decision. Do we do it that way, or do we not put a price point next one, but say these are the things that we're going to do, email audit, write the copy, here's the types of copy that we're going to be doing, X amount of landing pages, a range of landing pages, a range of email follow-up sequences that are solely to ascend the opt-in person, the lead to sales, and then the email experience is a whole separate thing, right? That is the primary chunk of of everything. But for the email experience to work right and to work best, it means all of these other pieces into it. And then there's the analyzing, right? The iterations and optimizations, all the things that happen. So if you're putting together an itemized list and you're not putting, I would not put a price next to each of the things, but I would create an invoice. And this really should be your offer. And it will be specific to them, but you'll be able to model it for other people because it's going to be very, very, very similar, right? Which is these are the things that we're offering. So the small thing that leads to the big thing, so that there's a whole ascension process, the $39 all the way up to whatever the, become a certified, whatever, RTT. person, a therapist, in that thing, in their specific skill sets, in their therapy, that's telling me my brain right now. I'm also looking at like all their different words and things on the page while I'm looking at this, my brain is reading one word and saying another. Anyway, that's what it should be, so we should have that ready in a Google Doc, so we show up, we ask them all the questions, and ask them the questions. Basically, it's going to solidify what we already know, and it may allow us to tweak, so plan on some conversation back and forth between you and I in the background, as the call is happening, and then we give them the offer, and you have to decide what you want the price point to be, it's $100,000 $150,000. But the burden is that you have to convince them that they're going to get their money back and grow from it. Because, I mean, why spend their time if all they're going to do is just get their money back. They need it to grow. needs to be more than what they put in time and energy. Coming out with a better marketing team as a result of it, because you've gone through and got data. So, you're going to want to ask these questions. And are there marketing people going to be there on the call, do you know?
00:53:40 - Seth Ellsworth
So far as I know, I'm at Adopson and Skip Johnson, the CEO and the CMO, are as well as Marissa and John Davies are to be on there. Okay.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, we're going to want to ask very specific questions, which will reveal what they know. they don't. So we're going to want to ask, okay, um, do you have a heat map on your pages? What percentage, like, okay, how much traffic do you get?
00:54:11 - Seth Ellsworth
Hold on a second. Where's my question? can figure that out.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can figure what out.
00:54:16 - Seth Ellsworth
The heat map. I can just find the code on there.
00:54:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you're missing the point. That's not the point. The point is we want to show what they know. So, um, do you have a heat map? It's a focus on what the point is there. Heat map. How many unique visitors per month? What's the bounce rate?
00:54:45 - Seth Ellsworth
What's the bounce rate?
00:54:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did people say? Do people stay on site? primary traffic sources, and what's the average time per landing page version great for offer. For average part value, per offer, or TV, per customer, per channel, per offer. Guarantee you they don't know these answers, almost nobody does. If they know them, they have an amazing marketing team, but we know that they don't have an amazing marketing team, because if they did, they'd be doing a better job of emailing, right? Okay, so what these questions are going to reveal is your marketing team isn't looking at what they need to do again, because the marketing team is going to be there and they're not going to have the answers. So if you don't know these things, do you have analytics we can review because we need days answers to optimize what you're doing. So that allows you to add in to your value offer, and you can cut it if you don't need it, but it should already be in a Google Doc with everything that we're offering, which is because we will train your marketing team on how to... make sure that you're optimizing all of your sources and that they know all of these things, but also they can review the results of your marketing efforts to make sure that each of these things that we're looking at is at optimal levels. And you just, that's just part of your value stack up. Here's the price point, but here's all the things that we're gonna get. So you're gonna, all these questions should reveal numbers and data and all that data should sell your offer for you.
00:57:43 - Seth Ellsworth
Seems to me we'd have to send all this stuff prior to.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you just have to have it written ahead of time because if you send it prior to, you miss the opportunity of revealing what's not known because they, their people can go scramble and look for these things. You need the CEO to know that their people don't know this stuff. And you need everybody to be exposed on the call that they don't know this stuff. So because they need to hire you. They know they need to hire you. they don't want to do is pay the price. What they don't want to do, their team doesn't want to be exposed. It's not knowing it. Why aren't you doing this? But what they want most is to break that $20 million a year ceiling and work less hard and have the money that they want to have. If they want those results, they have to get out of their own way. Why didn't they get out their own way to begin with? Because nobody confronted them with what they need to see.
00:58:56 - Seth Ellsworth
All right. Can you send me that? Nope. Can you copy it over?
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah So we have a looking at the Looking at the calendar invite we have a total of a half an hour Yeah, do you think they're gonna want to stop talking to you so if they do like first of all you ask all these questions really quickly when you have them And if your pitch is prepared you can get to them quickly I'm just posting it in the bottom of your work flow. You can move it put it wherever you want to so Eat the Having less time can just mean that they're foaming at the mouse dinner because they're like holy crap They just showed us everything we don't have and Everything we don't have is clearly why we're not getting where we want to be They also just showed us how they can give it to us and they're gonna they their brain's going to need to close that loop. Either we're hiring them or we're not. But if we are, then we need to figure this out if we need it, we need to get there.
01:00:10 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, and you can tell them, look, only take on one of these a quarter. So, you know, I just want to, I think that this is ideal. I love what you're doing. I love what you're teaching people. You know, here's why I think what you do matters and why I want to be a part of it. And here's why I think what you're doing matters and why the world needs more of you. And here's what we're going to do to get that for you. also to make sure that you've got enough energy to keep serving because people need you. And this is how we're going to make it less work so that you can conserve that energy. We'll build this experience that can keep going. Even when you can't like that.
01:01:09 - Seth Ellsworth
I got those notes. A couple of thoughts. Thing number one, I'm just looking at my pension to way over deliver. I look at their four buckets that they have on their freebie page. They're four different audios. And I'm like, well, why don't we just build a four or five six day thing for each of those. And then, but that's four of these, which is four times the work.
01:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's your upsell after we've done what we're going to do. If you want to keep working with them. And if you don't, you can just say, hey, here's what I recommend. Go apply what we've taught you to each of these. Have your team do it.
01:02:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you want to consult with me?
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's a fee for consulting on it, and we'll have your team build it, but this my recommendation to you It's not where you should focus because you want to make them more money Right, so either way we should just focus on one of these channels one experience That we have a high probability of being home run because that's where most of the revenue is already coming from And then the 30 the 30k per quarter is essentially just for oversight and consulting And you don't want to package up like that. No Because they'll know if you say that they're gonna be like why am I paying that much for oversight and consulting?
01:02:52 - Seth Ellsworth
No So how do I How How do I not
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Stell myself into a corner why offering what I just told you so to me that leaves like a it leaves like a okay then what do we build next why are you even thinking about that i don't know it's more my mind naturally goes oh that's your problem you keep trying to extend things when instead of letting them finish and be done right maybe probably because i care more about the recurring revenue oh i was just about to tell you that's exactly what it is because you're like i got to pay the next month's bill you don't need to look at them for doing that so if you sell this and if you sell another one or two to other people with ending right and you want it to end because that's your wow factor and your wow factor is what gives you the big price points. You don't want to stay in somebody's team. You don't want to stay in their business. We let them come back to you for one-off consulting or something or whatever, but just go in, do the wow, then leave and leave them wild. So they keep telling people about your wow factor. But don't get in the grind of their business and having to and feeling like you're a part of their team, because then you lose the leverage that that gives you your price point, but also the energy and the way that they see you. And it's important for everything that you're doing with your high level people that that's how that stays, that dynamic stays that way. The money that we get from this needs to be budgeted so that there's money going to building out your own scalable office. That's where your next money is coming from. It's not from here. There is a very clear ending process we build the thing we leave if you want more you can ask us for more We'll give you a price point and it's not going to be stressed And you're not going to be built into a thing to be only thing that you're going to do from this point is consults Because we'll we'll tell you your team how to do it if you want to pay a higher price We'll even go hire people for your team to put in there and we'll teach them, but there's always an ending period So in this scenario, you wouldn't You wouldn't do a Risk reversal scenario where you'd say hey, it's a hundred K We'll stick around until you double that Sure, I would and there's no reason not to because that's not building you into a truck Because there's no way there's not enough potential for that money and
01:06:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Do you think it would be silly to to go for some type of a percentage?
01:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because this is the first time you've even tried this offer. Get some, get some evidence under your belt, get some more experience. Now you can do it at the end and say, if you want to keep me, here's how you can do it. It's a percentage.
01:06:27 - Seth Ellsworth
Because if that were the upsell instead of the 30k per quarter, that's a hell yes.
01:06:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I don't even know where you got the 30k per quarter afterwards. No, the first like $100,000 for the, no, actually it was the response to yours. Like we go through and look at the transcript. When I was looking at, if you want to make it $150,000 for six months, and it wasn't considered Salting it was 30k per quarter. Basically we're building out these things. It wasn't like that.
01:07:05 - Seth Ellsworth
It wasn't 30 paper quarter for consulting I'm not sure where that came from Yeah Um, I would love to do 100k for building one of these and then they pay a percentage for us to go in and build out the other three That would be awesome Or four or five or six of these Okay, well don't get ahead of yourself because you've never had a yes on this offer at all No, I haven't And never built it Yeah, that's an end zone that I would that's an end zone that I would love for this particular business because It is A high degree of confidence with this one Um Well, there's so many unknowns including managing the team and and doing the whole thing together So I really want you to focus on what we've already talked about Yep, I'm part of minimizing it putting it on one
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
clear offer was to start to finish and I'm not going it would be cool if like just don't do that because that can sabotage everything if we get through this and then you want to be it would be cool all day long go do that but first you need a confident sale that you can close that you can take care of the family with you can have a team that you can build out your own offer which is going to take your time and focus and and be very very very practical with this there's lots of time for it would be cool if later and there'll be lots of opportunities but right now it just needs to be here's the offer here is that we can just knock it out of the park and this is what we're going to do for it cool and then in terms of price points like how do how do we be
01:09:00 - Seth Ellsworth
that we haven't taken swing yet. How do we confidently value this?
01:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build out what I told you, which is the, like, itemized invoice that doesn't have a price point on it, right? But here's all the thing you're building. So quickly, repeat back to me what I said we're building.
01:09:20 - Seth Ellsworth
You asking me that or is that what I should ask them?
01:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you.
01:09:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Well, I don't know exactly because it would be slightly different depending on whether it's the event based version or the low ticket front end.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It should not be the low ticket front end and you shouldn't give them that option. If you want to knock it out of the park, you mean tell them let's experience it by your event into an email experience. But to build up to that, we'll take one of the low ticket options to build up to that and bridge a gap because if you want to get your money back, then There has to be high level stuff if you're trying to get if you're gonna be there till they get their money back at a $100,000 with a $39 offer you can be there forever Certainly they have six hundred thousand people on their email list Yeah, how many people do you think actually open it and how many people are even still valid email?
01:10:19 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't know anything about their email help I don't But you can assume it's crap We can assume it's crap. They're also flying ads and they have very active socials. So there's a lot of available to them Okay, so how many thirty nine? Here's here's how I see this taking Taking their hypnosis audios that they're currently giving away as a lead magnet Turning that into an automated email-based experience that converts it 30% to the $39 thing That's easy. That would be a very very simple simple thing, taking a live event and automating that to get the same result as or some result, no, not even similar, doesn't have to be someone that's either way, taking a live event and putting it into this type of a structure much more difficult. Is it possible?
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
course it is.
01:11:23 - Seth Ellsworth
It's much better.
01:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bottom line is done right up today because we need to have time to tweak it. The itemized, what the invoice would be. So you asked, how do I confidently sell that $100,000? This is how. If you can't write it out and look at that and go, hell yeah, that's a $100,000 offer and also it's not going to be a whole ton of work for me because I'm having other people do it, then there you go. And if you can't do that, maybe you don't need to have a call for it. So write it up send it over Thursday.
01:12:02 - Seth Ellsworth
can work on Tweaking it and make sure we've got it nailed down and then probably see what happens Yeah, I think I think we should probably be prepared for Both options the event based one or the That the hypnosis audio version That seems to me that they're right there. I'm just Green with the way you just said It seems to you what it seems to me that if they've turned their focus to the thirty nine dollar a month thing for whatever reason So they've spent a lot of money all ready To to grow that It'll be interesting to see What their priorities are versus where they're currently generating their revenue, which has got to be the events To me it make that makes the most that's you're going to make more $15,000 sales from the event than you are from any other, they're not doing any other marketing. So it has to be from the events. What is it already wise? Is it the event or is it this new $39 thing? That'll be interesting because the revenue won't likely justify focusing on the $39 thing, like you said. But they may see that as their path to getting off the hamster wheel. I don't know.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so to break even on a $100,000 investment in us on the $39 offer, we need about 2,500 sales. But if there's an episode, if there's something else next, $1,000 or $2,000 offer, and maybe it's something in becoming a therapist or whatever the next step is. There's some gap that we don't know about that exists, some mid-level offer that is not an event that we're replacing, but it could be the training or whatever, maybe a certification process or pre-certification process where you can sell it for, whether it's a few hundred or a thousand or two thousand, you know, the burden on that, $100,000, a hundred people buying $1,000 offer, and with that amount of traffic that they have, that's a no-brainer like that. We could do that easily. So I think that there's a missing piece there that we could plug in, which was one of the things I was thinking about before, and I don't remember how $39 members to $15,000 sales. Well, are they getting $39 members to $15,000?
01:14:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Sure they are, because he mentioned that the whole point of that group. It was to nurture them, to ascend to the bigger things.
01:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there, and there could be segments, you know, are there different types of things that they teach? they teach one thing, and so maybe they ascend them up through, instead of going straight to the $15,000 thing, it's, well, there's this aspect, right? This is, let us teach you about CBT, it's $1,000, let us teach you about the hemotherapy, it's $1,000, you know, and step them up through something. There's a path, and there's missing data points, where we can do that, but what they need to understand is that your way of doing it isn't just email, it's a very specific way based off of psychology, which they should appreciate that speaks to them, and uses, know, accountability, and actually is very much CBT, because it's getting into the head, like, who are you, what do you want, why are you doing what you're doing, are you watching? yourself behave the way you're behaving, is it getting you the outcome that you want? No, it's not. So you need to change your behavior. So here's how you change your behavior and changing your behavior is, you know, leaving them through a sale at the same time. That's what you've been doing. It is very related to CBT, which is observing your behavior, asking yourself if the current behavior that you have is getting the results that you want or not. And if it's not, then what are some options for how you can behave to get more of what you want. And then as you're watching yourself, are you seeing yourself through the right thing? Do the wrong thing? we get fixed it? That's it? That's the cognitive behavior there. It's a repeat.
01:16:56 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. Awesome. By the way, I have heard back from Landon Ray.
01:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have or have not?
01:17:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I have.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And?
01:17:10 - Seth Ellsworth
He agreed to the 10K thing.
01:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the 10K thing?
01:17:16 - Seth Ellsworth
Just a power day at onto Port Campus in June.
01:17:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
01:17:23 - Seth Ellsworth
So he's, I need to send him a one pager and he'll send, he'll get his accounting to send 5K and then 5K on the day of.
01:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
01:17:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So we've got some movement somewhere.
01:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, I think for the most part, this week you've got, I know you have things that you have to fulfill and you need to get prepared for this. I don't know what else you have going on, but I would like to know what else you're going on. an appointment I need to get to. So I need to wrap up. But I think that this is going to go well. Either they're actually open to making the changes or not, but based off of the conversations that's happened so far, I would say that they are. And if you can just show them how, you know, this just makes perfect sense, but also clearly they need to stop chasing it. That conversation about, how much basically, how much harder have you had to work to get to that 20,000? Are you just coasting or have you had to work harder just to keep hitting that $20 million? And if you've had to keep working harder, how long can you do that? if 20 million is the number and you can't keep chasing harder and harder and harder, then you have to go smarter. this is what we've got, and you know, break it all down. It'll be important to Like, at some point, guaranteed, I've never been to a call where there wasn't something that was high value that I could add to it. They need to be primed for just even listening. So decide how you want to represent me. But it works best if you've done that ahead of time. This is Tina. This is what she's bringing to the table. So if I ask a question, because everybody's ego is a little bit different. I don't imagine they're going to be high ego people, but it could be. Um, so it's sometimes people like who knows this and why they ask them questions. So it's best to avoid that by pre-framing this, who she is. That's what she does.
01:19:46 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep. I already, I think I already did that past. Yeah. And my, in my original email, which you didn't see. Um, I said, I don't do anything without. her. She keeps from painting myself into a corner.
01:20:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. That's enough. So that way, if there's there's anything I want to help out with, and I'm just like, I know I can add some power value to here, then then it'll be there for the most part. I'm just going to be quiet supporting and texting back and forth. But if I sense that there's a way that I'm like, okay, well, I can answer this question powerfully and clearly, then I'll do that.
01:20:28 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. I'll bring you in. Would you want me to, is this like a tag team thing, or would you just hop in? Meaning like, hey, Tina can speak to that.
01:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would probably just hop in. wouldn't even want to be to recall if I'm not hopping in, because then I can't be myself. And if I can't be myself, I don't want to be there.
01:20:55 - Seth Ellsworth
Awesome. So I will work on this invoice for both scenarios.
01:21:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because then you'll have an option. can just say you, without them knowing, just pick the one you want to show that and then go ahead and screen show so they can take look at it and break it down.
01:21:13 - Seth Ellsworth
If I had, if I had my druthers, what I would do for them, this would be, this is their entire business model. They have four of these running with their most successful four verticals that have proven to be the most profitable. They drive all of their traffic to those four. Those dump $39 per month members and then quickly ascends those who have achieved a high level of confidence with that and introduces the opportunity for a career with those things. Or it assesses their need for deeper therapy. And so all roads lead through this $1.39 month thing that liquefies at costs and makes it infinitely scalable, and we just pick people off and push them down each, each path based on, you know, any number of things that could happen. But we could build one of these to go on the inside that ascends them into the career.
01:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and the great thing about this is that this is the type of thing that is perpetual evergreen lifelong. So whether you need therapy or you need to keep sharpening your own saw and being better at what you're doing. Come back to us as the authority for people that can help you, you know, continue your mental health journey, being as strong as you possibly can. So you live with us forever. That's the goal, right? Or, or same thing as becoming a therapist because the bottom line. as we all know that we need support and we're here to offer that to you. So whatever we need built is perpetual. mean evergreen not in terms of an offer that never expires but also your potential to stay with us as a customer lasts forever as well. And so we want to make sure that we show them that hey we're looking at it that way and we know that. And so one of the goals and the metrics would be life's and value their customer whatever is we want to increase that and extend that. And what you do says in the nurturing through email sequence has the greatest potential to do what should have already been on their radar and probably already the goal but probably not their success in the past.
01:23:48 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
01:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got to go but send me over what you come up with in your two versions and then we'll just you keep hammering that out. But I imagine that you'll probably show up to that call more confident that you have in any other cell call, even though it's the highest, like, have you ever sold any one thing for $100,000 for yourself?
01:24:15 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, I sold a website for 220.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm about like this service something.
01:24:22 - Seth Ellsworth
No.
01:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, selling a website or business is a whole different thing. This is selling you as a service, um, doing this particular thing that there's been a lot of, well, just a huge lack of clarity and confidence. So going into this success way is a big deal. But I, your confidence seems to be growing and the clarity growing almost daily, definitely weekly. And I think that you have the potential just to go in and knock it out of the park Friday.
01:24:58 - Seth Ellsworth
Thank you. I was just saying, I think we can ROI these guys before we even build anything.
01:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Build anything before we build anything. Well, I don't know how, how you would do that without doing something. What do you mean? Well, I mean, before we build the experience, just, okay, don't say anything and then say the experience, but yeah, build that thing like just with a few tweaks, maybe you say that, but the language matters very much because that's almost like we can get your money back without doing anything. That's what it sounds like.
01:25:42 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. that's not what I'm.
01:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So anyway, so like you could say something like where I think we can ROI just by making a few actually simple tweaks that we can implement into your system within a couple of days. that can start, you know, getting you money while we're building the big thing. The language is different, it takes more, but it's factual, and it's clear. You know it's clear because it's reflected as email, you know, and improved this type of thing, and that doesn't take a lot of effort. But that clarity makes a big difference because when you're not there, you create confusion. Confusion creates friction. Friction slows down sales. You don't want any confusion. You don't want any friction. So be very clear when you say anything on the call.
01:26:39 - Seth Ellsworth
Cool. right.
01:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
definitely have to go. Let's keep working this out. Work on the two different offers and send over what you got when you got it.
01:26:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. Thank you much.
01:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. You're welcome. Good talk. Talk to you soon.
01:26:54 - Seth Ellsworth
Bye.

You ready for orange charts?
00:00:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sir.
00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's the week been?
00:00:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Pretty good. Good. Nothing. Nothing out ordinary. No, no drama. Just moon here disappearing. That's it.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't happen with his daughter.
00:00:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you there? I can't hear you. we're because I'm gonna switch to my laptop. How can I do this? I don't know if I can do this work. This is my fear.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you now.
00:01:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's weird. It's like my volume or something. So Eric's sort of freaking out about it. I do, you can freak out. But he is.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I don't know if you said something, but wasn't there something wrong with Mani or his daughter?
00:01:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. He's got like a six month old that's got some sort of viral something.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she had to see a RSB?
00:01:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No. But he lives in India. I can stick in India front with the best place. to music based on what I was checking. And cells in their last. Oh, something weird is happening in the zoom. What's this? That's weird. Something on zoom is like. Going in and out. I can see it on the screen, but I don't know what it is.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, something in zoom is going in and out.
00:02:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like something was turning green and then red.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But.
00:02:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't think I don't have. I mean, if I turn up the iPods. And you have to switch to laptop. Which I lose my big screen. How do I not have pulling in headphones here? Don't go. Cause I don't use for your headphones.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why. Well, uh, and it's a PC Mac, but like it's Bluetooth though.
00:03:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You should be able to pair AirPods with it. It is. They're just whatever's happening is happening. I don't know what's happening.
00:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, worst case scenario, you could call in and still share screen.
00:03:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Finally enough, that's what I was, that was my original plan. And then I was like, no, I'm going to, I'm going to try it. That's what you get for trying, Dan.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. trust the technology. I was playing around with. day period yesterday and um for either what do you call it have them or zoom i i set up two different ones oh i wasn't sure like you were hearing and dialing it anyway um my goal what i want to be to do is have it extract any of the comments from the transcripts that are mine and see if there's anything that's like is that a value or principle that i have right is that something that i was teaching or whatever so it can kind of put in my library of stuff yeah um so we'll see if it captures anything today what's the zap doing um so there's one that goes from fathom that's supposed to extract this transcript and but the fathom zaps weren't really in the So I honestly don't expect to do anything. Also, it wasn't really clear to me, and I'm not as a pure user, really. And then the zoom one, it went from a zoom transcript to, and I wasn't sure that I choose the right thing. It's like it has a built-in parser, but you don't see the parser. It just shows you the different things, but it's looking and acting like a parser. So I think that's what's happening. But anyway, so it goes from that and then dumps it into a Google Doc, the transcript into a Google Doc, and then you interact with chat TPT in that recipe and that's up and give it a message. And the message is, I want you to extract anything, you know, that's said by Tina Marie and, you know, store to my library. whatever that all the instructions that I wanted to do. So we'll see if it does anything. I imagine it's going to be several iterations and tweaking and probably some customer support, but if somebody else hasn't already thought of that and done that to be like, okay, let me build my library of my own content kind of thing. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's thought of it.
00:06:22 - Dan’s iPhone
I have a buddy that's well, Vans. Vans, I don't even know what the he's talking about. But he is like, you know, he's not trading crypto anymore because his buddy traded the account. So he went down the AI rabbit hole and he is building personal exactly what you're talking about. Like, it's you and AI is what he calls it. And he's he's built this thing where you feed the AI your stuff. And it becomes like an extension of you. So I was I turned him on. like, oh, it's like second brain. It's like, what's that? told him. Um, but he's like super duper into this now where he built one where like, I mean, might get this wrong, but he was saying like he's built one that like a preacher can use to help write his sermons, but you're constantly feeding it your stuff. And then you're asking it things from you, from you. Like you're asking new questions or something like, I don't know, but he says it works great. He's like super freaking jazzed on it.
00:07:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Yeah, I can't remember because, um, almost a year ago, there was one that I was starting and I created a Tina bar. even remember what it was now. I'm doing a search and I can't find a thing. I originally started it.
00:07:59 - Dan’s iPhone
It's crazy how much more there. is one. He built it himself. So he's he's building it like yeah, we're using chat using open AI 4.4 or four lower cases.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, whatever the hell it is. And probably Python because chat TBT can tell you how to do it and build it. They're not hard to build. No, yeah, I abandoned it in the first place because I'm like, I'm going to go build my own. And then I couldn't get one single file to be found. And it like for days that kept happening. I'm I'm not gonna tell me to spend days on this.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Totally. Eric and I were working on something for quick and flowing. We needed to do like a date reformat. I was trying to send it to Zapier. Reformat it and then bring it back in. But when you brought it back in to high level, like you couldn't you couldn't get it back into high level in a way that you could use it the way that we needed basically. Just it wasn't going to happen. So then we were like, he was like, oh, we could use the custom code function. They have this new custom code function that it's JavaScript only. And I go, okay, great. Just have chat GPT write the JavaScript. And he's like, I've never done that. so I don't know what his prompt was, but he gave it a prompt to write this date reformatter code. It spit out the code. Then he had to figure out how you present that code in this function inside of go high level, which took a couple tries, but then ultimately it worked. It was like, holy , dude. So now we can have chat GPT write this JavaScript whenever we need to use in this custom code block. And then right after that, He's they're complaining about how Munir blah blah blah blah blah like what are we gonna do and Somewhat jokingly, but not really I'm like Gutenberg blocks their JavaScript. I go. Why don't you just ask chat GPT, but that's how to make a Gutenberg block.
00:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you said and It does He's like, can I can I explore this?
00:10:28 - Dan’s iPhone
go absolutely like you so now if we have these finished blocks that need to be tweaked That seems a lot easier to do than just start Building blocks from scratch not having ever built a block, right? So you know Munir's experience is baked into these blocks, but he didn't invent the code He just knew his way around so I go.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guarantee you I was just gonna say I bet because we're the GPT for oh, um the token limits have increased exponentially. But you could probably dump as much of his code and you could dump multiple snippets. the limitations that used to be, you can only upload four or five files at a time. And the last time I uploaded eight at one time in one session, one comment. And, but you could like have it look at his code and say, you know, is there, do you anticipate any compatibility issues with your code in this code?
00:11:38 - Dan’s iPhone
Yep. Yeah, and it's like, and they, this one, and there's code, I think they want to borrow from one block and bring to another. So I'm like, if you have the code, then you can probably give it what the code and say, hey, this code does XYZ. I need to take that and put into this. So he was like. Oh my God. So that's why I'm like, Muneer's not really part of the team. Anyway, we can now, we wouldn't have been able to ride all these blocks on our own with Chad TBT, like it wouldn't be anywhere near as good, but now going forward, we can maintain that and extend them came over.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Which would be great. I still keep thinking about whatever Muneer's done. So I had one dollar almost die from RSV and it's really common.
00:12:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Six months is the age, the page.
00:12:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's usually between two months and two years, but it basically think of COVID, but for babies.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, yeah.
00:12:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what it is.
00:12:45 - Dan’s iPhone
He just didn't, he didn't indicate anything. was. But I will.
00:12:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It is. It's a new. age. I've been spending I don't even spend a lot. Okay, this is how weird it is. I was on the gym last night and normally I can't do my workout without like a particularly paced type of music. It has to be at a pace to keep my energy and my heart rate going or I just kind of start to fade. But I was talking to GPT. I was like banging out chapters and telling stories and stuff. It was just so weird. I was just watching myself. I'm like, I'm walking through the gym talking to a robot. It's just so weird. It's so weird.
00:13:43 - Dan’s iPhone
But it's awesome.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy. Okay, so here's one thing that I did. last night I was telling the story and I was talking about how it's crazy to me that a year ago I started lifting weights. And my primary thing at that point was just trying to heal my immobility, my mobility, but because I couldn't, I could barely move my shoulder. I had frozen shoulder, I had really bad tennis elbow. Glenn couldn't help me. I think because Glenn was bathing me too much because he's like, you're in a lot of pain and I just don't want to mess it up. Like he was scared and that wasn't helpful to me. But anyway, so I was telling it, I'm like, I started going to the gym and I was trying to heal something. And then what I've noticed is that within a few months, know, my I wasn't having that pain anymore. But then other pain I didn't even know I had was going away. Like I realized that I'm popping up and down the stairs, carrying, having things and my knees like feel great. But I didn't really, lies how bad they had been feeling going down the stairs and that I was I was bending my knees out when I would go down the stairs like I was changing how I walked because it was hurting and I'm like now it's a year later and some of my muscle groups are increased by 200% and others by 300% based on you know how much I can lift and how fluidly and whatever and but I really have only been going once maybe twice a week and sometimes some months it was only like there would be 11 day gaps between going or 16 day gap was the longest one when I was sick but I'm like even still like my body composition has changed completely I've lost inches and I don't have any pain anywhere ever even with fibromyalgia and it was just crazy but I was I was telling it I'm like this is an application for everything in life even business if you show up consistently everything improves. You don't even have to do it every single day. But if you if something is on your mind constantly and you keep applying yourself to it, there will be improvement. And there will be improvement you didn't anticipate happening. And so I was just like store this because I'm gonna I need to find a place to use it. And it's like, okay, let's put this into building a solid foundation chapter two. And I was like, what the. So it rewrote my chapter, inserting my story, and then pulling it out for the different sections that we had already written and finished. And that was really cool. Because GPT for like the one before this could not have done that.
00:16:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Right.
00:16:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those iterations are wild that this and but like we really only started using this about a year and a half ago. Right. Now look at what it's at. And the pace is only going to get faster because the learning models are feeding each other. We've got all these new engineers on it and new prompters plugging data into it, learning how to work with it. That pace is just going to go crazy. So in terms of like teams. Who we need to do what some things are just going to be not necessarily obsolete, but how they show up is going to need to be different. So people that were. Show up and I do this in my job kind of thing, right, that coast coasting is going to go away for most of these positions because people hiring them are going to be like at your pace, I could go get a robot to do that. Well, I need you to do is take what I can't do and be strategic and say, do this, that, the other thing, but anyway. It's eye-opening, what it can do.
00:18:06 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a brand new world, as they say.
00:18:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. it keeps being a brand new world. That's what's even crazier. like blink and it'll change. Okay. um, or start, um, kind of what do you call it? Like prompted by thinking about what to give us role in what he's doing. And even more after the conversation we just had. and also, like, so just to recap what I was talking about last week. Um, to look at where you're at, where you're going by the end of We're taking a look at it. Potentially. wanting to do something with Joe where you've got multiple people on it of a certain type. know, I just want to really look at what we're working with right now and just kind of get an update visual on where we're going. So anyway, you had it in like, it was a flow chart type thing. I feel like I can't remember what it was called. I know because I've used it for years, but I don't use it consistently.
00:19:39 - Dan’s iPhone
I said, your guess is as good as mine.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It wasn't like mine, Meister, but it was something like that, like, gliffy, gliffy.
00:19:48 - Dan’s iPhone
You either loose the chart or if you think it was gliffy. I know I used both at different points in my career.
00:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, oops, but I really do think it was goofy, because I don't really use listed charts, but it could have been, let me just search my fee.
00:20:12 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm just going to log in and see what's where.
00:20:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
00:20:29 - Dan’s iPhone
A little Losing chart, my dog is losing his mind because he wants a my daughter's Oh, he's searching dead.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm Ryan and Glippy. Oh accountability and org chart, but that was like 2018. And then Evan Mark Katz came up. Your buddy accountability and org chart. Glippy Google Drive. This is. I remember because it was an export and I can't see it and drive. It's very whatever needed to see it would be. Let's see what the log in. I overdid it at the gym last night. I'm my shoulder. It's hurting me. My neck, neck, shoulder.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm like, they're stuck and I'm like, what is this? I didn't make this.
00:22:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We had Stacy do the last arm chart now that I think about it.
00:22:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Nope. No, she didn't.
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Let me search Tumor for arm charts, see what we can find.
00:22:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No one to glippy. Yeah. Your account has expired.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, you know, I just got the same thing.
00:22:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't want to buy it. Where's the preversion glippy? Right. I don't know if there's anything in here. I don't want to buy. I don't want to That's all I know. All right. I haven't had what, I haven't had a Glyphia accounts 2019, I don't think Stacey was here.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:23:24 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, I think it's actually in Google. I think it's a Google, what you're going to say.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like a flowchart.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone
Whatever their thing, their slide thing.
00:23:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because we did have her do something. Okay, yeah, that sounds about right.
00:23:54 - Dan’s iPhone
doesn't seem like it's been that long. The one that you and I missed. Or that this is the last. What I mean, that is so grossly complicated. So this ain't it or if it is, it ain't.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you got?
00:24:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Let's see. Wait, hold on, looking at what other ones I have. And here's Bobby, did this one come for? Yeah, I mean, this doesn't even have Stacy on it. This was accurate at some point. This is what I thought it was going to be. It ain't this.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh. Let me see, like, let me open my assume more. No, going. Oh, yeah. Um. David, look, I forgot about him.
00:25:28 - Dan’s iPhone
He's still mad.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he?
00:25:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, yeah.
00:25:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he worked out of the office. He comes here, like, multiple days a week.
00:25:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I'll...
00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone
What does he do? He doesn't do anything to me. Oh. He just works out of here, I should say.
00:25:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He can't do He He doesn't have lunch sometimes, because I think, Brandon... Mm-hmm.
00:26:08 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, more when you own the building, that's what I'm in office space for years, like I've never ever charged him. He's been in the last two, right? I don't think he ever came to the one and he's a skate one or he never worked out there, he worked out a skateboard one, skate shop one. He's a little to do stuff. He's great. Don't need him yet.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's see. Can you share that so I can look at it without squinting? he's squinting. Yeah, zoom or email with.
00:27:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, there we go. Your share is free.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. yeah. Okay. Okay, where's the zoom in? Okay. Where's that? Seriously. It will not zoom. Okay. All right. Holly. Well, now, so this isn't labeled. Okay, that is basis. Oh, who's Holly?
00:27:59 - Dan’s iPhone
That was the. the role. So Holly was the person at the time, I was like, oh, was going to be somebody it would be her. That now became Stacy.
00:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's change that.
00:28:18 - Dan’s iPhone
But that sort of role still.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I she's more like, what would you call her?
00:28:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know that I'm not good at that. I don't I don't do titles. So I don't use them and I don't grant them.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's kind of my issue with org charts and like corporate style type organization for small businesses because I call it compartmentalized rules.
00:28:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I call her a side. Like, what if what does Stacy do? like, she's my sidekick. I don't know what that is.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would call it more like administrative supports because you being admin but like she helps in everything and it's generic but that's because she does so many different things.
00:29:20 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean she's yeah exactly it's like project management but it's not much because it is I don't know but I'm not going to get hung up on that because it's for nobody so right well if that's the case then do you not want to do this at all? No no I'm just saying so here it is I mean this is way less than this right it is so like you don't have anybody for sales it's you no it ain't me I don't even know sales like this I mean I'm not thinking about like you talking to Joe are you talking about anybody anybody that's
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
interested in working with you is because you've talked to them. So if sales exists, it's damn.
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone
I wouldn't even say it's a real role though, right?
00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like this, it's this temporary thing. Well, so like there's the difference between roles and function. And then there's the question, do we organize according to roles or function?
00:30:27 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't think it's function. In my version of the world, it's never going to exist. It existed here because we were going to start selling it to everybody. But in the version that I actually like, I don't want it to be associated with me at all. I mean, I think you could have it here and say, there's someone else wanted to do it, yeah, but I'm not even doing sales, right? me talking to Joe is like me partnering with Joe, right? Right part was the word that I was like, yeah, I had like partner relations Yeah, Joe's gonna sell it, but he's not selling basis really he's telling his his Partnership version of right his sort of Whatever right it's like he's not Really not like if it weren't a pot if someone came along and they weren't a podcaster I would never expect him to talk to them or deal with them at all right if a cold lead came in It's never going Joe.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if it would go to anybody I put it here partner relations today and yeah, I mean that's accurate so then Just get rid of sales Well, I mean part of me thinks I should That's a good idea Yeah How about you make a copy and you keep that and we work on this one
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm going to make a copy and work a couple.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I need the copy shared.
00:32:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Please. I know these people aren't. Maybe it's in a shared folder. Poop, poop, poop, poop.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got my new food service started and I love it but yesterday I was supposed to get a delivery and I got held up and I'm like, oh, I just put myself in a situation that I really don't like. I'm expecting something I want and I can't have it. I don't like that. But it has already been opening my eyes to like other options and things that can get that are clean that are at the grocery store that are pre made. Not a few but some brands that I didn't know about. But it's been really nice having variety and healthy food like there's like this cauliflower and we need to know about super good. My daughter's like, I almost. I up in my mouth. I liked it.
00:34:06 - Dan’s iPhone
What if I put my own on?
00:34:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, oh, there it is. There's the dog. Okay. Okay. in this one, we could either just disconnect sales or just get rid of it. But I think we should make it according to what we're doing now and just get rid of it. They can always be added back in.
00:34:31 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I'm gonna leave it because I have no idea how to edit this. So removing is easy. Like I don't want to know who made this.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess it was me. Yeah, I think we did it together because I remember this. Let's see. Define, join, change, rotate, ungroup. I'm gonna do this and then see if I can undo it.
00:34:58 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know if that wasn't it. Well, well, well, well, great thing is a nice show.
00:35:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I do.
00:35:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Can't hide.
00:35:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Just like. Oh, look what I did.
00:35:26 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. That works. like.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay, you don't exist right now.
00:35:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Is there any.
00:35:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can we drag over? But at least we know like we can tell just by that that it's not something we're doing right now. Okay, so David, all of that stuff. Same thing. Can we just get rid of that part?
00:36:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, no, I mean that there's some validity to that. I think what is the new represent so we have partners migration. Oh, new sites.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then maintenance, but David's not the dude.
00:36:18 - Dan’s iPhone
And there's no dude really.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would you not call that so like what happens is you tell Greg to go design something. I mean, so far there hasn't even been like a new new site, right?
00:36:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, probably would be with the podcasting building one right now, but it's not for basis. So has there been a new new site that is not JB? And then I mean the podcasting isn't everything. But it would go under partners though, right?
00:37:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think it would be new sites, but under partners.
00:37:13 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, there's things like literally yesterday was thinking, what if it's only ever that, right? So I'm like, I should position it to start as that it's the solution for podcasting, period. And then later on adding these other things if it ever comes to that. So it's like shouldn't the messaging be, hey, I know that we made this full podcast. That's all we do, even though it's not the plan, but that's the current plan. Maybe the current plan is the plan. So in that regard, then there's just production and no partners, there is maintenance. There.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. Open. you do this you're going to be doing something similar with mom right so it's not just podcasting like you have at least two legs on this no nothing none of that it's built on none of that gets built on basis oh okay yeah that's all it gets built on high level and bampoli which is a totally different org guard yeah which i need to make a note for that that we want to have a org chart for that for mom um okay well so the org chart should be based off of what we're doing now and what we're working on now and even you know with the conversation once now through the end of the year i don't see you going just knowing the pace that you work at unless something presents itself but even still it would only be in the beginning of like let's talk it out there mazes. So we can make this around podcasting. So there's the functionality of the current thing. So there's partners because you have, what's his face, binaural beats. Jodi, I can't say Cody, but I'm like, it's not Cody. Um, Jodi, and strong marriage now. Empire.
00:39:36 - Dan’s iPhone
No empires in that part.
00:39:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, Jodi and strong marriage now, then, and Wolfar, which probably is maybe going away, but.
00:39:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I mean, in that part, you know, my plan is, are there going to be any future partners? No. Right. So it's like, partners even goes away.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if this is that it doesn't because it's still like this like unless you're planning on getting rid of all those it still needs to be done right now they're just maintenance there there's you know I mean there's no stand alone so then you're just looking at like this yeah I still think that there should be something specified between in-house like I guess it's under development and this all should so production is it even production or is it under develops the dev ops the maintenance production Do you got an I in there? Is that not Avishak and Vijay in there too?
00:41:25 - Dan’s iPhone
It's really these guys.
00:41:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like I'm just going to call them repressed because so what is these guys these three Eric have a check oh oh you're not looking at zoom I'm looking at it in the actual document so when you said these guys I was like what are you talking about okay so that team right so they're like a like a team yeah um there no I can have it so
00:42:00 - Dan’s iPhone
But I said, I was like, this is your stuff. Bye.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You You don't have anybody for that?
00:43:15 - Dan’s iPhone
They don't currently exist, but like a future role, particularly.
00:43:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How future?
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone
So right now it's just Noriel, so I mean, I guess it's Noriel really right now. It depends, it depends, it depends if we need it. Right now we don't necessarily need them.
00:43:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why would you put that there and not the, you know, future or, you know, down the side at the bottom or something?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone
under Noreo. So I did like what Noreo and I discussed was all right you're what if we just move you to being the code over Lord therefore he would be over some level of larval developer but right now he's occupying that role so okay about hey if I reduce what I pay you and we bring in junior dev to do that that's that's where we're at so the person exists by the end of the year okay it can see me everything there should be no TBD like that should be separate let's not do that language okay sorry right so that role exists there we do have a larval dev so while I'm looking at underneath bobby um in the project management and you've got css pine and you don't even use pine grow anymore do you we're I'm still up here we gotta get our way down there
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay, okay. I'll calm myself.
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes, that doesn't even exist then Because the blocks right right Oh Yeah, I forgot about that CC. Right.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So like teach day You Okay.
00:46:31 - Dan’s iPhone
I know, I'm like, I can't even see those numbers.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where does give a fit in this? doesn't really, or doesn't do something. No.
00:46:47 - Dan’s iPhone
No. He's just like a floating. It would be like, he's like an upward person, right? They don't have a permanent. It's a if and when kind of thing. It's like I'm floating out, don't even know, like it's none of these.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is responsible for managing any like temporary contract tech people?
00:47:12 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he doesn't manage anybody.
00:47:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm asking you who me. Yeah.
00:47:22 - Dan’s iPhone
And they're, you know, are you not part of the dev ops team though, also? No. I have no idea what's going on there right now. Like illustrated earlier. So like I hear about it, but I'm not intimately involved. I'm hit right. I basically try to get into him and to him. To Noria or Eric. I don't really ever talk to Avish. I can DJ unless they ask me stuff directly, which happens here and there. Or Stacy will tell me they asked me something, which happens more frequently. the other? Did you answer their question? What question? They asked your question.
00:48:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay. Well, I just think like just the hiring and the giving the jobs and who does what you do that and it's not represented here.
00:48:25 - Dan’s iPhone
I think there's not even the same. Well, it's not because I hire people on a lark for like random that I do, right? when I hire somebody to do a straight, I mean it's whatever.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it kind of falls under ideas.
00:48:47 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, it's so infrequent. It's not frequent or there's no level of permanence to it. These that grow up permanent, although even
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's get down to production then.
00:49:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Who singing? This is. Traverse.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought somebody in the office was singing because I can't really like hear music. It sounded just like somebody in the background singing without music.
00:49:41 - Dan’s iPhone
There is the music. It's a lie about.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. And Eric takes over like any new projects, right, he's like in charge of them? No.
00:50:23 - Dan’s iPhone
No. Okay. So it's, I mean, again, this is where you'd say it's like the WordPress team, but it's not even, it's, that's the thing, right, I don't even know that there's really no dev in production. It's done over here and then given to production.
00:50:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so define the process. What happens when you're like, we need a new site, or we need to migrate site.
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone
whatever. It gets Stacy's sense of damage. That's it. Okay, so like Bobby doesn't know Eric doesn't get the introduction Stacy, not Bobby. Right, that's what I'm saying. Like Bobby's definitely not down here.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then would you not maybe just drag that up and then like take the lines over to WordPress instead of things underneath it.
00:51:48 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, so over here there this is where they do dev outside of like for product not as part of production like so let's say that these guys I'm trying to think of it like them doing this whole block thing like it has nothing to do with production.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's part of WordPress, so it's like production is just like, I get that, I get that, which is why I'm saying production is its own block, but it links to those people that already exist on the org chart rather than duplicating them on the org chart.
00:52:30 - Dan’s iPhone
But no, right? So yeah, mean it would go to these two guys, so you could definitely do that.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two guys are still serving the same overall skill set function in the business. It may be a different department that calls on them, but I think, so I always think in terms of simplest, right? Rather than have a whole bunch of blocks and positions and seats, whatever, sometimes we have, I mean, whatever, they are the WordPress people and they're, they're used for internal and, and other projects. I just, I just don't think that any name should be repeated more than once if we can find a way to organize the structure that really shows what it actually looks like and I don't know how else to explain it. I'm bringing us not doing that well, but I don't, I think that we should try to, I think the simplest format is one where one person's name only shows up once and everything that's attached to them is attached to them.
00:53:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's more accurate like we, it's a lean team. If we can, I think having the ability to visualize its simplicity, as it is, will help us as we're looking at growth, but also as you look at other projects that you're maybe influencing, or even just like, like David, you know, if you're having a conversation about how simple things are, and go like, look at this, this is my team. Look at everything that we do. You know, you've got another 71, which is a different org chart, it's a small, but it's still a small team, and it's still, you know, almost a $4 million.
00:54:44 - Dan’s iPhone
Is it? don't know where it's at Okay.
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you know that that's and how you know how many of them are actually full-time Or work full-time Work full-time None Yeah, so Probably. Yeah Anyway, just that's the thing is And the other thing is when it starts to get too big and too complicated is when implosion happens and that's relative Impertinent and important information for somebody like David because he tends to Just go to horizontal And David who go ahead and I'm just saying you have a habit, like people ask you for advice and sometimes that leads to new partnerships, but either way, if you have a visual way to represent how simple your step is, number one, I think we've run it better, I think you are better, you know, help other people that you just, you just do it anyway, but now you've got a visual tool. Well, I don't think we have enough visual representations. I don't think there's enough documented for any of our stuff, and especially in its simplest form, and I think that that's something that I think it's a lever that's been neglected and definitely because I haven't been helping it the way I should. Wow, you are first key today. Remember that the commercial for Frisky food for the cats, they were just pouncing on everything. I'm like playing with balls. That was the assignment today, Dan. But please put Greg in design because it's driving me next that it's TBD this long.
00:57:42 - Dan’s iPhone
I already did that.
00:57:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:57:45 - Dan’s iPhone
It was because he was in a different block. No, I just moved this block.
00:57:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't see Greg show up.
00:57:53 - Dan’s iPhone
There we go. I mean, here's the thing, right? It's like, do you even separate production? I mean, I guess we could do. Oh, I gotta go backwards now. I can use myself.
00:58:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's worth the effort. I can almost guarantee them. Can't, because it may not be this way, but you going through this, you'll just be driving along and have another epiphany because you saw something that you didn't really notice, you saw. Every time we do a visual exercise, something comes out of it that wasn't anticipated.
00:58:50 - Dan’s iPhone
That's pretty, this is pretty much it. Because Greg Design exists outside of production, technically. sometimes he designs stuff. that has nothing to do with production, right? it'll be doing logo, it has nothing to do with the thing being built. So like, I think you're still producing it. Yeah, but it never touches these guys, never touch it. They never see it as nothing to do with anything down there. So it's like, before me or like, so right now he's doing a graphic for fan flowy, right? Which is, I mean, that's not even on here, right? Well, it is the site's being decided and well, it's just four. It's like part of would you put it under maintenance? No.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if it's just straight under production, it's under production. It would stay to not send Greg information?
01:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone
No, it goes straight from you every time. Like 99% of the time.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still think it's under production of some sort. It doesn't, I don't think it goes straight under operations. Or you change it to, it's not production, it's a website or something or website specific production that Stacey is over.
01:00:52 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, that we don't design is not just websites, right? I know that's what I'm saying.
01:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Is that website? Site production is one thing and design is another thing and design goes under, you know, like it's attached with like finance, DevOps, legal, all that, it's its own department and then website production is its own department and design gets linked the same way that WordPress would get linked under website production and DevOps.
01:01:30 - Dan’s iPhone
It's to, it's a trick, to make an elbow. It sounds familiar but I'm not getting a visual.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's a wait.
01:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone
Wasn't an epic?
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think it was an epic. Anyway, there's one of these, uh, it's either that or Arthur and the Visibles, but I think it was an epic. And there's this dad that gets, his daughter gets shrunk down. And so he's giant and he's hurts his elbow and like he says it like really slow, but she's tiny and he's huge and my kids for years and years and years, is randomly will just, if somebody says elbow, at least just like reenact that whole thing.
01:02:39 - Dan’s iPhone
It's a thing getting bigger.
01:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, your, um, chart? Yeah, because I think it's, it's fixed and maybe you have to like zoom out. But just drag it, drag those things up.
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Did you do that?
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I did that. The lines didn't follow. If I try to drag the bottom ones down. Oh, I know. Like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah.
01:03:53 - Dan’s iPhone
I think Greg disappeared again. And and What if you put
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I'm thinking about like production being to the right of DevOps and then that is Stacey.
01:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone
DevOps, they're developing like, for instance, basis itself. No, if they're developing something for fan flowy, if they're developing something for perfect wedding timeline, like those things have nothing to do with WordPress. Like Stacey has not worked on perfect wedding timeline ever.
01:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what I'm talking about. So I got to get through all of this to see what I'm talking about. But goes straight underneath you as the visionary and under, I mean, they're Stacey anyway, as liaison, which I don't think, I mean, don't know if she's like, maybe they're co integrators.
01:06:18 - Dan’s iPhone
He doesn't ever, she doesn't do anything with like rocks or running the meetings or like he does all that stuff. I mean, the liaison thing isn't even going to exist anymore because if I get rid of all these partners, that's like, who's there to leave his with?
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Get rid of all these partners. So like, are you not going to do strong marriage now and vinyl beats and all that stuff?
01:06:45 - Dan’s iPhone
So there's no one to talk to a strong marriage now. There's no one to talk to with vinyl beats. Like in my version of the world, like I just pay those people. Like, I don't talk to the strong marriage now people in years.
01:06:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you pay them?
01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone
their rip So they get their rip their their profit share But I don't talk to them.
01:07:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh You pay them because the money comes into your account, and then they get their their portion.
01:07:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah Look So that's The partner thing is old right Glenn's gone wolf or like That's I think that's gonna be gone Does Bobby give Stacy instruction about how to do her job and what to do On a regular basis now More often than not No So so this is my thing is I don't think we're pretty like do we prioritize the hierarchy of Tasks or people
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people. And I think it should be tasks or people because it's an accountability chart.
01:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that and that's where my brain has been going with this is who's accountable to who for what. But primarily, first it's who's accountable to who for what is secondary.
01:08:27 - Dan’s iPhone
So you forget it, but you have to separate the people from the role, right? Ultimately, the integrator like these people are accountable to the integrator before me, right? like Bobing talks to Abhishek and BJ once a week. I've never spoken to that and literally I've never spoken. So they're being accountable to the integrator.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's making sure that she doesn't talk to them to know. Is Stacy accountable to Bobby?
01:09:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Me, she is, but they don't really communicate very well.
01:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But is she accountable to him and he not accountable to her?
01:09:12 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay then. So I'm thinking that Stacy's line is on the same line as finance operations legal and DevOps.
01:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Which, but what line is that? What is that role?
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so, okay, so the role in the people, this is my issue with these systems, is that you have to choose what matters most because sometimes they don't agree with each other and they don't reconcile. And I think that it's more important that it be the people and the accountability in world. then the seat first in a very small team what I'm you're saying this block up here this thing yes I'm saying that doesn't exist okay then get rid of that yeah I don't think that exists okay so then the next thing is um I think production is on the same line also as finance as operations legal dev ops I don't think operations exist I mean look at it the only thing attached to it is production so then just put that into production move Stacey there and get rid of the operations block right because these are the same yeah yeah I mean that's as it exists right now I'm trying to hold on be still one tick actually I gotta run to the back.
01:11:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay, I play with this then Okay, I'm ahead look You I'm just go I can of I'm go ahead and see if I can Hi.
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it. I did not break it.
01:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh. I'm dead. Now it's ruined.
01:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not ruined.
01:13:10 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes.
01:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, what I'm wondering is. Okay. So production is websites. There's nothing else right.
01:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone
So is that not redundant? Um, well, the problem is. Design is not a website, right? So design has to go down there. Design is not always websites.
01:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. um, what I'm saying is like there's production and then design comes off of that and then new maintenance, whatever. I don't think we need to have a thing that says websites because that's what it is. Period.
01:13:50 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, but new and maintenance. Well, new and maintenance are new website maintenance website, but I'm just saying the block website goes away. Right. Right. Right. I'm going to it, technically.
01:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, new site. Right. And then what I would, I would want to see is like a line. Well, he's not a fan, nevermind. And do what I did. Okay. Does Norio ever use Abhishek and Vijay? Does Eric use them under DevOps?
01:15:15 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean occasionally.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and also so under maintenance site, would you put Eric there?
01:15:28 - Dan’s iPhone
No, he pretty much never does.
01:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And new sites like who does that?
01:15:37 - Dan’s iPhone
So primarily that gets issued to Abhishek and then Vijay. Those two are like one guy. It's like they're like a duo. I don't even know who does what. I just know Abhishek's more of the PM of their thing, right? Abhishek's very organized. Yeah, yeah, I think they have. I mean, the other thing is you could get rid of Abhishek and Vijay and just call them one thing. Yes. Whatever their company is, the camera and the name of it. Yeah. You could do that because I think they also have a guy that we never interacted, but that they take the work done too.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that's the thing to do. New site and maintenance site gets to be their agency, whatever it is, and we can put like a little note off to the side that agency is defined by Abhishek, Vijay plus whoever.
01:16:40 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. So then I mean, yeah, can't put it over under here because Stacy never taught us the story of it. No more.
01:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a spot for Munir on here or is he just like?
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone
He's just temporary.
01:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Consider like in the idea realm because you talk to him and that's not a permanent situation.
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone
You like yeah he's just temporary it's like it's a it's not permanent and it'll never be.
01:17:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, what's the difference between new site maintenance and word press development?
01:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone
Level of development. Or Eric is?
01:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Right now where you're at. In the production.
01:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone
Like. Yeah, it doesn't really exist.
01:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm thinking.
01:18:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Not here. Yeah. Yeah, now you're just like.
01:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you can't remember that company name, which
01:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone
If you just go ab slash beach. Well, we literally call them and there you go.
01:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that works.
01:19:19 - Dan’s iPhone
Work. Scrap. Ah, what is it doing? Pretty great. Oh, come on. You
01:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How and why did the yeah, okay OK, I was like, where does this come from? All right, this seems more accurate for what we have, and also what we'll need going forward, even with podcasting and stuff like that. Like, I'm just thinking of my mind. Do we have kind of a side chart over here of what goes under what, like, what in terms of, like, the maintenance? So we just kind of have a list for an example of, like, maybe a reference point. In my mind, I'm just thinking, like, what's the list of the maintenance projects? Like the paths or? No, no, and this wouldn't be part of the accountability chart, but it's kind of my, like, the next step. And how have we already been here now? for half, but okay. Anyway, it went fast for me. But this is good. But what I would want to do, so the next step to me of the conversation, not to me, this is accomplished, and I think it's good. But the next conversation I would want to have is, okay, what are we working on right now? are those stages? kind of plotting out where you want to go for the rest of fluid in terms of the conversations with Joe, like I think it's a very fluid pace, a loose pace. But I do think that there's some identifiable potential targets, emphasis on potential, right, because there's no contract, there's no anything. But I think that our experience, especially with people like Joe, meaning Joe is a one that is more guided than guided. thing. And if there's something to be done, you're the one or, or, but what he's got Heather, though, you know, that, that puts the framework and the outline of what is going to happen up. And I think that that's a conversation to be had and something to be working on for the rest of the year. In terms of like, what is the evolution of basis? That seems to be where the conversation goes most. Come in. Hold on one sec. Okay. Like we're wrapping up right now. Just a couple minutes. Okay. So that's where I would like to be talking about things and discussing next week and just kind of at where is basis going. Again, you know, there is a pace and a rhythm to it, which is pretty relaxed. But for it to get potential and to be able to keep traction in the best way that it can without being forceful and rigid, I think that's the conversation to have is to just kind of break down, okay, what could be happening, what are we going to be working on moving in specifics in terms of a project with Joe or anything else?
01:24:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, got to.
01:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This looks crazy different. you should go do a before and after like all the blocks we had.
01:24:42 - Dan’s iPhone
There go.
01:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, yes. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, 10, 11, 12 blocks compared to one account. That's at least cut in half.
01:24:53 - Dan’s iPhone
But I feel like it's cut by like 65 way more.
01:25:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's good. That's good. All right, well, my brain wants to go ask a bunch of other questions, but my mom do these any minute.
01:25:13 - Dan’s iPhone
So my next meeting is going to walk in the door.
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, then I release you.
01:25:20 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, they're texting me right now. I'm like, I'm not going to answer this text.

Okay, hello. Ah, this visible table for, we're just setting for this. Oh, did I, and I'm going to invite you? That's what I was trying to do, share in Maria. There we go, share. So logging to Trello and yeah, yep, yep, yep.
00:00:27 - Maria Gudelis
And then we can start setting up.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you had a something that you put, okay, so here, okay, um, well, we already have the business HQ. So, and not like all of our rocks, but we can create things that are specific to that project there, or we can just create a board in here. That's about that. We'll see how it goes. The systems and the teams have to be matched up, so it always just kind of depends on.
00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis
what we have a home to start with so let's let's be in the business HQ and you're okay I'm in that now business HQ yeah yeah you see how I added the graphic yeah I was like she'd be proud of me as I first trailer post I yeah I replied yeah yeah yeah you did yes tagged you in it I love that one here let's discuss tomorrow whoo-hoo hey how come I didn't see that notification should have got an email and also Trello does have an app for mobile yeah I do see that oh you use Trello on your mobile device I yeah because I don't get a lot of stuff with notifications I don't let things happen but if it's work-related I want to know time sensitive stuff yeah I got okay
00:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so your kind of driving things with the having created this new offer and it having things so it would probably be better to figure out what you want to do, where you want to go and lend support to that rather than we basically are shifting gears. So, we've got to figure out what's happening now. So, you have a master class that you're doing Saturday?
00:02:36 - Maria Gudelis
Yep, yeah, to Saturday, yeah.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A board? No, that's not what Read the board. The board title. in the workspace, you know, it's a part that I want to create, a list, hold on, table, I don't use this very often, so I'm having to, like, work for setting workspace views, table calendar, I don't want to do that, go back. Oh, add a card, how do I just create a new list, copy list, move list, archive list, is there, like, a list limit? Let just do that. this. Well, I'll just do this. Um, I duplicate it? I card. No, no, I don't see where I can just add a new list.
00:04:18 - Maria Gudelis
Each of these things are called lists.
00:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm, copy list now. Okay, I've got that. So now I'm just going to Okay. Okay. And So, Big Rocks, we need to change this on a screen share.
00:05:04 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, great.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Big Rocks, one, three high level done for you done with your clients, hybrid coaching group, DIY coaching. I mean, we could just change this could be the same, but this could be YouTube, but how, how are you envisioning the work that we're doing moving forward? So one of the things that I see as a potential is, so you said, let's just add this as a separate rock building, not this product, but I don't know how much time it takes to build, manage, and support the project, the product. Um, YouTube as a strategy. e to be able to drive traffic to if we were going to, the hybrid coaching group was about marketing and business all together, right? So business growth through, so there's the marketing and sales, but then there's also the systems and the teams and we were merging.
00:06:17 - Maria Gudelis
So would the buyers of the YouTube stuff then be natural? Yes, essential clients for that then?
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah, they would. And the other way around as well. Yeah. So they work really well together and either of them could be first, but you're already talking to people about YouTube every day, so kind of. The biggest thing is I'm concerned, I want to make sure that we stay focused on whatever that we're doing because it was small ticket offers and if it's like, if you get excited about something new or you can spend a lot of time doing that, like,
00:07:00 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, because I will get distracted and that will frustrate me and I'll probably have to disengage completely. Got it. Got it. Got it.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does serve everything. So, and you're excited about it.
00:07:14 - Maria Gudelis
And that's really important.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like there was a lot of just burnt out by the response that you were getting from people that really wanting. Like, like your low ticket, not just that low ticket as a strategy that you're teaching, they were, you know, like Joe and other people wanting you for basement prices.
00:07:37 - Maria Gudelis
Well, totally like this other guy right now is like, like one guy was like, how much are your ads and like if you wanted me to do ads for low ticket and I was like 2500 plus 10% which is I think extremely fair.
00:07:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he's like, well, I know another guy is willing to do for 1500 plus 10%. But I'm pretty standard right now, even for some of the biggest players.
00:07:59 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Oh, then let them hire them, honestly, because that, you know, yeah.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, because it's like, yeah, exactly.
00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, yeah, because like then that person probably 1500 is not doing anything about the offer or anything else is just pure ads. but yeah, I don't want the either or hell, yeah, for you or not. Whereas the real estate guy, you know, he didn't blink at the five K a month and then he seems really happy and had a good meeting with me the day. So, you know, probably having two more clients like him because they're going to need both our services to scale, you know. So I think what happened is you're right. I probably got burned out by all that. I saw a quick success with YouTube. I see YouTube as a superstructure for a low ticket offer or like our mid ticket offer that could scale. I think that's where that came from.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I think there's more to than that. I think that I think you're extroverted in my opinion. I could be wrong about that. But think that you draw energy from other people. But likewise, they draw energy from you. And I mean, you put a woohoo and everything and people need that.
00:09:19 - Maria Gudelis
There's a lot that you bring to it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that it's around not just marketing, but a marketing channel where you get to connect with people in a full personality, but also video so much more leverage because of the way that you can connect. It used to be that it was harder to fake, but now with AI, and really dumb people who can't tell the difference. But pretty soon, AI is probably going to be difficult to detect for almost all of us. The biggest thing that it will have a hard time replicating will be very outgoing personalities. it can't even come close to replicating me right now. I'm sure that it cannot come close to replicating you right now. But anyway, so what I think that it does is it allows you a reset or whatever audience that you have to, you know, they can either form new opinions or they can just go away because you're getting a whole new set of audience and eyeballs, which is good. I think you do that. like I said, it so I told you before, one of my strategies is I like to do one thing that serves multiple purposes. So YouTube, we just talked about let you socialize and engage regularly at a at a kind of high level, especially if one of the challenges that you do is like do a video challenge. There are so many people who make videos on a daily basis that have huge TikTok followers and things like that, because I did a video challenge like 11. ago. I don't make videos. They make videos all the time. were so shy, they were so reserved, and now they use video as their main, um, image, their, their main traffic source. And because I did a video challenge, and I, I love that. But one of the things you can do too is ask people like, um, ask a question, but have them respond in video. So you're, you're pulling people out. Anyway, one thing that does multiple things, it lets you engage with people.
00:11:27 - Maria Gudelis
It resets and merges your audience.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We need, no matter what offer we're doing, low cost, highly targeted leads. Exactly. It also gives us a complimentary offer. If we did the whole, you know, business growth strategy, which we may not want to do, you may just want to focus on this. And then we use, um, you know, business and systems to make their YouTube strategy and their business better. Right. So, of just the whole marketing in general. Yeah, when that we do do YouTube traffic strategies. And if you want to upgrade to higher level coaching, we'll also offer you systems and team support, because the more that you grow, the more support you're going to need. So there's all kinds of ways that that it can work out.
00:12:22 - Maria Gudelis
We just need to make a plan and stick to it.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keeping in mind that there's always evolution. Like there's room forever, but the big rocks, which is the point of the big rocks is they don't they don't really change. Everything that is done supports that. But we're still kind of new in this. And so it makes perfect sense. And like I said, I really do think that you need the purge and the reset very much. Yeah. Like you said, it is very leverage. You've been doing it based off of numbers, looking at the statistics. It's converting to sales. It's not Hey, I'm having fun, shiny object, getting leads and followers, but they're not actually converting to money. And I'd be concerned about it. But it's making sales just something that we just had kind of fizzled out, right? For well?
00:13:18 - Maria Gudelis
Oh, no, I just never used YouTube for years.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you driving traffic to right now is making sales. Like you were, you said it, it's made you money. Yeah, into selling.
00:13:31 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, a couple of things. So in the description, I have a few links. One is a link just to buy $500 one hour consult with me go straight to a counseling link. And to go about that, I was like, Holy , like, like, like, like, awesome, like, you know, from watching the videos, uh, and then I also haven't gone to the school group. And the school group now is five bucks a month or $25, um, paid for the annual year. people are buying that, like, whether it be one or two or three. today. Like I'm like, wow. Um, and then I have resell rights is something else that's $900.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's called, well, it's that digital growth community member, Michelle O'Neill stuff.
00:14:10 - Maria Gudelis
And so I sent them to a, um, I credit myself 100 free digital offers leave magnet. And once they get that, then it leaves them, Hey, if you're a really beginner at this, this is a fantastic program to join. It gives you resell to a whole funnel. Sorry.
00:14:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. My brain. I just, I needed to wait. It wanted to come out. So in my brain, my brain had thought my mouse should have kept it shut for a minute. But YouTube profits for offer owners and affiliates. Yes.
00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's also very specific.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't, I'm gonna go google that right now and see what comes up. YouTube profits for offer. One second. Well, first of all, there's no Google suggests. You see this?
00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I go to this, YouTube profits for offer, so owners and affiliates.
00:15:16 - Maria Gudelis
Was that a good thing or bad? You said there was no suggests.
00:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, well, so there's no, there's no competition for that particular keyword. But if we do YouTube profits, that should be a very broad keyword with how we not see how many pages it is like we used to be able to.
00:15:41 - Maria Gudelis
Oh, yeah. don't know. I wonder if it'll show up on my Google because on Canada, it'll be different. But you just Google YouTube profits.
00:15:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There it is. hundred. It's just the most covered.
00:15:51 - Maria Gudelis
A hundred and eighty-four million results.
00:15:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, of course, creative. We'll say we'll see what happens for a course.
00:16:00 - Maria Gudelis
There's a lot of them coming up here, isn't it?
00:16:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not giving me results again. tools. Oh, there it is. 23,600,000 and for course creators and coaches, we'll say I have to quit tools. Now we're 20 million. How these course creators build profitable businesses. So I'm going make online as a content creator or coach. Let's see. She's quite, not talking to you. So she's got 529,000 subscribers and this has 14,000 views. 41 comments, 703 likes. And it's on YouTube, but it doesn't necessarily say it's about using YouTube to do that. Okay, this is a year ago. YouTube is one quiet. YouTube will start paying creators for course content in 2024. 622,000, 13,000 views, 865 upvotes. Anyway, that particular keyword, I think, it's long tail, but I think it would be really good. And for the domain, it could be IT profits or creators and affiliates or, I don't know, or YT affiliate profits or something like that. I don't know, we'd have to play around chat. TPT is really good about coming up with some descriptions for that. You could also have two domains, right? So you could have the long tell keyword domain. And it's one that you actually do the drive the traffic to. Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. That makes sense.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you don't have Google likes than keywords. And then if everything on the page is relative, and actually, you know, not keyword stuffed, but it's really like, this is exactly how it works. And it's logical flow and things like that. So, um, what time is it? Okay. So big rocks. Um, let's just pretend that we're having a brand new conversation from scratch about what we want to accomplish between now through the end of January, knowing that right now you've got a client engaged. Yeah. Um, and so do we want to have something strategically where you're So putting out and maybe it's once a week or something like this about, hey, just a reminder, we've got this offer going, we're looking for a couple of people, whatever, and see if we attract people or we just ascend them through whatever's happening through the YouTube stuff. That's possible too. just let nature take its course in terms of whether or not we get a higher ticket client that can help fund everything while we build something smaller out.
00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis
Maybe, maybe not do that, like let nature take its course on naturally some people might come to us for a bigger funnel build, but maybe more for weeks I would then kind of get back on social media or we could put something together for that only because, you know, I did advertise, hey, only taking one client, right?
00:19:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I took him, I did say to him, hey, I was being for real, are you going to, you know, pay the rest of this because as I do. I'm on board.
00:20:02 - Maria Gudelis
That's all you need say. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So he'll make more sense if it's four weeks later than I advertised for another quarter. If I were to do it now, it would make, yes.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now we're looking, I mean, because it's end of October, so we could look at not starting that until December or end of November prepping into December. What makes sense to you there?
00:20:23 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, I think end of November prepping for December. Yeah, and like the original thing be what we talked about where we're sending them to like a video sales letter that you and I are on and we walk them through the framework, what they're going to get, we'll make it very clear, and then hey, if you want this book a call for us and we make them pay 100 bucks for the call so we don't waste time.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that really only gives us like two or three weeks to create something like that if we're targeting mid November, or we said end of November, end of November. Okay, so that gives us a few weeks to VSL, Maria and Tina, COOO, COO, CMO offer. Okay. Do we want to change this?
00:21:23 - Maria Gudelis
Get rid of it. Hybrid coaching group. If we were to do that, you think that's more like for first quarter 2025?
00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would probably be better timing. Yeah, so we'll see. And then this as well, because it's basically just a lower version, and that will kind of create itself from that, be siphoned off of the higher one, so Q1. So then we're going to bump those two down. So, what, what. do you want to put here? Like, you're already doing a masterclass. If you are going to plan out what you'd like to do through, let's say mid-January, right? Because whatever you're doing, there should be some kind of climax that piques about new year goals, right? So you don't and it's going to last through the first week to three weeks of January. So let's say through the first month of Q1, you've been imagining what that looks like or just kind of talking about it and doing it rather than making a plan.
00:23:50 - Maria Gudelis
Talking about it and doing it. I'll be right back just getting the dog is going. Hold on second.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep trying. Okay.
00:24:12 - Maria Gudelis
I mean, the general idea honestly was just like, yeah, let's just get this done taught, put together of course, sell via on-demand webinar for 197 or that's sort of what the process was, but you mean like talking to other people about new year stuff like that or what do you mean or just no, no, I mean, whatever we're selling, there is going to be a new year correlation that helps us make you've got Black Friday offers. I would imagine you also do a new year offers. Yeah, yeah, usually you speak group coaching, yeah, yeah.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so sell course via webinar.
00:25:04 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, I have to put a pencil on that, like whether it's like that via just a standalone webinar or whether I'm like a low ticket funnel or whether there's a $7 thing and the thing that I'm creating now like this Saturday and next week becomes like the upsell one for $197 to a $7 offer.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me I'll add again real quick.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Yeah. So the two options are, so of course, one by seven via webinar or sell a low ticket funnel. You have any specificity to put here? Yeah, we're $7 that go is front end.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's go F E.
00:25:48 - Maria Gudelis
then OTO one is $197.
00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what the $7 version is?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis
No, it could just simply be 101 templates, like video hooks, templates. Yeah.
00:26:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what's this?
00:26:18 - Maria Gudelis
The OTO one is this thing we're creating the, it was the YouTube fast track or launchpad, but yeah, the YouTube profits. Oh, like it, because we changed the name profits for affiliates. Offer owners and affiliates.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. um, basically, it is. Laying. research? If you could bullet point the things in your process, what would it be?
00:27:13 - Maria Gudelis
So I know the research, I know maybe taking notes, maybe the scripts, like what are some of the... Yeah, yeah, so the research and then the planning, the content, yeah, the script per video, I don't necessarily do a full script, like word for word, but the outline for the video, and then the next thing would be the recording of the video, including the script for the video, that includes the tags, the title.
00:27:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna make that separate. Because that's its own strategy Okay Don't you think like so you write the content and maybe it's Research and then maybe it's tags. What did you see tags and titles?
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, and then content planning should be around the tags and title because you're research because those are the things right that get you Yeah, you're right people matched Like the video packaging if you want to call that is yeah, you're you're you're thumbnail The subject like the title of the video and I would say tags as well. Yeah, that the video packaging cuz yeah Tells you goes out YouTube's algorithm What it's about and gets you found in the traffic and what you say in the video If you know some of those keywords if you say that in the video that helps too if you go to I'll put up another tab and go to fast digital wealth.com forward slash yt I have a graphic in there that Shows five phases phases. was intending to kind of just use as a framework to teach the masterclass And again, it's not stuck in stone, you know, because I kind of do these things just to get it going Try um, h to do p s w w w I can shove the link in it already is Maybe it's not h tps Fastest a little Anyway, copy. I'll put it in the chat here.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said dot com right?
00:29:32 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, it's in the chat there I think I think I have to fix the domain to have it allow the it without the www. think that's just a minor tech issue Okay So if you scroll all way down, there's a graphic that shows five There there's a little further up Yeah, everything with the white like, go, yeah, there, one more, phase one, phase two, phase three. If you scroll a little bit up, you'll see the title, there you go. So, funness analysis, which is, and then record.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this in that. Hello. What do you want to call this? Was that what to call it? So, I'll put this here, oh my gosh, good.
00:30:56 - Maria Gudelis
Okay. you.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Okay, and how many people are signed up to your master class?
00:34:19 - Maria Gudelis
I think I've got definitely 10, let me see if there's been more, let me just sign in and look. And like the Friday will be the deadline, so I probably will get more on Thursday Friday. Let's go sales models.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One thing to consider is that if your offer is about eyeballs and traffic and you have a low attendance on a webinar, that might sound, that might, I don't know, because you're just promoting that webinar to Facebook, right?
00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis
10. I think it's 10. Yeah, I think it's exactly. Sorry, I was trying to answer your first question about how many. So, uh, I think one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, I think it's exactly 10. I think I'm next. Look, 11, 12, 14, 15. Is that me? Is that me? my voice.
00:35:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I keep forgetting.
00:35:31 - Maria Gudelis
don't know. Or if you're just giving me your PayPal email, I'll just pay you.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not at proffereddriversink.com.
00:35:38 - Maria Gudelis
There you go. email for everything. Okay, okay. I'll send it that way.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Be profit drivers, girl.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're awesome. Um, so that's just the thing is, but, so, but were you only promoting that master class to Facebook? You weren't promoting that on YouTube, were you?
00:35:59 - Maria Gudelis
No, It's to cool traffic.
00:36:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that sales page sucks.
00:36:03 - Maria Gudelis
Okay, that's what I wanted to get that.
00:36:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the only thing I was going is like, if you're talking about, Hey, I get lots of traffic from YouTube, and then you don't have a lot of attendance on the webinar, that would be that would seem like weird. But if it's like, Hey, you guys have been following on Facebook and I just wanted to show you what I'm doing. And it gets some sales. But like, clearly, I've only been doing it a little while. And they know that.
00:36:25 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, it's something why people know me that I always do a cheap masterclass before launching a bigger course, like in like five years ago, I did the same strategy for selling a course about how to do challenges. So hey, you want me to do workshop on how to do challenges? And I did 97, I sold 30 of them. And then after that, that $97 product masterclass evolved into a $500.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a thought. And I'm going to say it. And sometimes things come out sounding rude. And I don't mean it to be, but I just had a thought.
00:36:58 - Maria Gudelis
So I'm not going to filter.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It thinking about branding because you said this is what triggered it for me is that you said that people know that you'll put out a masterclass in the beginning.
00:37:10 - Maria Gudelis
I think what also people know is you bounce around from different things from time to time. That is true. Yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's what I'm thinking about is like depending on who you want to attract, right? the jack of all trades might attract the jack of all trades. There's a difference in in in value perception between a generalist and a jack of all trades. They're the same except for a generalist has a strategy about knowing all the things and they'll still generally put it toward a specific type of thing. So I'm very much a generalist but my my expertise is using that general knowledge towards optimized business growth, optimize sustainable business growth in a joyful business. You know what I mean? Yeah. So that is that is a general view. That is not a general skill. There's so many different things involved in that. So I can be talking about AI, but I'm going to be talking about AI in the realm of growing business strategically leveraged, optimized, sustainable, joyful. Make sense? Yep. So if people hire level people that are want to spend a lot of money that would spend a lot of money, see you as a person who can't possibly be an expert because you're jumping around to all the different things, never really staying and putting in 10,000 hours, you know, per se, whatever's in their brain.
00:38:50 - Maria Gudelis
This is not my judgment, right? But this is that area.
00:38:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So maybe we consider changing the branding and putting out the language. of hey you guys have seen me be doing you know this thing that thing because one thing that I am is I'm always a student I'm always a teacher I'm always a marketer and in that vein I've done these things in the past but really I'm an expert marketer and it helps you know to state who you are how are they going to know if you don't tell them yeah and and that goes back to the pedigree and the authority post of this is what I've done what you see is what I get excited about because this is social media and I'm being social talking about these things yeah what you don't know is I've done this and this and this and this and clearly this is what I'm focused on and I'm working with you know another systems at like another business growth expert who focuses primarily on systems and teams but is also amazing at market. marketing and that kind of thing so but but I think that you should always think about what are people thinking when they're looking at you and what are your the people that you you're like your ideal clients the ones that would pay the most the ones that you learn the most from the ones that you want to maybe do profit sharing with what are they thinking when they see what you're putting out there just something to think about and if it matters so to me it's a long-term leverage play to always know like what are other the high leverage people thinking when they see it yeah I also am I don't care who thinks what I'm just gonna be me and you know teach and do whatever but I do but there's wisdom that I've learned in considering those things because I have the best opportunity to serve my people when when I'm leveraged, when I'm making good money, when I'm working with very smart, high level people. So I need to make sure that they're aware that I'm out there and that they know what I'm capable of. So those opportunities come so that I keep sharpening my saw and up leveling, you know what I mean? they need to know that I'm out there and what I'm so anyway just something to think about is like who there's an audience that you serve and there's the uh not the stalkers but what are they the the lurkers. The lurkers are the high dollar payers that never say anything but DM you and say hey look I've seen you. I've been like I've got money you know I mean? They they operate very differently but I but I I want you to always think about what are the lurkers thinking when they want to.
00:42:03 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, hi dollar lurkers. Got it. Yeah, even Alan's text of the other day. Well, you know, marketing, Maria, like, you know, it's like, yeah, I think just saying marketing expert maybe is is the maybe the brand name, which is very good also the marketing expert or something.
00:42:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. Yeah. And and and and that you can be like, I like to play in the different channels. You know, I like to, I like to play with the different, um, I don't know what you would call it. It's not the channel, but the like a VSL versus a landing page versus email. Like that's not really, maybe that's a channel. Not a platform. I third, I don't know. Channels and methods.
00:42:52 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a firm believer in that. Like it doesn't doesn't assign me. I know. think you're a firm believer.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to any of these methods work, whether it's low ticket or whatever, it's just how you then attack it and what you're at the end of the day, it's you're offering your messaging, you know, how leveraged it is. So like you you're working and you're focusing on YouTube right now because it's getting super leveraged results. It's free, they're highly targeted and they're turning in the buyers.
00:43:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So nothing can beat that. Justin Brooke, lots of Dan will tell you nobody beats YouTube for cost for leads.
00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:43:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the last couple of years, nobody has YouTube for cost for leads. Facebook ads. So, you know, just just something to be talking about like why, why YouTube, why are you doing this? It's not a shiny object and maybe even speaking to the elephant in the room. Hey, you might think like I'm a shiny object. like I'm always chasing different things, but really what it is is I'm a marketing expert and I love to study the channels, and I like teach people along for the ride with me. So you're speaking to the elephant in the room, but it's also the lurkers, like hey, yeah, yeah, always a little embedded message for them.
00:44:20 - Maria Gudelis
Well, yeah, I mean, I think if we were having this conversation three weeks ago, I didn't think I would have really a YouTube course, but the videos, like, yeah, it's crazy. This one video has now got that I published, I'm looking at the stats here on September 28th. So a month ago today, or two days ago, month ago, 17,784 views and 66 comments, and then another video that doesn't have as many views, but still doing too bad, let's see, scroll down to it. This was from October 17th, so like two weeks ago, has 3,680 views, 39 comments, all 39 Those are good love karma comments like so much value. You're so authentic. And the people that bought the $500 console calls with me, I asked them, which particular video do you remember that you watch? Oh, hang on, I actually saved it. She goes and and looks at it tells me it's the one where he said, you drew on the whiteboards with three circles and everything. And that's the one that has 3,680.
00:45:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should just come visit me and we just just stay here for a week and let's make a lot of content together.
00:45:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yes, so fun.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I've got the kids, so I can't really trouble. then like, but we could do dual videos like we could use Riverside and like like like this relates to the podcast.
00:45:38 - Maria Gudelis
We want to start to I saw a podcast today, but I thought, Oh, that's the name similar to what we would probably love to have. It had something about I think it had the word success growing your company, but it was it. He no longer has a podcast. He switched it to inputs only. He changed the podcast name to inputs only. But before it, it had something to do with the word success. Um, scaling, but also or growing, but also, like, just living your life. forget, oh, I wish I wrote it down, but, you know, me, a little bit of a podcast geek when I'm driving. I'll just come to listen to various ones, but I was thinking, Oh, that'd be good one for us.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause yeah, we would have a blast cause I'm already, you know, my energy was people would have a blast listening. I can't tell you how many people are like, you should write a book. should have a podcast and like, I don't want to, but to talk to you, it's just yeah, and even, even just the strategy of how you're analyzing the sales page and the name and the knowledge is like, if we had recorded that, that would be gold for people. Are we still recording?
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis
That we're, yeah, yeah, we did. We did. We do have a record. I mean, but we could actually just do like, Hey, we know we're going to record it. We could actually just do it like a play by play of, here's what we did.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And here's, yeah, so, but that could be repurposed. Even from Fathom, if we ever like, you know, that was old. So we've got the audio. And also, it records to my computer.
00:47:03 - Maria Gudelis
always cancel it and don't do it, but if you go like save that, we want to hide that.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you know, we might not be dressed appropriately or whatever. So we can use an image and it can have, you know, how it has the sound thing that's going while the person's talking.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can have that and then we can have like a slide on the back or screen share. So there would be more video editing, but if we get a good video at the that's low cost, that we can just say, Hey, this is what I want you to do. This was the highlight. This was the section. We can pre-preperate in like this script or something like that because then we can very easily edit down to the very specific clip that we want. And then just say, Okay, here's her image. There's my image. This is what we want you to see. These are the screenshots that we want you to put at this time stamp, this time stamp, then it's time stamp, then you've got an excellent video and you can
00:48:00 - Maria Gudelis
you know we could do talking head over it like hey we just wanted to introduce this topic we were talking we did this and then so maybe it's a 20 second clip of us introducing it but we're like on camera and then i love it i love it yeah no i mean because we energized each other like i was my energy was fading you know an hour ago and then now i'm like all excited again that's how i get when i talk to you yay i was already in a good place because i just came from my mission thing but for sure when i'm like and then Maria was like hey hey yeah yeah but also and and also the other reasons for doing this you too i gotta say is that um and i don't know if i've told you this because like we haven't really chatted like this for a while but i think i said this to one of my other friends um who like we've we've been business partners even years ago and she's a good friend for the last like you know 10 years and i just had care like you know both of us have been doing facebook ads for clients since 2000 12 like I think we've because of that and because we're still damn good at it We've had blinders on because I I can't believe over the last you know a few weeks the YouTube stuff that's happening And the sales coming in I mean like it and it just still is growing whereas in Facebook if we do a video You know unless you keep putting ad spent on it. It's dead.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It goes into a desert of no eyeballs Oh in Hamza Fez He's a cancer survivor.
00:49:31 - Maria Gudelis
he said one good YouTube video live YouTube video will outperform every single Facebook post of an entire year Wow Yeah, and I believe that now and and so crazy because I've been in all this blinders and Even all the groups have been in and more like create your offer do adds to it Like I've been for since 2012 when I started my first maybe it's 11 when I first saw my first Facebook ads Learning from Frank that they had to do ads. So that is like over a decade of just fricking on only one racetrack of traffic. Owen Hemsa. Okay, yeah. Oh, look at that. Even on YouTube channels for high-performance professionals. Oh, here go.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now people, you know, you remember when QR codes came out and everybody was like, this is not gonna last, this doesn't work, and it's gonna take a while. Now is the time to use them. Now, almost everybody knows how to use them. They're not nearly as glitchy. And without doing a URL, and just with the click of a camera, and especially if they can make them clickable now, that's the biggest thing is, because most people are taking a picture on their phone. I just use my phone on there to go to a site now. Yeah, yeah, I mean, he definitely gets marketing. He's got the charisma. He beat cancer naturally after chemo almost beat him. So he's special. He's out. up there. But he's definitely doing the numbers and knows the stats and things like that and I think that you'll enjoy him. But yes, we can be in an echo chamber, we can just be cutting off the ends of the turkey to make it fit in the pan and we don't know why you've got to do that.
00:51:20 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, and hey, listen, I'm on his side looking as a fractional CMO service.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's interesting. And without me knowing about him, like, yeah, this does dovetail nice in the pocket CMO CMO service. It does because it is marketing and it's a very specific channel and strategy. But I don't know of one that beats it. So if anybody's going to be doing CMO work for somebody, they should be going about YouTube.
00:51:49 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, interesting.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you said we're not meeting tomorrow, you have plans tomorrow?
00:51:56 - Maria Gudelis

and then we're talking about do we want to try to find a building when this thing expires or do we want to like keep renting because right now the rental rate that we got for a square foot is actually really good in the other space. Does make sense to take over the entire 6-4 which would double our space and are we going to need that kind of space or we're not going need that kind of space like does it even make sense to go down that route right just logically kind of talking it out and then it became where do we see ourselves in three or five years and yeah that's where it started kind of going off the rails. That would be where the most specificity would be helpful because that's the conversation we have and I've been trying to get as I'm always trying to grow and grow and grow and compare myself to everybody. else and wanting to grow and she's waiting for us to plateau to slow like okay where is the top of it where is it and why are you constantly pushing for higher goals?
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.
00:10:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, and like it's never a straight line either.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Yeah, for sure.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
It is not. Yeah, I thought ended this year would be more consistent in those hundred incidences or not. We've been kind of stuck in that mid 80 range. Yeah.
00:10:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that's the which we know is the reason we try to get as many vendors as we can because other people are pulling your vendors and whether they're doing it with money where they're doing it with negotiations, promises, friendships. don't know, but there's a whole lot of variables that go into how you get those. How good they are at running ads, how much it costs them to run ads. have the ad platforms are doing. Are they, are they improving, you know, their ability to run ads in a costly manner? other deal that you could have, but I mean, that's almost kind of in-house, right? You've got that internal connection, but it's you having conversations around this topic that has been the gateway really to getting more vendors, getting more leads, and that is not something that you do as consistently as could be done. I don't think it's bad at all. don't think it's neglected, but, and I don't know that it could go faster. I don't know that you could do more. There's something that has to be organic about some of these conversations, but I don't know if it's always top of mind for you or if you make time for it on a weekly basis.
00:12:52 - mark sweet
What do you think? No, it's definitely in spurts, so it'll be three or four hours at one time.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, and that's that's something though those are friends and because of the nature of it and everything we know about it that I don't need to tell you. I don't know that doing it more often would be better, but I don't know that it wouldn't.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Yeah. No, I don't know.
00:13:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do know that you're the guy.
00:13:22 - mark sweet
That's all I know. No, it's true. And we got to sit through a lot of them. Just even by ones that were falling up with them from there, not all of them are great. Yeah, what does that happen with that magnetic one?
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you say?
00:13:39 - mark sweet
Remember that magneto? I don't think that's going to come together.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, that's Mary's husband, right? Yep. That's that's awesome.
00:13:54 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how much money does he make off of you every every month.
00:14:02 - mark sweet
Not very much.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not great. We make more money from him than he makes for my song.
00:14:09 - mark sweet
Yes and no. I mean, well, we paid like two plus years from the build up this network that does get him money.
00:14:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:14:18 - mark sweet
had coming out of pocket for it. We are paying all the hard costs and everything else. Okay. seats were not in. He is more than free to sell. So like we connect him to issue intake. I don't know what happened to that at the end of the day.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What else does he do to our money?
00:14:34 - mark sweet
Oh, he's a regular job.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much does he make at it?
00:14:38 - mark sweet
I have no idea.
00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea where I'm going with this?
00:14:44 - mark sweet
You?
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what can we do? He clearly has skills because Dan can do three for this month from him. Yeah, I mean, but so far as I know his costs. less than everybody else is other than the whole network set up. And last month it was like eight, like he's been on a roll.
00:15:12 - mark sweet
No, he's, this is the worst month, that's fine.
00:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what would it, you know, is there a potential room to explore or having him try to get leads any other way through any other platform is his knowledge transferable to ads on another platform. What would it take to pay him for that? And considering, so let's consider like, what, what if he was a employee instead and got a, just hear it all the way out because this is his first version of this thought, right? Got a salary. Would that salary not be cheaper? And we we know that he can get us some business and and would he not be motivated if like he doesn't have a great job he could work from home he could do it okay he could do it more at his leisure but also he could get side gigs if he just becomes really good at getting ads or whatever you could have him sign a non-compete or something or maybe particular types of whatever but what is another way that we can architect a deal here with him where we get some of what's clearly a good brain unless he's just really lucky but I would not say so no not at this level yeah exactly so where you could make you sweet law more of a priority and buy some loyalty from somebody who I mean I don't know I don't know what his other job is and how much he gets paid and how great it is but
00:17:00 - mark sweet
I'm gonna guess he's like 150 to maybe 200.
00:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's, let's go look at Lidify and see how many retainers he sent us this year. Okay. Reports. Let's open, okay. don't want my favorites. I want to start to report. So matters, no, it's matters by state by source status. Maybe that one. Let me shift screen so we look at this.
00:17:40 - mark sweet
So June to September, was doing pretty good. It was a lot of like one, one, one for a while. I'm starting in June, it was 10, July 16, August 14, September 12, 10, remember we're at three.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. numbers to me again.
00:18:01 - mark sweet
So June was 10.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:07 - mark sweet
July was 16. August was 14. September was 12. October was 10.
00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna add in the three. So what is the average retainer worth to you?
00:18:22 - mark sweet
Five grand.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that math is 325,000 since June. Roughly. That's super dirty math. know. But it's to give you a concept of could we hire him and pay him as a salary instead of by leads and then give him. So it's not free. Right.
00:18:50 - mark sweet
So we look at the voices.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. And then so that he's motivated to up his game.
00:19:00 - mark sweet
We're spending about 30,000 a month.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a lot. So that was June, July, August, September, October, six months, nine, six. Yeah, and what I, how much did I tell you?
00:19:15 - mark sweet
hundred and thirty five, I think?
00:19:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So three hundred and thirty five minus two hundred and twenty eight. So that's a hundred and seven thousand. And then you obviously have to have profit. but what if we said, hey, like, if you thought that you get us 20 retainers a month steadily through this and other means within roughly the same profit margins, would you be interested in a salary job with, I don't know if they need benefits or anything?
00:19:54 - mark sweet
No, she, he gives it to her.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, and, but with an incentive program. of, you know, if the margins are X and the number is X, then you get this. It could be a tiered performance. So the better he does, the better he gets paid without cutting into the margin. So the tiered should also be built in your favor so that, you know, you're getting more money as he's performing well and paying him better. I have no idea. was just a tangent that we went on. But I get the thought process with it.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
not. It's worth a conversation to have.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really what I'm saying.
00:20:41 - mark sweet
Do you think this can do a lot more?
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so and the other, the reason I would even consider it is he figures something out. He went from one of these two Z's to the number that he has when we struggled to get roughly that amount of number from. big boy agencies. So something's happening there. And there's no way, and I don't know how to say this diplomatically and not be wrong, but Dan can't replicate what he's done.
00:21:19 - mark sweet
I don't have little to do what I would, and I hope he'd be able to do, quite frankly.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because of my situation, I'm just going to leave that at that. But my point is there is a powerful brain. Oh, for sure. But there's a powerful brain at your disposal right now, who is doing something everybody else that you're paying doesn't seem to be doing as consistently. Now we're three, and it's November 21st. So maybe something dropped, but maybe I don't know, maybe something's going on at home. And maybe it has nothing to do with how the market is or whatever. I don't know. It's even more reason to have a conversation because he's been doing great and now just dipped a little bit. I'm a huge fan of capitalizing on human resources in a reciprocal way, right? How can we be a blessing to you and ensure you continue being a blessing here? Also my help Mary's attitude little bit if he's like, I love Mark.
00:22:30 - mark sweet
No, she thinks both of us are stupid.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, no. What are the odds?
00:22:36 - mark sweet
I'm pretty high.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That you're both stupid? Really? Are you dumb boys?
00:22:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, pretty much.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dumb boy things.
00:22:48 - mark sweet
I didn't think you were wrong. It's it is what it is. I need to jump in a different way there and keep the money component out of our economy. patients and keep her to think she's really good at which is training people.
00:23:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A compartmentalizing and keeping her in a job role that works for her. It's not a bad thing when people have employee mindsets. Where would we be without those people who are like, you just want to show up and do the job and then want to go home? I don't want to own the business, don't want all that responsibility. Those are the people that show up and run our businesses without taking it away from us and selling it to the highest bidder. We need those people badly, but you really need to know who they are and you need to, like you say, show up for them and ask of them only what really they can handle well. What we want to do is the same reason people get and stay in bad relationships is because it's comfortable and it's there. It's what in front of you, and it's a lot of work breaking somebody else in, but that is not the way to excellence, that's not the way to growth, that's not the way to even being happy in the end, no matter what it is, even if it's a professional relationship. Yeah, so, you know, there's been, you may have grown out of the relationship you had with Mary, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a place, but I mean your perspective of what she was to you, is to you, whatever your right hand, which Dan and I would both disagree with, but we both know we're not there every day. I don't know if Salka would disagree, but Salka would disagree, he's probably just probably disagreeing no matter what.
00:24:52 - mark sweet
Right, with an extremely low turnover.
00:24:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:24:56 - mark sweet
They're extremely low turnover, it's not because we're- Overpaying people.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm not saying she's not amazing and great, but but And what it was Yeah, but I mean you go into any corporation and you've got, you know, executive officers doing their job And that's their job. That's that's just all it is It's an executive officer showing up the way that they're supposed to. They're not necessarily the right hand now the vp. Yes but But VP is going to be over everything a VP of just the company right not vp of sales and vp of Whatever human resources that there's depending on how big you get, you know, this structure changes the names change the title change, but you know very rarely Does somebody actually have a right hand and when you do That relationship that they identified in rocket fuel generally is the actual one where you've got a legitimate, real-life, bona fide visionary and integrator and you are not what I would call a bona fide visionary, like I feel like you have a little bit fall on the spectrum of the integrator which is actually really good, you'll do matter that way, but it means that you don't have as much of a need to have a person that can do all the things and so you didn't have to go find one of those. You were able to compartmentalize and find different types of leaders in your organization and even create them not just me. So anyway, like I said, there's a lot more that you and I could be working on but it takes more time and digging into some of these conversations. If I could understand more of the mechanics of what Mary is doing and what Mary it wants, and obviously probably not with talking to Mary, but you and I, you explaining it well, we could probably find the, the, um, hold on a second, I'm just making sure it's not a child messing and messaging me.
00:27:15 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:27:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the, like the ideal roles and responsibilities really were, um, but then also changing what conversations you have, um, as a result of it and not counseling about certain types of decisions. Now, you would need a replacement who would you counsel with in, in those things and make sure that, you know, who you're going to for that because otherwise, you're going to end up going back to Mary and then, and then you've now kind of encroached on, on what you had tried to create as a compartment. So we need to make sure, All of that is taken care of, but the better place to start is what do you want to build with Sweet Law in the next one, three, five years? And those are separate visions, but I would work backwards from five years. So what would you like it to look like in five years and then let's break it down going backwards?
00:28:39 - mark sweet
It's something I've been thinking about more and more, like where are you trying to get to and do I want to get to and why, by the way, make sure that why is in there.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your, what is the thought that you come to most often? And.
00:29:00 - mark sweet
question. in terms of the wire, in terms of the numbers.
00:29:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Period. So anything, like, what is the thought that comes into your head most often when you think about, like, where am I going?
00:29:16 - mark sweet
So this is morbid. I'm just saying that just to kind of brace you for it little bit.
00:29:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I doubt you're going to shock me because you don't know the thing my head does.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
But it's not my normal, like, thought process. Because if you and my thought process is like, I just want to grow because it's fun. It's exciting. It's way more fun than just running a stable ship, which is just running the day-to-day. there's nothing super exciting about it. more just putting up basic fires, right? Mm-hmm. difference is I think I probably have, I mean, I pray it's all wrong, but around 30 years left until I'm done. And so, More than half my life is gone. I need to do everything I can to just. maximize as much as possible in the short period of time. And. With what we do with what the risk we take. It's not. same trying to double from where we are from where I started.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So.
00:30:27 - mark sweet
I know. I know what we do. I know how we treat our clients and it's different than everyone else. Additionally, there's this, you know, book man of. Outside funding BC money, other firms coming in. That's always kind of hanging around out there. If we get to the point where we're a certain size, we have a bit of a built in moat where we can absorb a back quarter or whatever it may be. Does that make some sense?
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:31:00 - mark sweet
And it's not necessarily coming from a place of fear. That's not what the goal that is.
00:31:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, hold on. I have to ask this before we go on because you said you need to maximize this, build it as big as it can be or something.
00:31:14 - mark sweet
was that language? Yeah, something like that.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why?
00:31:23 - mark sweet
So, when I die, there's enough to take care of everyone.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is everyone?
00:31:28 - mark sweet
Everyone.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need you to be specific because clearly you can't be in everyone in the world. You mean everyone in your family? Do you mean everyone in sweet law? And how, what does that look like? We have to get clear on this definition. Huh? Yes, you both. Okay. What does it look like to take care of everyone in sweet law when Mark isn't here anymore?
00:31:54 - mark sweet
I don't have an answer for that yet.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Let's talk some logistics. First of all, second generation wealth is almost always wasted. The people that receive it don't have the discipline and the respect and the knowledge of how to manage the money to keep what is given to them. It's almost never worth what is given to them. What is put in in order to be able to give it to them? That's the truth. Those are the stats. So in terms of providing for Chona and do you have something for her?
00:32:49 - mark sweet
Yeah, potentially.
00:32:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we go from taking care of everybody too. Yeah, potentially. So this is the purpose though of the question.
00:33:00 - mark sweet
sounds with her because I know what's wrong. Sorry, come on, It's very nice, but yeah. So with my dad passing, you know, left money to my mom and everything else and she just does not want to spend any money on anything. So I know what's going to be left from that will be enough for my sister to be okay. You know, her house we paid for. She doesn't have huge lofty goals. She's just kind of happy with the status quo.
00:33:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, here's what I want you to do. We can either do this. Well done. You're not allowed to and I'm counting on Elon and Elon type brains. Not there really is one to like figure out how to make is like my is failing. I'm pretty sure like my kid is my pancreas like whatever my organs. I'm like, yeah, anyway, I'm in that boat of my body could shut down at any time and I feel it. So I'm not morbid. I'm just realistic, but I'm going to do everything I can to maximize and leverage it. And I'm not going to count on not being here. But every day, I'm like, let me purge this stuff. Let me make sure my files are in order. Let me make sure that everything is organized so that if I die, I'm not a burden to anybody and I leave as much as good as possible. So I'm with you on that. But you really need to define what it would be what and especially for like China because statistically women outlive their husbands anyway. And she's got a family and but I would really like you to write down a list and we can do this together. If you wanted to have a meeting and it's just you and me because this isn't a Dan thing, know. And this is more like what we're doing right now is more what I normally do regularly, anyway. There's just so much that you do. I would really like more time on it. I could do more for you. But sit down and let's make a list of like be specific about the names, specific about the amounts, specific about how you would have it managed like trust funds. What would you do? Like what would be the parameter of the trust funds so that you have a little bit of a specificity in the vision but also some peace and some targets. So then we have numbers that we know. Now, when we have target numbers and we could have target numbers for what happens if let's say something happens and you're gone and so one of the things and this is why I don't think it's morbid I had a client that I worked for and he was very he's Indian and Brainiac and he taught me so many things about numbers but he would always be like what do we do if you get hit by bus tomorrow like how do we know how to do your job and how does the company not suffer because you're not here so what happens if you get hit by bus or marry or anybody else right these are all the scenarios that we we want to take care of and make sure that we're planned for but you know let's say for some reason you're gone in five years let's say you're gone in ten years like what where could we be in five years to say that in in that five years you're in the best place possible and this is what you know you can leave in five years this is what you know you can leave in ten years So and then we kind of reverse engineer. So let's let's go with the 30 year plan, right? And you're, you're what, like 38 or something somewhere on that? Baby. I'm 40. what I'm trying to do. No, no, I know. But but I'm but I'm with you. And you know what your genetics are. There's there's all kinds of things in it. So anyway, so if we figure out, first of all, down who we're talking about taking care of specifically and what do you mean and taking care of them? And I don't mean like a number but a number that has a meaning. Could you live off of this number for how many years? Could you live off of this number and this number has enough money to make you interest for you to keep living off of as income for the rest of your life? Given this type of parameter and this house is
00:38:00 - mark sweet
You know what I mean? Like a full-on plan.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much money? What does it look like? How is it managed? And how does the money keep making money if possible at at at a chona like family level? And then what are the other people? And and what does it look like? So for sweet law could be a severance type package that is that has to be like if it goes for sale or something like that. Like what are the ways that you could provide for your team if something happened to you and you didn't have any like runway exit, right? Like you're just gone. There is no I got to chance. So everything is already put in place. And then what we have is just kind of like a baseline number and targets. Then what we do is go, okay, well here's the target, here's the time we're doing it here's the life I want to live during that time. I'm not going to be grinding away all week every week trying to... and for death. Because you should be planning for life. The best thing you can do for people here is not die for them, but live for them, you know, live with them. And so then what we have to do is look at basically effective hourly rate of your earnings. We have to look at how does your money work for you? How does your money make more money for you? Is it just sweet law? Are there other opportunities where you could be getting that money? And I think they can, especially with the people that you know, with the interests you have, with the willingness that you have to work and the skills that you are constantly acquiring. I think that there's a lot of opportunity for you to get that very leveraged income and wealth, but you really have to choose where you're spending your time. and that includes making the time for all the fun stuff that really make it even worthwhile for you. But it starts with the how you want to take care of people and what that specifically looks like so that we can work backwards from that because if that's what you care about most is how do I leave this world. That's what I think about every day. That goes into why I have so few clients but need to get paid so much because how I want to leave this world is first of all having spent the best not crying Tina quality time with everybody that I interact with no matter how it is. And I'm not. spiritually invested into and so that's number one so because at the end of every day like if I die today I can sit there while my eyes are closing and I'm on my way out going this is what I did that was good today and this is the lives I touched I didn't have a fight with anybody I didn't say bad things I didn't put hate into the world I did what I could to organize and to reduce burdens to increase them you know those types of things so it doesn't matter when I go there's not going to be any regrets that's one of the first things so in my architecting it's no regrets make sure that every day is spent in a way that's no regrets so that affects my time my energy who I'm spending it with and then the next thing is the finances like making sure that I'm not first of all never in a situation where I'm worried about money, which you know what I that experience, like I got to handle it because if I'm worried about it, then I'm thinking about it and being obsessed with money. And that puts me in a terrible mood, which means my experience is my first priority, which is the interactions I have with people every day. That suffers because my brain is somewhere else and it's in trouble and it's in stress and so it can't be in love and it can't be in encouragement, you know what I mean? So think about that would be one thing that you could do also. So what is the long term like when I leave this world, if I leave it, you know, years from now, decades from now, how would I like to leave it? But if I get called today, what can I have done today to make sure I'm not going , I wish I had not done this or done this differently. But then no matter what you do Mark is long as you are on that path every day. I Can't guarantee it because I haven't died yet, but I have been on the threshold several times. I Know what it feels like to know that your life can just slip out of your body I've been not close to death with illness so many times and I Do know what it feels like then just to be peaceful and just look like yeah, I did as much as I could up to now so That will help you with and but what I can tell you too is the correlation to how I run my business You can't really even call it that because technically it's just a glorified job If I don't work it doesn't work. There is no money. So it's a job, but But the way that I plan it is around that and not the other way around So, no, I don't think it's more of it. think it's great. think that solving that problem and being clear about what you want that to look like will help answer all the other questions I've been trying to pull out of you with more ease. And I also think that, I don't know, there's something very liberating about being able to look at it that way because, and you're already getting into this. So, think that you've kind of been doing some of this on your own, whether fully consciously or partially, but you can put things in perspective and realize, okay, this is good. I would like it to be better, but here's, this is good. This is good. is good. you know, basically good enough, but I want to do better. Like, there's this simultaneous kind of like, it's not even vacillating back and. between one, but it's like, it's not a hamster wheel, but it's almost like this circular thing of it's good enough for this moment, but it can be better.
00:45:12 - mark sweet
So let's keep going. You know what I mean? Yeah, like, this is fine. I'm okay with this.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or today. But tomorrow I want more and and not in an obsessive angry. I'm not satisfied with what we've accomplished or like, not I don't appreciate what's been done, but let's not lose momentum. Let's not waste this day. Yeah. That would be a great place to start. So do you want? All right. So next week, we're not having a Monday meeting because I'm flying. Did we reschedule that? I think we said we're not doing it because Dan's not working next week.
00:45:55 - mark sweet
It's Thanksgiving week.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. But we will meet
00:46:00 - mark sweet
Second, I'm not meeting with you guys. I think the way what? Because I have that AI conference on the third.
00:46:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. And trying to I cross that off on the 25th. Wait, no, that's Thanksgiving. OK, that's right. OK, so on the second, we're not meeting. Did we move it? We did not move it.
00:46:24 - mark sweet
I will be back on the fourth at some point. So the fifth Thursday, the fifth is totally fine.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it'll be a long day. Well, I really hope that Chona and I can move that call permanently.
00:46:41 - mark sweet
So I would be meetings are hard.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But Thursday, I can do Thursday or Friday that week. And if Dan can't, you and I can dig into this stuff more. You want to pick something?
00:46:55 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's fine.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, December, December 4th. It's my oldest daughter's birthday, and I will have been, roll this into me. This isn't about that. I'm telling you something. Sorry. On December 4th, I will have been a mother for four years, 24 years, 24 years, years. Yeah. Speak to you. Okay. Anyway, especially because I had a miscarriage before every single one of my children. I've been pregnant 10 times. have four babies. I worked for them. They were hard. All right. So Friday or Thursday, the only call I have to do is my 12 o'clock with Dan. And then as of right now, I still have Chona at 6 p.m. Friday, I don't have anything at all. They're totally fine.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
There's an interview before or after Dan, whatever like to keep that open. Yeah, that's totally fine.
00:47:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So let me move you. and if Dan accepts then yay and if not he'll just be you and me after that he'll be back to normalcy yeah okay well then we still have christmas week oh i don't think that that's going to be a problem for me actually i don't know about you guys well on december 5th you might have to move and time it later because i'm going have a small time change during the 16th and 23rd but small time change yeah oh we're in japan oh okay yeah that's a big time change well no not for us specific um it's a 17 hour time change oh well but it's it's fine because the new one is like just early morning there and it's fine yeah okay um so december 20 Third.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
The 16 and 23, we'll figure out. The twelve should be fine. If there's some issue, I'll let you know.
00:49:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The twelve.
00:49:12 - mark sweet
The sixteenth and twenty third. You mean it?
00:49:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, the 12th. M you mean. Yes. I thought you said 12 doesn't like the date. The 12th of my dude. We don't mean on the 12th. Okay. All right. Well, we'll do all of that. as it comes up. Okay, so I'm just looking at some of the stuff that we've been doing. Did you do any more research on the gift boxes since we talked about the monthly subscription thing?
00:49:55 - mark sweet
So yes, I also talked to a couple of different doctors that I'm. fairly friendly with just kind of pick their brains of what they would like. It's interesting that the smaller ones are like, now the doctor makes the decision. The bigger ones are like, yeah, I know the front desk like hands out cards. So, not surprisingly, we're gonna have to think about who gets what.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:50:18 - mark sweet
The one that was like, yeah, look, I would love to just get wine in the mail. Like, I'm stoked for why. No one is like, we eat healthy, like, I would like fruit and then staff would like fruit. The ones like girls in front like, I don't care. So it was helpful, not helpful, but helpful. All of them kind of report the same thing of in the last three years, they've seen the number of things they call unattached, basically unrepresented clients way down compared to what they saw three years ago. And the ones that they are seen that are unrepresented are not cases we would. Take.
00:51:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is doctor's offices.
00:51:10 - mark sweet
These are chiropractors.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:51:15 - mark sweet
And those are the ones who really target me. Like I love Fuji, right? Like we love working with him, but the chance that he comes across the case that doesn't already have an attorney attached to it is super low unless it's a personal friend.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where are there other doctors that might. Yes. Okay.
00:51:39 - mark sweet
But there's a lot of them that will want things for that. Yeah. That I am not getting near. I understand it's legal in Arizona. I'm still getting near.
00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like ER doctors?
00:51:57 - mark sweet
Yep. want another super fun car? and somebody will pay that. Oh, yeah.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can't really compete with that or won't compete with that. Okay. Well, Dr. Rufundrels want a huge thing. They're not, but I don't just need things. Sorry, what?
00:52:27 - mark sweet
I would love to find a way to increase that. mean, we're at one Dr. Rufundrel, this one, that's low. And so if we're sending so much business out, I mean, there's plenty of people who say, you know, look, for every two I send you, I'm expecting to get one back. But the quality of those cases usually aren't aren't there.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:55 - mark sweet
So I'm just trying to find other ways to generate cheaper cases. a lack of better term.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:03 - mark sweet
And there's, you know, other benefits that the doctors always like you're going get your bills and reports faster, we can ask for certain things like, hey, can you squeeze in this patient or whatnot, you know, things that if you don't have a good relationship or, you know, we didn't pay them well. I'm sorry, I can't, you know, put that person in say we're full.
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:26 - mark sweet
So it's more just constant process and constant ups and downs. And it's always how it's been with these different, you know, providers and vendors, but we've talked about it before, we've gone, we've done stuff, we haven't done stuff with how can we keep putting it.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if you found somebody like an order we are downer that worked? I don't know if they could do this or not. Worked at the hospital and paid them to rock their car with your stuff.
00:53:56 - mark sweet
So it's a little little tricky. Because you are not supposed to solicit clients at a emergency scene, if you will, directly. And directly is the key word, because the TVs that are on an emergency room have lower ads on them, right? Right. There's bus benches outside the hospitals, which have lower ads on them. So it's not impossible, but it's, uh, it's right. It's online and it could work. I'm not saying I can't, but, you know, what's the difference in hiring a jam to do that or just, you know, buy a junk car and just park you there every day?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's going to get towed and, you have, it has to have a reason to be there parking is usually not right out from where you'd be able to see it. But, like, depending on what the major hospitals are, is there a fast food place or something? where you could pay one of their employees and to wrap their car and so it gets seen frequently by people in the vicinity who just visited somebody who were in the hospital and got in a wreck and like it's really just top of mind and where are people from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented but represented where are they wherever they're at that's where you want to be but it doesn't have to necessarily be the same places that everybody else is like how can you think outside of the box a wrapped car like thoroughly wrapped could say a lot could catch a lot of attention and you do that at times a few around hospitals not in them not on the parking lot but in locations that are close to it where people might even be stopping or people visiting might be stopping like you know what I mean like is in a high-pop We did area. The fact that the chance that that doesn't get you a case from time time, know, buildings, you know, why else would you be doing that? Right. Yeah. So, I mean, and that wouldn't cost that much. Really, like somebody's driving their car anyway. And you pay for the rap, whatever that costs, you know, maybe $1,000. And then you pay them to drive it and say, well, I'll pay $500 a month to have your car wrapped. And then how many times could you do that? And basically have a walking advertisement that's going everywhere all the time with your ads on it. And it's moving. And if you're talking about a fast food worker, guess who they're around all the time. The poor people that need representation if they get in the break. And probably the ones are likely to get in Iraq, lower income, more drugs, working later nights, driving while exhausted or intoxicated. It's just it's the status quo. It's just that's that's just the reality of it. I'd try it. I put my knee in it.
00:57:25 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's worth trying. We tried the LED trucks. I don't know if you know it at all.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's an LED truck.
00:57:33 - mark sweet
They're a box truck covered in LED TV.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm going to go around sporting events.
00:57:40 - mark sweet
Huh, never generated. But I keep doing it. So that way, someone said I saw you in the billboard or saw you when I was driving. And they really maybe thought someone else that has a similar name hypothetically. I got to do those. I don't know where they saw it. Right.
00:58:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but in terms of like where to run ads, where to put ads with their physical or digital, where are people going from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented? Yeah. And is the time of representation window decreasing? Probably is based off of what you just said. What was that window? What is that window? we know? And what does that mean? Why did it decrease? Are people more aware?
00:58:44 - mark sweet
people? Awareness has definitely gone up.
00:58:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. And it will, and in this, because we live in an information world, right? social aspect of it means people are telling their stories and other people are learning from other people. stories and so they you know maybe they didn't know a brother or uncle or somebody in their immediate family but because of Facebook they know somebody that they don't even really know but now they're like what I know how to handle this because um but even being I mean driving how many billboards now or ball from billboards well can you can you run ads in and on podcasts are there podcasts like true crime podcast that freaking so many people huh yeah the geotarget the what target do you target you wouldn't want to add right no right but big podcasts might do geotargeting ads geotargeted ads that um you can get multiple platforms too so you know we have not talked about that that's not traditional radio I wouldn't consider it traditional radio because of the the social aspect of it. And I think most people aren't going to skip a really short ad like that. don't think you can in podcasts. Yeah. Are your competitors doing that? You know, I don't know if they are, but I would imagine the majority of them aren't yet. I don't think that podcasts have been topped very well, but they're going to keep growing. So that's something to look into. If you know what is the highest, you know, time, like when do the most accidents occur? What time of day? What day of the week? Run ads then or right after those times.
01:00:45 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't got we haven't. I'm going to put this on that list.
01:01:03 - mark sweet
2020, which is pretty outdated at this point, found that lawyers spent 400 million on just TV commercials.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On just TV commercials? Yep.
01:01:18 - mark sweet
And then data from sensor towers, so take all that with a large grain of salt, and Morgan and Morgan spent 40.3 million on digital ads in 2023. Oh, sorry. 240 million was just what Morgan and Morgan spent.
01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's? I'm sharing, you know, the thing is, what should I... spreadsheet. I showed it you. was working on earlier this week. just shared that with you. Identify what the time accident to represent.
01:02:43 - mark sweet
Look, everything's worth a shot. We tried the radio thing. That didn't work. Radio clearly works to someone, but didn't work for us. Things are worth trying. I know podcasts usually are
01:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I shared this talk with you just so you can just, like, if there's ideas that you have and we haven't talked about it, you can put it here, put it in the parking lot, and if we're, I'll put things in progress if we're working on it, but we'll get a little bit more organized and structured and then think about whether not you'd like to meet one more day a week so that we can just put, we can just be more structured, that we can get more results, there's a lot of things that have to be solved that only you inside of your company can solve, you don't have another person that's there doing this. There's just a lot, like, you have a big organization there's a lot of opportunity, there's a sufficient amount of risk, there's enough systems, there's enough departments, like there's a lot to be done. And I don't think you really have anybody leading any of it super well. think Mary does her part. I don't think that's nearly enough. So another hour a week, you know, if we did that for six months, we can make them significant momentum, I think, towards things, but it really should start with first. What does it look like to take care of everyone? Who is everyone? They need to have names or a very distinct description, right? And if it's everyone at Sweet Log, if they're all the same, if Mary is her own, you know, be really specific about the people and the categories of people because how you take care of them should look different, right, for all of them. And then we can like, okay, what does that number look like? Where are we at now? What's the gap that we have to bridge? How long would it take us to get there? And then we run every decision that we make through the filter of does that slow down our goal? Does that speed up our goal? Does that get in the way of it? Does that aid it? Take us off track? Any of the things? So start there and this is a good time of year to really be pondering that type of stuff. Naturally, people become more introspective this time of year. So, which is probably what's what's already happening with you it just it just does winter that you guys don't really have it but but it does it we have less sunshine that's a real impact um but the holiday is coming the end of the year closing you know there's there's a lot of different signals that we have that we may not have personally and purposefully given energy too but we're affected by them anyway so anyway it's just a good time to capitalize that while you're on some walks maybe um and if you get some thoughts maybe you can leave yourself an audio recording or you can drop me uh audio message or something like that and just kind of bring down to a text or signal or wherever or and no not signal if it disappears uh audio text though and uh let's let's do some planning and reverse engineer from the things that matter most at the life level because business is just a vehicle to get you there. Yep. I need to wrap up because I gotta go check on my little pole and get some stuff going but what's that?
01:07:22 - mark sweet
I'm gonna head home, it's only office.
01:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes. What it was like a baklava hamburger.
01:07:29 - mark sweet
What was that? Uh, so I just got followed up so they make like maledo cups.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did that? Mhm. Did you just tell me you did that?
01:07:41 - mark sweet
I didn't eat followedo. I bought the pre-made followedo and I made ground beef with.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You cooked?
01:07:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, I can cook. China can't cook. I can cook.
01:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, We know that like this has been since day one like this is not a surprise. Not like I thought she could cook like. Yeah, no. Love that that's funny though. Okay. Well whenever I come with me you guys you guys are you're making me dinner. So there All right, well head home, and I I'm not worried about it, I do think you know she's in a new season and Mike and And It's important to take that into account two kids changes you two kids and settling down with a man changes you and But I think those differences were already there that it's just the gap is getting bigger and it's okay we just need to create the the proper dynamic and then encapsulate it and let it let it stay there and It will create happiness for her and you and she'll still be useful, but I I do think that the the The way that you identify it probably should shift a little bit. I really can't speak until we have a much more in-depth conversation about the logistics. With the one hour that we have and how much we share of it with Dan, it's really hard for me, again, with the size of your organization and all of the moving parts to basically I get half an hour a week with it and it's just not enough to be really effective. So that's, I'm not going to be looking for any new clients, I've got all the things that I'm working on, but I would give more time to sweet loss.
01:09:39 - mark sweet
Were you able to hire that one person that you were trying to hire?
01:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but she was just not able to be consistent and reliable anyway, but what I did do is partner up with a lady who's been around as long as I have and so it's really kind of fulfilling and satisfying. I'm home by myself all the time, and I'm waiting. social for that. getting to have her has been has been helpful too. I'm still not in the surplus that I want to be, but I don't think I'm very far from that. So I'm glad for that. But yeah, that was just another reason I just I don't want different people. I got so blessed with the amazing people I have. If there was somebody just, you know, a magical fit. I'd work with them, but like I really particular about my people and I've just kept them a long time and I'm not looking for anybody new, but to be able to serve better and definitely be down for that. And and I have not been able to do what I wanted to do here anyway. So when you're ready for it, I want to do I think that there is so much more structure that we could put in place. And I also think that I could help with the mental load that you have and help you do than things more consistently, because we do have so many things that you're doing constantly. I don't think any of it is getting done as well as it could be because you're so divided.
01:11:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, definitely more the key directions.
01:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus, Mark calls make me smile. So I like how I would have more of that in my life. I think it's a thing. No, you always make me smile. You also make me annoyed sometimes.
01:11:32 - mark sweet
That's OK.
01:11:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the feeling is mutual. You don't have to.
01:11:40 - mark sweet
I just to just want to bring it better. that's what everything just comes down to. And you know that about me when I get frustrated with my reality.
01:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I wouldn't want it to let like if you were not, if you were any way, it wouldn't be real and I have no interest in that. Like if you don't get frustrated, that means you don't. about it.

Hello.
00:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Hello.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how is Dan Ryan today? Mark's dog has pneumonia.
00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone
You won't.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ronin.
00:00:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. I'll call him said dog.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The neighbor dog had pneumonia and they didn't tell.
00:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone
The neighbor.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone
Ouch.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:30 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. That's... pneumonia is communicable among dogs.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it's viral, it is. Well, you also know. Because there's viral and bacterial pneumonia. back then, viral is always contagious. And he has to be on 10 days of medication. he said they have to cancel their trip to New York. So I'm guessing at his mom and somebody. I don't know who, but... And him and Jonah are on a vacation together right now. So... that's probably super stressful for him.
00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh yeah.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. My dog. She's got this weird like dark spot growing like her hair. She's getting this dark spot all of a sudden. She's a poodle and a bichon frise so they don't have spots and it's dark and it's wiry and I'm like what the crap is going on? I don't have a tumor or something and she bit as she tried to like bite a skunk in the butt before the sun even came up a couple days ago. That was a terrible way to wake up because my daughter's like mom she's foaming at the mouth and I didn't know if she was my daughter or the dog because she was just going to seminary.
00:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. we discussing right now?
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like I'm trying my best not to cuss everybody out right now but don't tell me nothing like a name. Stop.
00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Follow me.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone
Whoever it is.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it still smells. So it's been a good doggy week. All right, let's get on to this. It's funny because when I go into my notes, I have it's just weird, actually. I don't know if this was a new notebook because because this, hold on, these cannot be from 2022. The notes date says October 2022, but like thing I'm a jig and is in here.
00:02:37 - Dan’s iPhone
That's 2022.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:02:40 - Dan’s iPhone
There's no way we're talking about that recently.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, no, I know, but I think it was way longer ago than that.
00:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, no, probably not.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm to go look at my notebook and see if like there's more here or something because usually, anyway, the oldest note is at the top. I feel like there must have been... whatever. that was just funny. Okay, here's the call log for fan flow remarks had sent it to Dan, but I've saved it to the fan flow you know as well. What do I want to call log for fan flowy? Oh, fan flowy, not okay. Okay, that's what that is what I wanted.
00:03:32 - Dan’s iPhone
I got it.
00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, taking a break from G4 because we're working on fan flow in mom and mapping out all the stuff, ads, ad copy, lead, mac and neck, superfan, band growth system and waiting for the book And Stacy was supposed to give you a task to complete your GA for container by the time we'll for goes live. So we're trying to do that happen.
00:04:12 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't log into team works.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I couldn't tell you. Well, did you did you create the content where we are?
00:04:19 - Dan’s iPhone
What's today that I have a created container now, but it's not. When he first he's working launching. I actually did work on it a little yesterday. It's worth of percentage value.
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But even though you don't work log into teamwork, are you still meeting with Stacy and Eric Monday, Wednesday and Friday?
00:04:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm just saying that like I don't like if she I thought you were asking, did she create the task and teamwork? I literally have no idea. Um, I use teamwork only to respond to like tasks that exist. So I know. Yeah, sometimes I log in, like mostly I respond to email, but if I have to upload stuff, I tend to log in. So I just logged in to respond to Greg.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, are you still meeting with them every Monday, Wednesday, Friday?
00:05:19 - Dan’s iPhone
Yep.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. Write it down.
00:05:23 - Dan’s iPhone
Just going to get more. Their favorite meaning.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So does Stacy ask you about tasks then?
00:05:40 - Dan’s iPhone
We do a thing called, so we also have like a, I know if you know this. But maybe if you've heard this one before. So once a month, we have an in person meeting. It's the last something of the month. Again, I forget what the schedule is. Pick it to Friday. I think it's the last Friday of every month, and in that meeting, we go through everything. Anything like it's old, it's new, it's anything that she has on this other sheet that she maintains. And then the Thursday after that meeting is called Old Test Thursday, where I'm only supposed to work for kind of old tasks, which is another sheet that she maintains that I reference when it's that Thursday. And sometimes I knock those things out, but that list is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. We might not need to keep doing that. A bunch of them are woofer based, they'll be done at this moment. But yeah. So yeah, we go over everything, topped about them on that one thing, and then on that she just pings me like, hey, have you seen this? Someone commented back on this, right? So, Like, that was what just happened, somebody, like, I didn't know it, but for like a month, my basis email wasn't working. So I wasn't getting emails from anybody at all. So if they emailed to that note, I was emailing out from D&D or whatever, but I figured it, and I fixed it. But she'll like pin me on tasks that are like static or, you know, sitting there, she's like, Hey, someone, they comment to back, you need to go look at this. But she'll bring that up on the calls to, Hey, sometimes she sends slacks and opens, let's go look at it right now. Yeah.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I have a couple of questions for her and teamwork. So that will help me. so have you, this is what I thought was going to happen, but just wanted to check, did you not work on anything with GA before between last weekend now?
00:07:56 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I do. Oh, you did start. Yeah, I just started. Mapping out like, some of the stuff from Mercer was like, he uses these, I think they're called templates. Am I ever wrong? But there's, I think they're templates. There's template libraries in GTM. We have never used them. So I was mapping out like, hey, we're not going to do, giving you an example, clarity. So Microsoft Clarity, we're doing it the old way, where you paste the HTML. The new way is to use the Clarity template. The same thing would apply to like Hotjar, but we don't use Hotjar anymore. But it may be Wistia. I was looking at like, okay, we got to start using templates where there are templates. So yeah.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like they have templates for Hotjar and Wistia or there.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah, it's like a look. There's like search area where you can search for templates. So there's those and then there's like one other one that I cannot remember the name of. So yeah, don't think that one exists anymore. That was one of the questions I asked them, but they were referencing another one that doesn't exist or so we'll be using that. I asked them how we're doing that now. They explained it to me. can't learn one.
00:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're getting super deep and growly voice where I can't understand you.
00:09:42 - Dan’s iPhone
Listen, I can't help my voice.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can help your voice.
00:09:47 - Dan’s iPhone
God gave it to me.
00:09:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sing.
00:09:50 - Dan’s iPhone
So you definitely know how to help your voice. Sorry. Yeah, so that's it. Just like, oh, hey, we need you. templates where there are templates but these are the templates that we use and then like we're no longer like hot showers out where we that used to be part of our container will no longer be in our container. Oh the other bit is uh well I didn't do this but I just remember this kind of uh gotta send this to Norio but they said do not use visual website optimizer in GTM which I've experienced that issue but they're like yeah don't do it. I gotta figure out a way if we can put that I'm gonna have Norio add like a scripts area to the GTMizer that I can just load grips in which is probably good secret.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need to have Norio add scripts area to what?
00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone
GTMizer I mean it's literally for PWA on our communities. for theirs. It should just be like VWM and no one would use it. I mean, you could use it otherwise, but we'll maybe mark it as VWO.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Does Optimize that you've been existing anymore or Crazy Egg?
00:11:23 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know about Crazy Egg, but Optimize that he does, I believe.
00:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:11:29 - Dan’s iPhone
But I've got like this grandfather account with VWO and never letting it go. Yeah. Yeah. 60 bucks a month.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:11:39 - Dan’s iPhone
You mean these?
00:11:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Wait, what the? Oh, I must have it open into windows. That's not useful. So, let me look at this. What date is this October 4th? So you came up with the model, so the SaaS model plus coaching plus buying catalogs plus sign artists slash rev share plus distribution revenue streams and you might not say you need to model how the revenue will look percentages of each of that. for you and the guys. So what's the situation with buying was it lands down.
00:12:33 - Dan’s iPhone
Superrolls, oh, lands down. I don't know. I'm really talked about. I met with.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:44 - Dan’s iPhone
I was going to run up by Rhonda because so meet with her next week, I think I was going to run up by her, but then I met with this dude. This guy that. Joe interviewed on his podcast of the two. Oh, so the podcast the guy said. a couple of interesting things. So, many, many years ago, think it was Ezra Fierstown. I don't know where he said this, but he, I don't know if he was on a podcast or something, but he was talking about like, you know, he started making all this money and then he had like a tax person and then the whole, the whole thing, right, like around and he said, but then he was also starting to get around people had more money than him. And one of those guys said to him, hey, if you're a tax person and CFP makes less money than you do, then you need a new tax person than CFP. And he's like, because they can't, they, how can they possibly do that, right? They don't know what it's like to make that much money, like they don't know what it's like to, and I was like, that's an interesting point, like, like, why would I like, I wouldn't go hire someone to run ads that hadn't run as as well as I had, right? So I'm like, what would you, right? But you don't think about it in those terms of the thing. That sort of stuck with me, but I never really did anything about it. And then like, you know, Rhonda, not the bag I'm wrong, but right. Rhonda doesn't listen to me, right? Rhonda's executing Rhonda's plan, which I get, right? So her plan is like conservative. have a target. We're trying to, we're trying to end up where you're maintaining the same lifestyle until into your 90s so that you never run out of money. And that's a common sort of plan. It's certainly better than the plan I had. And so she's working that plan. And then the dude that Joe was interviewing said something like, you have a tax preparer, or do you have a tax planner, these like a tax. preparer looks backwards and then says this is how much money you owe. He's like a tax planner looks forward and they say they look at how much money you might owe and then they put strategies in place to mitigate that. And he's like if you have a tax preparer you need to have a tax planner and he's like that makes a lot of sense. And then he was doing some other stuff like you've probably seen the whole infinite banking or the family bank thing that comes up every five years. It's back.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think is always thinking about that and wanting to work on it.
00:15:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I'll send you this dude. I like this dude. I talk to this guy. So there and then my buddy actually wrote a book on it. That's how I actually got it. I actually heard about it somewhere else and then this dude that I know here actually wrote a book on it and he sells those policies. Well, what these guys do like I've seen other their people do is like, it's the basis of their sort of wealth pyramid, literally. yeah, when you start with that, and then they also go into like alternative investments and tax strategic investments. one of the things that he said on the call was like, yeah, you he's like, if you're, oh, the other thing he said in Joe's thing was, hey, if you're someone that's got like an eminent, um, crazy use, whatever. It was basically like, if you're someone that's going to be selling your business and you're going to have a huge influx of cash, he's like, you need, you need to have a plan before that happens, right? need to be, you need to have your tax strategy laid out so that you're not paying 40%.
00:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not paying this huge cap gains. What Dexter would tell you is instead of a tax planner or taxpayer or accountant at all, what you would want is a wealth manager.
00:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that's what these guys are.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they know the laws even better.
00:17:06 - Dan’s iPhone
So what he's saying is like, hey, we have like a whole suite, right, that we have lawyers, have tax people, we have the accountants, we have the investors, and we're all sort of following the same program, and we all investment opportunities, and then they also will help you sort of go through one, so like my example is like, what if I want to buy multiplex?
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, I don't know about that.
00:17:40 - Dan’s iPhone
So yeah, oh yeah, no, we can bring it to you can bring it to us, bring it to bring it to the group or whatever, bring it to this mastermind, whatever the hell you want to call it. And then we could walk you through how to do the deal, like they're not in on the deal, but they tell you what to look for and what to, you know, negotiate about. Okay, yeah, that's exactly.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what I want but he's like we don't help you find the deal but he's like we do find other deals that you can invest in or not but one of his things was like he's saying that you invest in energy you invest in oil and that these create these huge tax offsets but he's like what do you think you're paying tax right now I said I honestly don't know like it's got to be 40% he's like I could probably cut so sorry I was just thinking because Seth is big on trusts and he's like been studying this for years and like I am wanting to have conversations about it but so that I can understand it better because it's a scary kind of thing but basically and I just out of curiosity you might want to talk to him I don't I don't know how rebellious you want to be I already helped up
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone
That's my problem is that like the parts that make sense to me. I've executed right. So it made sense to me years ago have a solo 401k. I don't know why I set it up. And then when I got with Rob, she was like, how did you do this? It's like, how did you even know to do this and how did you do it? And then she's like, is this real? got as far as I know and it's real. And she took it over. And that was the right thing right now. It's this vehicle that I use. And then I got like, I have this one insurance policy with Denise and I, this was the dude that does the whole life. Like, I wasn't ready to commit the whole life at the time because I did. I mean, I understood it, but I was like, I don't think I could do that. I could definitely do it now. I don't think I was like financially really where I thought I could do it and not put myself in position where it might come back to bite me in the , but although I sort of think that isn't actually real thing. knew we were going to move, right? So I was like, I might need money for the house. I can't have money tied up in anything, so whatever. So I didn't do it then. But what I did do then was he had this other life-in-term thing. It's like a second to die policy. And it's basically like, essentially once all's been done, it's like the if I die or Denise dies, one of us dies, the other one gets like $3 million, something like that. And so he was like, this is how the policy works. And I told it to Ronda and Ronda was like, there's no way. There's no way it works like that. She's like, I need to meet with this guy. And we met with him. We went through the numbers and Ronda was like, holy , it does work the way. She's like, what the? And she's like, yeah, you could do that. I got the trust. So I set that up first. I think I got that. But then, What is this? His name is David Dark Angelou. He was like a friend of a friend.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I heard that name before.
00:21:09 - Dan’s iPhone
He used to work with Tony Roberts bunch.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way back in the Roberts or Robins.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Robins, sorry. He's like he's never really been in the Internet marketing world.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I know I've seen that face too. long time ago. Oh, not that dude. Okay. Go away.
00:21:31 - Dan’s iPhone
So he was like someone that I met years ago and like he actually recently hit me up. was actually going to hit him up about this whole life thing because I know that he knows that game. Right. He knows where to find the policies and yada yada. So when I talked to this other dude, I was like, well, hey, don't have to buy the policy through us. So they're like, we just help you. Oh, dude. Sorry.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's try to get it. Subscribe to him so I don't forget.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone
They just show you like all the strategies and then they have like investment opportunities. Your paying for access is basically what it blows down to, access to people that are doing the same thing. he's like, look, you'll be in the room with people that have $100 million, just straight up just so you know, but I could show up with the whole life policy of, yeah, you don't have to buy it through us. Okay. I thought it was interesting and it's like, okay, so your base thing is not the thing that you're making money on, like the thing that you're telling everyone to do first. He could make money on it, but he's like, no, you can, you're ready to trust that up, would just make sure you can just go through the checklist and make sure it's set up the way it should be. Okay.
00:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, all this stuff fascinates me and I think that my guy is finally going to be done with crap in a few months, I don't know, I really hope so, because 10 years is a long time. Yeah, it is. It would break most people or they would move out of the country or just be thrown in prison because they tie your hand so bad you do something and that's the consequence, which is why I'm actually interested in having these conversations with Seth about trust and stuff, even though I'm sure he already knows a lot of that but doesn't want to talk about it because they just scared the life out of you. Anyway, um, lands down.
00:23:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay, so, so, anyway, I'm to talk to Rhonda about that. And I did talk to, I did talk to this, this Dave person about it. So like, you can bring, I was like, so I could talk to you about like these things and I'm considering things like, yeah, and I think I gave them that as an example. And I go right. I could like, oh, the other thing I asked them because I actually weirdly or not, right. for this dude, shut up. I started looking into whole life again on my own. I was like, can you everything I looked at? Like, you couldn't pre-fund it. And so I asked him, I said, can you pre-fund one of these? He's like, you can. He's like, you just got to, it is possible. You can do it. It's like, you just got to make sure that that's the setup that you get yourself. then you can pre-fund it. Because what I was reading was like, you have to fund it for three years before you can actually then take a loan against it. So in my version of the world, I would fund it. And then if I do the Lansdown thing, I borrow the money from myself, which is the whole point of doing that . And then use that to buy Lansdown. Then I pay the interest on Lansdown with the money that I'm making from Lansdown. So I make a little less. Whatever. And then he's like, again, you just pay back at any time, right? not like a real loan. then, of course, that's where you use to like buy your kids. Give your kids a loan for their house. Oh, like if you have enough money there, it's like, okay, cool.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's still on the table. Let's see. I'm looking at last week or actually probably the last couple of weeks with mom course development or just stack or offer or anything.
00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone
So Sean is evaluating circle as the community and it sounds like it sounds like it's so funny. He's like, I don't think this is going to work. It would be great if it did this. So he's doing this all via text and he's basically just texting himself. like he's texting questions to the group. And then in the course of like nine texts, he figured out he convinced himself the circle was the right solution.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was I glad you worked that out with yourself.
00:26:17 - Dan’s iPhone
But he's sold on it now. He's like, Oh, course, this is what I was saying the whole time. So we got to get that set up. It's set up. It's on the trial, whatever, but we got to get it set up. So that's now going to officially be the thing. Then that's where the course would live. So now we got to figure out I got Greg like finished the cover today. And then I just sent him a message. was like, Hey, I can either just drip. He did the cover in the first worksheet. I said, I can either drip the worksheets on you one in a row, one in time, or I can dump them all on you like in a priority order. Let me know. but you prefer. So based on his answer, I will do whatever he says, my plan is just to go, because he did literally did the first one on the book. So then we'll do the second one, the third one, fourth one, I think there's like nine to 12 or the other. So we'll get all those done, and then the book's done, and then I had sent Eric and Abhishek, those guys, the book funnel, all I was like, we can build this on new bases, right? they're like, yep. Then I sort of told Maria, hey, don't be surprised if I can tell you women a project here in the near future center. I don't think I sent her anything though. just emailed her back for me, but she told me.
00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got her. She's getting big co-honies now. She put out a $15,000 offer and a done for you instead of the $2,000 stuff, and she's just feeling good. and she's got people who are would be a good fit for that.
00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone
So then the course that we would have to make is the do it like just walking them through like how to do all the ads and stuff. So we got to sort of map that out because it's like I guess we'll just we'll do it like we'll make the email portion but then put it in your CRM and then the CRM we're going to show on the screen is ours. It's family but it's like you would just send her in your CRM whatever it is. I do mail chimping like in whatever is. And then I was going to hit up the super res guys I was thinking about that and I'm like I was just probably so I was going to hit them up and be like hey let's do like a hybrid hybrid non-commercial model. So it would be I pay you to customize it. I get to call it fan flowy. I am not going to sell it. Right, so that eliminates me competing with you not only am I not going to sell it I'm only going to allow people that have already become a lead for me to get access to it So it's not even good like you won't even be able to go download it from the site Right, so it's like it's sort of behind It's gated to whatever degree And then I'll pay you The customization fee and then I'll pay you a rip Like a quarterly rip on We're either a flat monthly licensing fee. I have no idea how many people are going to download this, right? So that's probably the best course of action like hey, you're making a Thousand bucks a month. I'll pay you 200 Let's pay you 200 a month to have to as a license fee and then we can sort of work out Another deal after that, but also I will I will helping market super-us. If you really think it's that great, I'll help you market it, but you have to cut me in on super-us.
00:30:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I vacillate instantaneously between their short-sidedness, but also the fact that, like, maybe reality is a little bit...
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, I get it. It's big idea to see us, right? It's like they're so married to this thing. It's like... And then I'm not risking anything, right? It's like the only risk I'm taking is that they'll cut me out, but then I'll lock them into like a five-year deal. Like I want a five-year deal that you cannot back out of, and it will be very similar to what we did with like exam matrix when we got, we licensed their software and rebranded it, but we did sell it. And then... And we had a five-year deal that they were locked in. when they sold it, that contract went with them. when that guy sold it, that contract went with them until the final buyer was starting to be an addict and started re-interpreting the contract. And we were already on the path of building our own software in the background. And then lo and behold, when our contract ends, we had our own software.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oops. I feel like y'all didn't get left again at the same time. I slept terribly last night.
00:31:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm not sure if I was sleeping anymore.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought I like, oh. I stopped wearing my Applewats and my Aurorang because I sleep better without them. But I also got a lot of data for a long time. So I know, you know, got my baselines really good. But I also ate garbage yesterday.
00:31:56 - Dan’s iPhone
So there was that.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed. that it was a girl thing. was like, I'm eating cake and Mexican.
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone
And cake.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. let me go through this. So one of the things that we're talking about was defining who should I have a community because they're not for everyone. Like, how big should your following be? What's the criteria? there's, I think I already said following size, that kind of thing. Have you guys talked about that at all?
00:32:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Uh, no. I don't think that came up on the call like it was supposed to.
00:32:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So I'm going to do this and say, oh, What would you call that call that a mom call or?
00:33:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes, Monday.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Monday what?
00:33:12 - Dan’s iPhone
Mom.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:33:14 - Dan’s iPhone
I think it says rent. mean, I think the meeting is like to rent the table.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, actually said that earlier to her. Oh, fan flowy call log fan flowy call. Dan wants to discuss nine thirty nine sixteen seven twenty nine. I don't want to. I don't to a document making brand new change and I don't even have to edit access anyway so I'll put that in there um I'll just mark bring a list of stuff stuck on the call because he clearly has one where does it live I never got that you just get that yeah where does where does that how does that happen the google doc okay um what are you yesterday yes she said that that it that must be the fan flowy call-up google doc or something else huh yeah that's it so it's not I thought it was a transfer to my what what transfer why are you some of the transfer I guess that's what's called I'm no idea oh yeah what are minutes of you maybe more like it let's see That's interesting. Beta testers for the seating planner.
00:35:17 - Dan’s iPhone
How that going? What am I Google answer? I went through my email and I found every Google ads rep that's ever reached out to me. He's like, I guess they just cycled her and give you a new one every quarter. I emailed all of them. Okay. And the oldest one, which is weird. So I just got a new one like after this started. So I think I got a new one on like Tuesday, randomly emailed her, emailed the one back to me yesterday. And we're like, are you still having this problem? And I just emailed them like, yes, still having this problem. They're like, oh, because they're like, if you're in the problem, I can escalate it. It's pretty run a mic. So hopefully it'll get escalated and solved. But I'm still stuck. Like, I cannot get ads to run on these accounts that have this payment or a file issue. Oh, and also, I don't want to run this on Mark's card, even though Mark's like, oh, you can put on my card. No, I can't, because it's mine. This is not yours, Mark. This is mine.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can't get beta testers, because you need to run ads? OK. OK.
00:36:54 - Dan’s iPhone
It can lead to your car. The leads will lead to beta. to test versus the thought yeah no I got that um yeah no it's just the thought now we're gonna breathe it oh you're red is great let's see what is the like status of that project I did one and I sent it to Sean and was like hey can you peruse this and see us right I don't know if he's like that yet I'm pretty sure I'm right um and I'm doing the other one but the other one the chat TPT was nowhere near successful with the second round I don't know why because it's the language is a little more nuanced than whatever so when it categorizes a bunch of stuff they're all wrong but a lot. I have to manually go through and like recategorize them and there's just taking forever. So I'm doing chunks. And then, of course, I screwed up and resorted the sheet and then lost my place and I couldn't resort it back to where it was. And I was like, oh, great. So I didn't start over, but I'm probably doing duplicative work because I don't recognize stuff that I had already done. But whatever, just don't sort it again.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You cut out for a minute. So I know. I think I got that just a minute.
00:38:38 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm doing a second one. So the first one worked out.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did a second one. You know, I have, I'm wondering sometimes now because chat GPT like about two and a half months ago, maybe three months ago now, probably two and a And I'm wondering if like. like if that's well obviously I think something actually happens because I used it too many times for that logic to make any sense for it to like be less logical and it is less logical so there are two kinds of things that I think about is it is it a I don't know like I wonder if it's setting it up so that we are wowed by the next version so much because it's so much better than this version because they backtracked it or if I don't know like throttling access and we're not really getting that for like I don't know what it is with something change and it is not as good right it's not precise but just stupid people started using it with us and therefore they make it dumber yeah but I will send you to your windows user what your windows user oh no you're windows can Good or so or no? No, I haven't.
00:40:02 - Dan’s iPhone
I use I have I've had both a parallel Huh? Do you parallels? Can you run windows on Mac?
00:40:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I don't I mean I don't have it set up like that What is parallels?
00:40:16 - Dan’s iPhone
It's not like it's so later. Yeah So Nvidia has their own gpt And it's like we started using the yesterday, so I won't send it to you unless it's good But it's it's called like Something like chart RX, so it's like specifically for dealing with data So I gave I had Eric install parallels and that yesterday and then he uploaded like all of Mark's blog posts and we gave it 40,000 records and Now I want to query that data set and say Tell me every city California city that is mentioned in these 40,000 posts, and then see how it does. And then I because I really just need the city names, and I'm like, how the hell am I going to get these across 40,000 posts?
00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:12 - Dan’s iPhone
And then see how it does, and then be like, all right, now tell me the frequency of those cities, then be like, Hey, me what counties are mentioned. But I guess first, I don't know if have to teach it first, like, Hey, here are all the California cities and counties, that's easy to get. Well, we're going to see, but then it's also like, we're going to feed it the categories that SEO people created. And we're going to say, All right, anywhere. It's actually hard to do this. But what I wanted to do at the end is spit back out the CSV, and then add a column for categories, and then give it like, if there's a city make that a category, if there's a county make down a category, and then I'll prioritize the category. or the blog post category is for lack of a better term. And then I'd say if any of the blog post categories exist, you're allowed to add two. I don't want any more than four categories for any post. So you can add two by priority. if hit and run were the number one priority and hit and run was there, you'd use hit and run. And then whatever, right? And see if it can do that because we need, I need four categories applied to every blog post across 40,000 posts. All right. I'd like doing that manually. So let's see. But chat TPT borked, I thought I could even read the sheet.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm interested to see. I mean, so is NVIDIA stuff using OpenAI?
00:42:54 - Dan’s iPhone
I actually don't know. I just stumbled on it. Just one of those weird random things, like an all of a sudden. two days later, I'm like, oh, we can do this. It's like, I wasn't looking for it. I don't know why it came into my purview, my view, well, whatever. There's another one too. There's one called, I don't think it's gonna be good for this, it's called base.ai. And it allows you to launch your own serverless agents, I think, is, I thinking that might be for something else. Then my buddy is like all into like just building your own rag environment, like on your computer and just running into LLM locally.
00:43:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rag environment?
00:43:44 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I forget what it stands for, but that's the thing. you set up a rag, and we're going to there.
00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm- It's generation.
00:43:53 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm not going down that road at all.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I actually wanted to have like You can. Good night. server but I don't the thing is it's not like a there's two ways to look at it in one way it's not a great use of time because it's tedious and long there's a huge learning curve it'll take a while but on the other end of it the what we know about it and and what it and this goes back to kind of my whole generalist approach to business anyway is that my speed of implementation with whatever comes out will be so much faster and more leverage because I will have an internal understanding of how it works and also when it comes down to like cost and customization being able to have something on a server level and then also privacy to have your own server like and I think that that's going to be really important and I think that anyone I think that at that kind of privacy and having our own servers is going to be more commonplace than it's ever been before because of that's the biggest thing right now right is having everybody's data accessed all the time and how that's used. Did you see there was a there's these kids from Harvard that made and they connected their meta glasses to chat GBT and they built a program that would scan faces of people they are looking at and be able to pull up their name address phone number and all that kind of identification of course yeah I mean we knew that going to happen soon but that is already here like that's the thing and that's what we know about.
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone
Did you see Elon's robot that they just put out yesterday? Duke, people having a conversation with it. It's frightening. It's frightening. Like, oh my God, it sounds like a person. Like, it's way beyond what I thought it would be. oh, okay. And he's like, this is gonna be the best song product we ever make. Like, okay. I mean, we can it. I'm full on like, Rhonda by Tesla because they are not a car company. Period.
00:46:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not a car company. No, van.
00:46:33 - Dan’s iPhone
I just see Robo van. Have you seen that? Oh, yeah. think you're up.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. The truck's getting rocks.
00:46:41 - Dan’s iPhone
The taxi. Yeah, it was a taxi to van and the robot or the piece of the rolled out yesterday.
00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is crazy how fast, like our sci-fi movies are coming. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the thing about pacing, though. is it's always been faster than well it's not always been faster like but but it is now faster than people think it is but but the the rate of increase is way faster than anybody thinks it's going to be yeah because of the compounding effect and all the brains working not necessarily together but they are all being able to pull from other people's learning curves and technology like there's so much access to a hive via the internet but also the worldwide networks of people who know people that's never existed before like it does now no no and my buddy is always like he thinks everyone should have their own like personal AI that's like really built around their data set that's sort of like what you were saying a minute ago and I ever
00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Every day, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's, I could see where that would be helpful. And especially if you could have it sort of use your local data set and then also be tapping into the LLM, right? it's like, oh, and maybe you prioritize like I want, you know, consider this data source first and then if there's something missing, then go out.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and the, anybody that understands if this, then that logic will do really well because it's conditional logic that those things need to go with, right? If this does not, and if not this, then this, that type of thing. And there are a lot of brains that don't do that. There are a lot of that do, but percentage wise, most of them don't. so the opportunity for all these micro markets around AI exists and the, and I'm not had this thought before, but thinking about it now, that's where competition will still be is because it's the same way. Basically, it'll be like the same reason why one particular flavor, one person's particular flavor of voice would draw them to their business coaching over, let's say, Tony Robbins or some other big corporate mega name, right? would be the same reason somebody would buy that lower level AI because whatever, just that whole kind of nuance of personal connection and voice match and things like that. Anyway, interesting or fascinating, but to the point of the server, like I have these machines, but none of them are fast enough and I want to get it, but it's been so long since I've built a machine and know the components and I'd have to upgrade the motherboard and I'm like, oh, do I really want to do this? I wish I could just get one of my kids, like, train No, but there you've got their own interest and they're not here. So like here like in that interest. Anyway, oh, speaking of kids, how's Abel and doing?
00:50:11 - Dan’s iPhone
You text here and there text to her today.
00:50:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She respond when I saw she read it. And yeah, somebody's going to teach her how to turn that off.
00:50:24 - Dan’s iPhone
I thought she did. I think she did in our group chat, but she didn't turn it off and but yeah, well, it's positive.
00:50:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She doesn't turn it off. Probably a good thing. She's adjusting. Well, she doesn't, but it's hard.
00:50:41 - Dan’s iPhone
How's Denise?
00:50:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine.
00:50:44 - Dan’s iPhone
She's just, which Mary was the one like Mary was just getting. You know, your kids self diagnosed themselves with mental problems. Yes. What is up with that? Like, I don't understand this generation.
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no. Oh, it's not just the generation, but it's the access that they have. So it's been a phenomenon in medical students since the beginning, where if they read about symptoms, then they can add, yeah, yeah, in fact, in my classes every year, they warn us like, don't think you have this just because you read it, because that's what everybody does and don't freak out. Oh, and yeah, so it's just that they've got so much access to this information that it happens. They see themselves in this thing. And what they don't realize is the nuance of it and the overlap and all these other conditions again, if this than that type of thing, but there's this also need to feel like we're seen and understood or to give meaning or logic to emotions that we have. And so when you find a label that seems like it fits, now you've feel like you have some understanding. And so that's the logic behind it, like, oh, okay, I understand this now. And also, I'm not accountable. not my fault.
00:52:12 - Dan’s iPhone
So she's going through this series of self-diagnoses. And it's like she's literally trying to find one that we'll ascend to. And then because then the natural step after that is to go talk to your therapist. And we're like, okay, but first she had ADD. And I'm like, you do not have ADD. hate to break it to you, but like, you're born with that. And it would have shown up way before 16 and PS.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nothing, girls.
00:52:48 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, she doesn't have it. Like there's nothing ADD about you at all, at all. But it's like you can sit there and draw for hours on end. literally hours. I'm like, 80 people cannot do that. then she was like, and she's like, well, I don't have the HD part. I'm like, well, there you go. Now you're reading definitely too much. Then that turned into, then she started saying, I can't sit still. going crazy. can't sit still. Like, yeah, no. Okay. You literally can't sit still. You don't say you can't sit still. It's like you'd be bouncing around the river together. Then it was stress. Okay, well, what's stressing you out? And then she liked that one. And now she's sad all the time, mostly.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, yeah.
00:53:43 - Dan’s iPhone
And I'm like, what are you doing? So then she keeps, she won't say it to me because, you know, I'll be like, try to solve it. And then with Denise, Denise is like, well, I could find like a Catholic counselor. And why does that have to be Catholic? Why does it have not have to be? it's like, do you want a counselor or not? So now it's going to be a specific one, which one? Which one should it be?
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you know so much.
00:54:09 - Dan’s iPhone
So, yeah.
00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's hard.
00:54:13 - Dan’s iPhone
It was homeschooling. At some point, she wanted to be homeschooled and that went away. It's like, okay.
00:54:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I had one that she got her GED last year and, but she was, talk a class through everything, math, science, all that stuff. Then you get to high school and a lot of the teachers just are spazs. They're not even good at what they do. Sometimes they're dumber than my girls. They're poor leaders. It gets really frustrating. And then you're dealing with all these other students that have poor parenting, poor hygiene, not that intelligent. Like, it's just such a, you nothing out. in the world is like high school and it's it's rough while everybody's got volatile hormones and their brains are going through all these different changes their emotions they're not getting enough sleep and school starts super early even though their circadian rhythms are jacked up at this time it's fun it's lots of fun yeah yeah um okay let me so uh so you can't run any ads still at all is that what you're I cannot run ads in four accounts but the other ones that have the same payment profile well perfectly fine but how many are those oh i don't know like it's there you know there's a bunch of old accounts that i don't even use anymore but um so probably like three maybe and i don't want to
00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I them because I'm like, I don't want to mess with those accounts and I don't want to mess with, you know, these are none of these are connected to another 71, luckily. And they're, you know, my opinion profile isn't connected to marks. So I was like, I don't want to, I don't know why this is happening. don't understand why it's happening. My account is approved and it has been for years. like, something's off somewhere. Maybe it was because I I don't know why. don't know why. I think it's associated with one and they're applying it to the other is what I think is going on. Yeah.
00:56:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you're like, sorry.
00:56:40 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I just don't know what's going on.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, um, so you were saying like last week or Monday, I think you said you got that new ad rep and you sent them a bunch of stuff, but then you're like, they keep changing. So is, do you have somebody working on it for you?
00:56:59 - Dan’s iPhone
Supposedly right now. It's more deep the ad rip from six months ago. That's the only one that responded. No one else is responding. I'm sure it'll go into Google speed, which is not found.
00:57:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. This is the the the the the time of it's not what you know but who you know kind of thing.
00:57:27 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. That's why I jumped into my emails. was like, well, like they contacted me.
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can't like them.
00:57:34 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. I just think it's hilarious that the one that just got assigned to me and specifically is assigned to D&D as a respondent.
00:57:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we found out that so my guy had they got shut down and he went through all of his contacts to find an old connection that I get like you out like had or maybe like you I don't remember how nothing to do with that particular one but anyway Well, what somebody told him who shouldn't have said anything was that it it appeared to be competitor causing problems That got them shut down that's the thing so like Google Amazon and Facebook They own the majority of the media space and we're in election time where the space is like More valuable and I don't know what the overlap is like because there's only So much ad space on any particular thing and does that like does not related info Take up space like is that a reason I don't know but competitors for sure like Amazon like there That's this whole thing and That's even more reason why the who we know like you have lots of conversations with people Knowing who can help you on any of the the Media platforms cuz cuz all it would take would be for somebody Who competes with another 71? to get you guys shut down like playing a dirty game that's totally possible and And Like what do you do after that? They you're so much And that's to also why diversifying traffic sources is going to be so important diversifying and then Maintaining the most powerful relationships you can where it comes to The the main media sources, which is almost impossible, but it doesn't mean But and you know what happens synergistically Divinely universally whatever, you set that intention and things become more possible. that's, that's the dirty game that we are all at risk of is that if we, if the business is dependent upon ads from one of those big three where you can get shut down for anything, you don't know what it is, they won't tell you, you can't get a hold of a real person. There's no rhyme or reason or logic behind it.
01:00:28 - Dan’s iPhone
Like if that's the bread and butter of your business, you're screwed.
01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Anyway, lovely, colorful thoughts.
01:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
having this week. Holy , like you could just destroy a huge company. I will, I guess it's not really huge like when you think about it, but it's not but still there's like a few families that are dependent upon it. I guess it's not really huge. It is to the average person who's like millions of dollars.
01:00:58 - Dan’s iPhone
Wow, you know, when they're
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that these platforms have been, yeah, like with all the crap that we've gone through with Wolfer for on brain tree, like brain tree doesn't give a about the account.
01:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, give a . They're the that they've essentially like crippled.
01:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They would have been out of business. We didn't switch the stride.
01:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. It's taken weeks and get it's still not done. It's unreal. And then brain trees shut down, reset you, just shut them down. And I was like, really? Locked up their money, shut them down, and said it was because they were selling supplements. Where? Where are there supplements for sale on this site? And then there's, and it's our decision is final.
01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't bother writing back.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone
Wow. Your decision is based on nothing. It's final. Okay, sounds great.
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so always having another option and back door, but like, how do you do that? How do you, like, how do you have a secondary option that's even comparable to GMB?
01:02:07 - Dan’s iPhone
You don't, you don't.
01:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. Yeah.
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone
But, but I think, but I mean, I mean, problem there is that, but like, their entire business, like what, that's like with Mark three years ago, Mark last monkey three years ago, he was up .
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's great. Yeah.
01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone
Not so much.
01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It made me think about, though, the strategy between car accident claim center is like, what if you have two and you'd have to run them on completely different accounts, probably using a VPN, completely different IPs, completely different business names, like, is all the separation you could possibly have. And one is branded traffic and one is non branded traffic, just in case, and maybe to help mitigate, doesn't mean that they won't be you're out and shut you down, but um.
01:03:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, you wouldn't want to mix, especially the other one works for both work. You want them separated. That's why I'm gonna, I want to copy the valiant thing through a different domain. So it's like, oh, I'm gonna use similar domain, but it's different.
01:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's the. Anyway, that's that's the thing that we have to be thinking about is what is what is the. It's not the variable, but but what diversity can we create even within the environment as a a backdoor, kind of not a backdoor option, but just a backup option that maybe isn't as powerful, but still. And honestly, maybe it is a data on a traffic plan. Like you have kind of like this parallel business that looks like the whole point of it is, you know, generating traffic for multiple businesses and you're selling leads, but really it's a if everything hits the fan I'm funneling all those leads to my own business. I don't know You don't want to fund your competitors, but Maybe sell the data to somebody who's not competing But still interested in relative data. I Don't know what that looks like, but either way, I feel like that's the chess move is to Know that traffic can get shut down. And so how do you have a backup traffic source on the same platform? That could be redirected to an existing business if it got shut down and maybe it's not the same amount of volume, but it keeps you from like going from Everything to zero and maybe you only lose like 50% of it or something While you work it out Yeah, I mean that's extremely difficult to do on google for sure Um, that's like Is it this this business was?
01:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that dependent on that one source.
01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. It was the thing that blew it up.
01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. And it's also the thing that blew it up in both directions.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But it's because of the nature of the business that it's the kind of thing that people go and get local reviews. So, and they were all tied to this one account. So it's definitely a learning lesson. Um, but it, but it, the growth was explosive and fast. And so was a shutdown, although, but it did get turned back on, but it was, it was crazy. Um, this whole thing again, back to pace of the evolution. It's, it's hard to, you have to be consciously thinking about the pace and the potential change and the potential destruction at all times to be able to be even remotely prepared for things happening because apathy. for even like a month or a few months could put you in a situation where something happened and like you took your eye off the ball and that the ball is your building up against this platform yes and you don't control any of it right totally yeah anyway all right well sir that's Friday huh oh how was how was mom time yesterday it was good i mean she's definitely like she was like who's your who's your sister who who's your person i go who's my person i know you have a secretary i go no who helps you i go stacy i'm going to reach out to stacy and tell her to put bomb lunch once a month in your calendar i said she'll do it i'm going to i'm going to reach out to her i don't know she really will she might we'll see um so she clearly wants that and then we went and visited my
01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone
dad and he is oh man he is so much worse i was like he didn't remember anybody like any any of other than like the immediate family like he thought his brother was dead his only brother that's alive he thought he was dead and then he couldn't he didn't know my cousin sadly my cousin just passed away like last week and he didn't know who she was who's kid michelle who's michelle your brother's daughter what brother Paul Paul Paul has a daughter like Paul has two daughters he does i don't remember that but that was the interesting thing is he kept saying i don't remember that i don't remember that then he didn't remember he didn't remember his other brother's son who has the same name i was like are you talking about Jackie and you write so the That's Jack and the son's Jackie and what are you talking about Jackie? Who's Jackie? I'm like, Jack's son. I don't remember that. Is Jack have kids? Other kids were like, no. he goes, is he the oldest? And we're like, no. Like the fourth. And so I like, oh boy. And then he didn't like, didn't remember Lisa. He thought Lisa had a job somewhere. I don't know where he thought she worked, but he didn't remember that. He thought that my brother's garage, where he lived, was not remodeled. He's like, I want to go finish that.
01:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to go.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I think we should build that out. We're like, it's filled out. He's like, no, no, I mean, like, put up insulation, put in wallboard. No, dad, that's all we're done. They put in wallboard? Who? We're like, okay. So, and then when we left, my mom's like, he is so much worse than the last time I was here. I was like, really? She goes, yeah, it's a. A lot of work seems to get open, which I thought.
01:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, this seems worse. Does your mom have, like, good friends?
01:09:10 - Dan’s iPhone
No, doesn't. Like, she did. The woman across the street, they were, like, besties. then she passed away. So there's one. And then her nephew moved in. He just moved out because he couldn't afford to live in California anymore. So that was dated. So David's gone. So all she's got is my brother. And then my brother's hilarious, right? she got that operation. So like, they're living together, which is going to be a lot. So she told me, I got a lot of my brother for this. So she'll come out and start talking to him, and he'll just look at her and go, Mom, it's quiet time right now. And then I go, what do you do? She goes, I go back into my room, sick. I'm like, that's a very nice way of putting it. She's like, no, I respect it like he's, you know, he's come. been working all day. You got to be on it.
01:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, she's a mom, so she probably gets that, but.
01:10:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I mean, she's very much still with it, right? she's still very sharp, and it's like, OK, yeah, she can't drive, right? So she just lost that. And then, you know, she does, the Ubers are so expensive. And then she's been trying to find an alternative to Uber. then they're all ludicrous. It's like, there's this other service. It's a minimum $150. It's three hours, minimum three hours, $150. And then they're a nurse. And she's like, I don't need a nurse. I just need like a sidekick. But how would you even like provide a service like that, right? have to do background check on these people, like, you know. So yeah, how much?
01:10:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is she like interested in retirement community at all?
01:10:57 - Dan’s iPhone
No. Well, then another. money, right? All the money is going to my debt. Yesterday, she literally said this. She was like, we'd all be better off if I died. And I was like, that's where you're at. And she's like, well, it would just make things easier. And she's like, you know, then he'd get all the money, and then he'd get even more money because I passed away. And she's like, this is eventually going to like, I'm eventually going to run out of money. And I like, well, do you don't have to worry about it until that happens. No, I don't think that's the problem. Like, it's not where she's living.
01:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, how do you?
01:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, love me. You're gonna be thinking about it right now. It's like, kind of be some sort of thing network thing that you can tap into where they come pick you up. Like, it's gonna be some sort of group affair. Yeah.
01:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, if you look at longevity, the people that live the the longest longest are the people.
01:12:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that live in multi-generational houses and have basically like open door policies and people visit each other a lot and she's like super at that because the joke was we should just get you in a joining room here she's like I'm not I'm not moving into a place like this and I think she just means in general like she doesn't want to live but she would literally arrive because she everybody loves her and she everyone times she was she's the one that like it's like she has an invisible couch that she takes around and they lay down on it and just spill their guns she would you'd go into the store to get like a loaf of bread you know pick a milk and she'd come out with like someone's life story I'm like oh my god you were only in there what is that making it be like take care of other people for a little bit each week or could you do this just for three months or six
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
once or whatever and frame it like she's there to help other people which would be true because what she did she was a nurse that was right but but that's what I'm saying but like maybe she needs it to be positioned as this is a thing that you need to go do for other people could you go do this for other people for a little while and just because like they're lonely they need help and they don't have anybody who will do it because everybody's busy and up in their own world but and then maybe she just finds what she needs because we all especially women like men do too many projects that are things and women need projects that are people and yeah so the other thing she can't do right now is because of this recovery from the surgery right so right now it's literally just about like she just needs interaction outside of my brother i think she's but she can't get it because she's homebound really
01:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Come on, better turn. Luckily, she's got the dog. The dog does help. They never had a dog. We never had a dog run up. She loves this dog. The dog's the best, Aw.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Man, I can't turn off mom mode, but I also can't turn off daughter mode and sister mode and all that other stuff. And it just breaks my heart, like, how much loneliness is in the world when there's like, but everybody's not everybody's lonely. But like, so many people are lonely. I'm like, you know, you guys could solve that if you would just, like, spend time with each other. Right. anyway, okay, I will be quiet.
01:14:38 - Dan’s iPhone
I will let you go.
01:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wait, I don't know if we're talking to Mark Monday. I will check on that, because he is on vacation. But I know how he is. He pretty much doesn't have our council air calls. I will check. And then I will let you know if there's any change. Otherwise, we will soon. I will talk to you Monday.

Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.
00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone
There's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.
00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Are you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?
00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.
00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

Hi.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you, Fuji?
00:00:03 - Michael F
Good. Well, I'm so sorry I missed Monday.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. It happened like that stuff happened, Mom. It's a second. Sorry. this is why I didn't want you in here in the first place, you know? Yeah, it could be anything though.
00:00:32 - Michael F
like to bark at the deer all the time.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They tag with the deer, which is hilarious. They'll chase each other up and down the fence. All right, so let's start with reports, just first your kind of verbal report of how things have gone for you this week.
00:01:00 - Michael F
I started working again so like yesterday and today I did full days of work well totally full but so I usually help with the baby until like one or something like that and then Esther takes over the rest of the evening and then I go actually we have an extra room so I go sleep in our office and then I get up whatever 745 whatever it is and then 730 and then go to work so yeah I'm thankful for the uninterrupted sleep so it's nice that Esther but yeah it's tough on Esther like she was super tired yesterday and super tired today just because I'm not helping her so it takes her like an extra you know 15 minutes to feed instead of gain sleep yeah just baby things baby things that's gonna be it so you have some assignments
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to them?
00:02:01 - Michael F
Yeah, they lose it and then make a better, think, better chart for the sleeve, I think.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we also talked about finishing the business spreadsheet that the time tracker, we talked about tracking time, but we're not going to start that yet, right? Because I think we said we start, I think I asked you to decide when you wanted to start because we're not really, things will normal out more once you get in September when you get your housekeeper, I guess, but she's kind of the assistant also.
00:02:46 - Michael F
Yeah, I think that's a little more reasonable.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, going to wait until then. And how does you do on, I see the stuff that you have in the timesheet homework, but not nothing in step two, just the step one. And talk about that in a minute. talk about that in a We talked about you getting some information from the, or maybe this was the week before now, because sometimes things run together, but from the neighbors about the cleaner. Oh, yeah.
00:03:44 - Michael F
Yeah, we interviewed her. Doesn't really like the cooking, because we were thinking we could use her as a cook to meal prep for us, but the neighbor was like, she doesn't. She can cook in a pinch, but wouldn't have her as that final. She's very meticulous, like she's kind of like loves keeping things clean, so that's nice. So hopefully her and Esther will see eye to eye. And then, yeah, overall, I think the neighbor just says she's just very good with the kids. The kids love her. And, you know, she's not a teaching nanny where the kids are going to come out being like, you know, readers or stuff, she's more of just a companion. She's always talking to them in Spanish. She's just talking, talking to them. And she says both of the kids are like super, and they're both introverted. And she's like, yeah, both of my kids are just like, love talking. They talk in Spanish. And she thinks a big part of that was the, Dolores, the housekeeper, because she's just talking to them, not on her phone or anything like that. So, yeah, we feel pretty good about Something happens in employment.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it just helps you simplify the steps to hire her formally as an employee and so we talked a little bit about the structure of how you would hire her like whether or not you would make that a separate LLC with Esther or like an escort for paying wages. Did you give that any more thought for structure?
00:05:26 - Michael F
No.
00:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that anything that you still want to think about?
00:05:30 - Michael F
You've got some time so. Yeah, you know I'll actually that would just the easiest things I just asked my accountant. I'm like hey can we should we can we hire this person okay and then I think that'll take some yeah I'll just shoot a quick email to my accountant that'll take care of that issue. He says yes then we'll hire her under one of the companies. He says it doesn't really matter then I'll just do this pop-ins payroll thing and and set up. I don't think I'm for that. You asked them by any chance that they use nanny cams. No, I didn't. Sorry, I was going to do that now, but didn't.
00:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want a reminder to think about that or not big deal?
00:06:22 - Michael F
I think let me talk that over with Esther. think that's a good thing. Yeah, maybe a reminder to talk that with Esther. She's been, yeah, because she hasn't had my help at night. She's been a little more sleepy and jumpy. So I haven't really talked to her the last few days about anything serious, more just kind of what do you need? What food do you need by your bed? can I help you with? But I think hopefully tonight I'll be able to help out obviously tomorrow. So I think she'll feel better after she gets. I have no idea how she slept last night. She hasn't texted me all day, so she might be just dead today again.
00:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe they all got some naps together.
00:07:10 - Michael F
Yeah, we bought a new bassinet because she was just dying. She wouldn't sleep in our other bassinet, so we're trying to win that like rocks.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh baby swings are lifesavers.
00:07:22 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah.
00:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would literally just pick the baby swing up. My muscles were good. I'd just drag it around the house if I was doing kitchen work working, whatever, because yeah, it'd be when they get bigger bouncers, but yeah.
00:07:37 - Michael F
There we have one.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but swings when they're little, especially the ones that have the mobile and the music at the same time, and they go side to side instead of front and back so that the baby doesn't experience like that falling sensation, and it's just more.
00:07:55 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah, we have that one that goes like this.
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh huh. Yes. Okay, so what day, like is she starting the first week of September?
00:08:11 - Michael F
The contract I think we're going to do is just straight up September, I actually don't even know what day that is, Sunday, okay, so it's probably September 2nd, yeah, so we'll start her on September 2nd.
00:08:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Esther's got a few weeks, do you guys have some like days to figure it out basically where you have slow days where you can just kind of let her catch up on sleep or something?
00:08:36 - Michael F
We're gonna, oh, oh, yeah, you mean like the trial run, oh yeah, no I didn't ask Esther about that, that would be kind of neat, yeah, just like going like a sadder.
00:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, because Dolores works Monday through Friday with the other family, but I was asking about you like on your slow days just being able to give her a relief on a day a week or something where she could just.
00:09:00 - Michael F
catch up. Oh yeah, that's interesting. I have an like on like Monday, I could help her Sunday evening Monday. Yeah. I think about while you're back to work, there's components of it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One is just the actual being able to do it, but two, there is the remember how it felt as soon as you knew you had somebody coming in. There was an instant relief. So if Esther knows that there's a day that she gets to look forward to know if I could just get through this day, Michael's going to be here and I can rest and or food. She just calls me food time. so she just kind of has like, I don't have to get through to September. I just have to get through to this day. And then I can sleep all day long if that's what it takes. just kind of rest and know because I mean, it sometimes, especially when When they're that young, it can feel just so daunting that your body is never going to get a chance to recover because you don't know when you're going to get to sleep at all.
00:10:11 - Michael F
Sleep deprivation is really hard on mental health too. Yeah, I think she's catching up to her now, but yeah, that's a good idea I could offer that. She gets up every two and a half, three hours to pump, which is just killer for her sleeping. And so, yeah, on the nights that I'm around, she just focuses on pumping and then I do the bottle feed, diaper, and then rock the baby back to sleep. So yeah, I mean, I think maybe, yeah, I can ask her if there's anything more that I can do to give her a more prolonged time off, but I know the pumping is really difficult right now because she's, well, she's breastfeeding in the day, and then she says at night, breasts hurt, so she has to pump every three hours. ours to clear it. Yeah, let me ask, let me ask if there's anything I could do to just give her something to look forward to or or something.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just until you get Dolores and in it, you know, it's not necessarily sleep doesn't have to be about nighttime, but just whenever you can get couple extra chunks like yeah, it was interesting. I was reading a study this week about how napping every well, so being a napper, being quantified as being somebody who naps at least three or more times a week, reduces death by heart disease or any kind of help heart failure by like 67% in women and like 84% in men. And that there is no medication, not necessarily being well, a pill, but any other prescription of any type that has such an impact. no pill that you can give anyone with any kind of heart issues that would have as much of an impact. so you can make all the correlation and inferences to what that does. And also, especially with people like you that have circadian issues, napping is really the only type of solution. And we know that it's been around long time because it used to be there was first sleep and second sleep, because there are people who have always been there who couldn't sleep all the way through the night. And so they got a bit little and I did things and went back to sleep. So sometimes trying to solve for nature doesn't really work out well other than doing the thing that we don't want to do in the middle of day, which is not, but it can be a minimum of it can be effective even at 20 minutes. So anything about for both of you, her and her current situation and you just overall Me being able to create nap pods where you work in your offices. Yeah, that's what my fiance does He has in his companies because he cannot sleep I call him a vampire because he's pretty much never slaves and He's got these little like egg-shaped cocoon areas that are nap pods that he can use but also his employees can use too because there are people who just can't sleep and so there's Sounds there's weighted blankets All kinds of things to kind of descend someone to just sleep much faster and come out more rested so that's kind of cool.
00:13:37 - Michael F
Yeah, I I don't think I've ever gotten into a routine of taking a nap I'm just terrible at the willpower to get up But I guess if I had to have enough if I had an appointment that was coming up, I'd have to force myself up Yeah, that's I
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to the world. I'm comatized. So I only nap when the only way that I'm getting through the day with any kind of productivity is I have to nap. I'm physically and cognitively would I would just be a zombie who did nothing and I existed for the rest of the day. And that's unacceptable to me so I'd rather nap and even if I had to take a two hour nap and it screws up my sleep schedule and I'm up till 11 I've got things to do. So everything in life is about trade-offs. That's a trade-off I'll make. But what happens is when I'm really exhausted, it is so hard to wake up.
00:14:34 - Michael F
So there's a few things that I do.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll have something to drink next to me, sugar. Well, like a vitamin water, not a lot. Sugar, caffeine, something like that can do it.
00:14:44 - Michael F
Just having to get up to take care of my child automatically kicks adrenaline in.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's chemical of one sort, even if it's my own chemicals. I can't be late to pick up my daughter. And that goes back to the whole kind of thing about energy sounds. is just purposely manipulating your energy to do what you want to the other thing that I'll do is I will set my alarm and give myself like a 40 minute wake up window when I read anything I could read a book I could read Facebook especially if I read news it just pisses me off so then I get mad but then again the adrenaline kicks in and it's not about engaging with it I don't actually have to care as soon as I read I'm like let's go I got stuff to do but learning what things like if you ever happen to notice is there a thing that wakes you up like I noticed one day that I was really really exhausted and there were two types of things that immediately triggered that my blood got pumping and I was ready to go with no other kind of help other than what I was reading and stimulating it was um something that made me really happy so a message from a friend a sister my sweetheart whatever That's just me and we go, oh, that's awesome, let's go, today's great. Or that is ridiculous, this world is crazy, I get ugh, whatever, and I'm up. It sounds like a stress response, but really I kind of feed off of opposition, so it's not, it's my motivator. But if you figure out what those triggers are for you, or build in a slow wake up, so let's say you take an app and you know that you're really groggy, and there was a podcast you wanted to listen to. If you are able to, now the podcast is going to put you back asleep, you can't do that. Or read it or whatever, but something that starts stimulating your brain so that the wake up process happens, and then just allowing for the time, but when you look at 40, 50, whatever, right, versus losing even two. hours, even if it's for a 20 minute nap and let's say front loading and back loading the slow down the wake up takes you two hours. But if you get to 80 capacity for the rest of the day, that's up to me.
00:17:14 - Michael F
I like that. Yeah, I think there's natural things like right now, I'm actually sitting outside of my daughter's preschool because I'm going to get her at 315. So like on days and I think I told you in jujitsu, right, we actually three months ago, we carved out my schedule so that on Monday and Wednesdays I finished at two and then I drive to her school. I get here by three and then actually I could just sit in this lot right here and nap for 15, 20 minutes, you know, and then that could be my nap on these days, Monday, Wednesdays at least. And then for Thursday, Friday, yeah, I don't know about that wake up window. could probably think of something but even when I'm tired, there's like nothing in the world. world that is interesting to me.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I think if I have like a deadline, like a meeting at one o'clock or, you know, 130, then that's easy.
00:18:07 - Michael F
I just say, okay, well, I could sleep until 110 and then I have a meeting at 150. So yeah, that's interesting. It was three naps a week, three or four.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it was what qualified as a napper was at least three naps consistently.
00:18:24 - Michael F
Okay, so during, yeah, that makes sense during the work week, try to get days when you're just zocked out.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's yeah. And you seem to always have them a couple days where sleep really, really sucked. Right? So if you use them and if you can look kind of for what the pattern is and recognize, oh, this is one of those like minimal capacity days, but maximum, like I got a lot to do. You're like, okay, throw an app in here and do a little journaling and figure out, you know, how does that equation... eight and work out how much more productive are you what does it do to the rest of your nap and what I would do is on days where you take a nap also do something make sure that there's some sunshine because it helps with melatonin production at night and then any kind of movement you can get that day so if it's and it might be harder you might be able to you might have to switch days and figure out what that rhythm is because like for me if I exercise it takes me hours to wind down and be able to go to sleep depending on when it happens and you might not be able to work out or even do jujitsu when you're really sleepy are you ever too tired for jujitsu?
00:19:47 - Michael F
no that's like if there's a day I'm not working at noon I'm just like if I'm exhausted I'll still go I'm always like that like I could work out I mean I used to always work out when I was just exhausted
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because once I did, then I would wake me up or... Right.
00:20:04 - Michael F
But...
00:20:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. Anyway, all right. So those are some things to think about.
00:20:09 - Michael F
So... like the idea of napkin. Sometime ago, I did take a sleep class in med school, and I remember there was stuff about napkin, and you know, it is beneficial to you, and I remember even a seven-minute nap was better than 60 milligrams of caffeine in cognitive tests of recall. I don't know what that study was, like, you might find that one interesting, yeah, I was like, a seven-minute nap is equivalent or better to 60 milligrams of caffeine on cognitive recall tests, like how many things you remember, but yeah, but no, yeah, I like that idea. I'm just trying to make that little change and nap something enjoyable, it's not like something that I have to force myself to do. And I think if I could just carve out a little bit of time to nap, I think that would be really cool.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll try to shoot for too 20 minutes to start and then figure out, you know, what are the things that maybe help you get there? So for me, pressure sound because my brain is too stimulated by certain types of things. But it's not human voices and outside activity. So like, if I was in a car, I could totally sleep because people don't bother me but it's sudden loud noises that will disrupt me or it's consistent conversation because my brain wants to tune into it, even if I really don't want it to. So things to keep, maybe in the car or with you all the time, earplugs and or headphones or earbuds, know, something where you can play some and figure out what frequencies work best for you, white noise, brown noise, peak noise, prone to pink and brown, especially brown noise, a mask, which may be too much of a signal in a parking lot, if the parking lot is safe. Yeah, think about those things you do. You don't want to already know you're not being so much, but if you have a cap pulled down low, you still get the pressure on your head, it still blocks the sun out of your eyes. It has the same kind of effect, but it doesn't really send a visual signal to everybody walking by necessarily that you're napping, especially if you're like holding your phone or whatever, like you could just be listening to something. Potentially they have little weighted, instead of weighted blankets, they have weighted, it's like a lap pad. Weighted things can help people get that faster. anyway, if you're really going to be on a mission of sleep hacking and trying to get the most rejuvenation, cognitive and physical performance out of the least, then find the things that get you there faster, that get you to REM sleep or deep sleep faster and as frequently as needed in order to be able to function at the way that you want to through life.
00:22:57 - Michael F
Yeah, I like that.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we have I have the
00:23:00 - Michael F
I have like the headphones. I have three different eye masks that I alternate with. I've never tried a weighted blanket, but I'm interested in that. I'm always hot. I always thought I'd run hot. So that's why I love the car has like cool air conditioning all the time, so I'm always cool in here.
00:23:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you always keep a sheet on you though? Like do you always want to have some sort of, okay, so that's mostly like PTSD and trauma people. So that might not be something, which is why it's really good for people, a lot of people because so many people have been through trauma. So that might not even be anything that's beneficial to you.
00:23:41 - Michael F
It might be more fun.
00:23:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I I'm in my birthday suit, like just splaining out. Free and safe, free and safe. So napping then you have to just get, so maybe taking off your shoes and being barefoot.
00:23:56 - Michael F
I hope you get a nap better.
00:23:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like if you're in a scrubs nothing constructing so that just all of those things and if you know like today I'm going to take a nap just making sure that that's the case maybe you've got some loose scrubs for nap days I don't know just all of the things and and you'll I think you'll notice over time that you figured out because you're being intentional and strategic about it it won't always work out that you can get it but you'll be able to operate at a higher level more often than not and catch up on sleep more often than not like I have gotten to the point where I don't even have to actually sleep I just have to lay down and close my eyes 20 minutes half an hour and I'm powering through the rest of the day like I actually slept and it's shocking me but I also did discover some really good things um dl phenolanaly it's an amino acid and it's pretty much replaced capping for me it's amazing and uh I did with depression and anxiety, that's gone. And, uh, gospel title sharing helps me with my ADD. Um, during the day helps me stay focused, helps me like, I was really experienced, especially in Perry, menopause, this type of the tongue thing. could not, I've got all the words except for one. And I can't, like, I feel the word, I know what it represents, but I could not say the one word. And so I haven't been dealing with that, but being a phospholipid, it, um, coats the cells so that they can communicate better. And, uh, you know, all of these little things. And then, um, the anything that helps with the neurotransmitters, because I do have those types of issues. They all help with sleep. Uh, things to think about and find out like what your issues are as we go through this. Okay. Um, to the spreadsheet now, you're not really where we can look at it on a good screen. And it's probably been a while. So I'm just going to go ahead and recap what you wrote. Hold on, me go back to my notes real quick.
00:26:10 - Michael F
I'll be easier for you to analyze. This is our second week trying it. Is it easier in the spreadsheet format like this?
00:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when this becomes really actually the most effective is when you've done time tracking and we have more details on the things and I can see basically the inventory of your hours, where your time is going, how much of your time is going, and then so if you tell me that your most profitable activities face-to-face visits now, you could quantify that because you've got meanings tracked. So we could do some math on that and we could figure out what that is. But then there would be other conversations and we are about to start getting into spending most of our time on this business stuff. It was more important to me to figure out you getting the house cleaner, the assistant, having some of that, you know, this is groundwork. But, but come September, almost all of our calls, I'm going to want you to be in front of your computer, we're going to be going over data. of the time, anytime something comes up, you know, like we just can't do that, then what we will do is redirect the conversation to catching up more in detail long sleeve, probably little bit more philosophical, just different thoughts, those types of things, like we started in the beginning. so, as a natural kind of consequence of just life, and some of those coming up, this is how we kind of circle back, have the technical, analytical, and come back to the kind of philosophical, it's not really that, it's still practical and analytical, but it's just more about how we're thinking about things. So, you, let me go ahead and let's see.
00:27:56 - Michael F
I'm excited for the business data and the numbers because As, yeah, I I think I told you that's what burned to me in my first business, know, between 20, 17, essentially. six years of my fricking life, I wasted because I never looked at numbers. And I'm really so I'm really excited to have someone to, and even now I'm not really looking at my numbers.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really excited to have someone to, you know, force me to look at the numbers with me. We can start. That doesn't have to wait till September. I'm glad that you're excited. So let me look at next week. Because you're just getting back to week, but that doesn't mean that still have my bookkeepers are still sending me monthly, you know, monthly balance sheets.
00:28:45 - Michael F
I have no idea how to read a balance sheet, but I'm pretty good at P&L now. But, you know, those are stuff that I can always look at. And yeah, my bank statements, of course. And yeah.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. know what's helpful for you or what what we can do to optimize things, what you need, but um, I usually don't go deeper than P and L's and depending on how segmented some of the accountant get with that stuff, sometimes my eyes glaze over and I'm like, I want to get that deep, but yeah, I have a detail of P and L that my bookkeepers do and a condensed P and L that I've created with them in a PDF document. So we could show you both and that would be great. Um, and then just kind of going over them in detail. So the things that we're looking for first is, is anything bloated? anything bleeding? if I ask you about something and you're like, I don't really know about any of it, then I want to dig deeper into that. Are you just wasting money? Because everybody, not everybody, but so far, everybody I've worked with has had that happening at some point where it was an expense that got started and is no longer really as valuable or or efficient or something like that. we'll look at that. But then what we're looking for too is, so, because this is driving me nuts, got something in my eye and I just won't. I wanna get it out, but busy. so like looking at most profitable activities, you have Q and E face to face visits. So what do you do that generates those visits?
00:30:27 - Michael F
How do you get more of those? Yeah, that's a good question. It's a lottery system. Well, just take a step back. I have 10 offices in Northern California, and I roughly visit each of those once a month. And I step clients, I try to stack as many clients into those days, so I just have to go once. So to get a person, it's a lottery system based on how close that office is to an injured person that's claiming a work injury. So that's why I go to. like random cities that are highly populous and more blue collared so that because that's where injured people are. So in terms of like how I get more lottery hits, I have like a list of the most popular zip codes in California and I do look at that every about every year and I can kind of move locations within zip codes to find where the injured people are living in zip codes so we've tried to optimize that for the most part in our current we can only have 10 locations that's why I'm not doing like 20 but we try to optimize as best we can and that's how we've come up with our current 10 locations but I think there's more that we could do like if we kept switching them out but yeah part about switching them out is it takes about it's about it takes three months to close one location and then as soon as that's closed it takes about three to three to four months to ramp up on the next, so you're looking at like a cycle of six months to replace every one of my 10 locations. Yeah, so that's why like as long as we're maintaining at least three or four hits of the lottery every month, we're okay with that's that's what we've been doing. There's there has been locations that have gotten me less than two lottery picks a month. Those are the ones like in San Francisco, no one picked me ever in the lottery. So I cut that and I switched it to Merced, California. So that's that's the most recent switch we made.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing, do you have a report of like a spreadsheet or anything tracked where you have how many lottery hits that you get each month for each location?
00:32:48 - Michael F
I do, yes.
00:32:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Esther's manager has that.
00:32:52 - Michael F
Is that something that could be shared with me so that I could Absolutely. Yeah, I would love to see that I haven't looked at it in a box since I changed locations.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, what was that?
00:33:02 - Michael F
About three months ago.
00:33:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't even know if I have any.
00:33:07 - Michael F
Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me collect that. That's easy to collect. I'll just ask for a minute. Okay.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put that on my list.
00:33:25 - Michael F
There's also little like, you know, games that are played because the more doctors that do what I do in a particular zip code, that have an office in that same zip code is me, the less lottery hits I get, right?
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not just a population of how many people live in San Jose.
00:33:41 - Michael F
It's how many doctors just like me are in that zip code and that dilutes my lottery pick. So that's why I went to Merced to try to see if there's more fertile ground where there's less people willing to go out there. But it is two hours away.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's two and a half hours away. So do you get a monthly report of? injuries in the location and that doctors existing in the location?
00:34:04 - Michael F
No, it's a report that I asked California for. California keeps how many lottery, lottery generated in each zip code. And then they keep track of how many doctors are in each code. So I can see how many injured workers there are, lottery hits, and I can see how many doctors per zip code. So I can request that report from the state.
00:34:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't done that. I can that monthly.
00:34:30 - Michael F
I could.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't. I haven't in like six months since I chose. If when we get to an assistant or somebody figure out if there's anybody that exists that you delegate this to, but deputize somebody to do that every month and to get it to you, you shouldn't be doing it, but you should be looking at it.
00:34:50 - Michael F
So is there already somebody that exists who would have the ability to accomplish that for you and who counted on it? Our manager should, you know, she's I'm a risk master's manager should probably be the one to do this because, um, yeah, that's her. That's wonderful job just to make sure we stay in business and the job, right?
00:35:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so let's, let's make sure that that gets done and you're looking at that every month because then you can, um, do projections more accurately and rather than be proactive, like watch, there's an adjustment, but also sometimes, um, this probably because you have so many locations, you're probably a really good sense of what's actually happening with it. The doctor population is something you wouldn't be aware of unless you're looking at it. And so let's say the doctor population is decreasing steadily and you don't know. And you're wondering, so, so there's a couple of things that I think that could happen that you may not necessarily know that that walk watching it every month could tell you. of all, if doctors are leaving, why are they leaving? Do they know something? You don't know. Has there been some legislation change that's creating issues in the business that hasn't caught up with you yet that maybe you don't want to be in that location, whatever, I don't know, the state versus local government, probably not too much of a big deal for regulations. but also, let's say, because it's a lottery, you're not getting any hints for little long, you're like, I got to pull out and go somewhere else. But simultaneously, doctors are leaving, retiring, moving, whatever. You don't know why they're moving. You just know that they're not there. Maybe instead of pulling out, you want to ride that wave out a little bit longer because the population's going. So, and you know, if you're going to be doing this for a long time, let's say, five, 10, 15, 20 years, whatever, maybe not that long. But the longer that you're going to do it, the more data you have, two things. If you're going to sell it, all the data that you have makes it more sellable, or if you ever wanted to get investors, probably not. But I'm just saying data that's There's so many different reasons why you want to have as much as possible. And as far as KPIs, that performance indicator or, I can't think of the other word that I want, it's not KPIs, whatever, but those those those indicator numbers of what could have an impact on the business, doctor population being one of them, injuries and injuries will have a correlation to industry. So let's say the industry is expanding or shrinking, if it's expanding, more injuries are going to be And that's another thing too, if you if you watch that. So we just want to have more information, track it, track it regularly, bottom line.
00:37:38 - Michael F
I like the idea, it's something that I know I should look at and I know, actually I remember why I haven't put my manager in is because in this industry, not a lot of people know you can get that data. It's called the Public Relations Act, actually you could get it, anyone can get it, you have to make a public relations data act from California and a lot of the my competitors don't know about. this. So they just kind of blindly pick locations. But I've known about this for a while. That's why I haven't given my manager this data. Only me and Esther know about it as much as we trust our manager.
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is a very small You find an NDA because even though they're really only worth as much as you're willing to go to war with, most people are more afraid of them because they don't know that.
00:38:24 - Michael F
Okay, that's a good idea. Just like be like, hey, this is part of your- yeah, give her the NDA to sign and then be like, okay, I have this confidence. So remember, Swiss, when you learn, help people make the right decisions.
00:38:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or relation is, here's your NDA. Go do this. Oh, I better not tell anybody. Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. I don't think we've ever had our sign in NDA. mean, you should anyway because you're a doctor. I think just anything about your business. You have a specific unique business. They're as you involved. Again, they're only as good as you're willing to fight for and go to war over, but most people don't know that.
00:39:10 - Michael F
Yeah, make it easy to be tempted to share the data freely. Go on webinar and speak about, yeah, Dr.
00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Food, your request to this report tells you all the data. Yep. And sometimes you can help people understand too, because sometimes people are just like, well, I'm just telling Billy Bob over here. Billy Bob doesn't know anything. Billy Bob doesn't do anything like that. You don't know who Billy Bob knows and who he talks to. He might have a friend that's in a similar business and they just have to be chatting. Oh, yeah, I heard about this thing that this guy did. And now your competitor knows it. So people are more connected than we think. They have more conversations than we think. So just say like, the safest thing is, you just don't discuss this outside of this office, period, end of story. And you could say it in the Fuji way, not the Tina with the I'll cut you eyeballs. I'm not finding a violin or anything. I'm calm. It's the sweeper in me playing soccer that is like you will not pass that has never died.
00:40:11 - Michael F
So funny.
00:40:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay, so sales calls to law firms for July medical. So what is an interesting one? Yeah, what generates the sales calls? What is the rhythm to that? What are like, tell me everything all around that and then I'll formulate more questions.
00:40:40 - Michael F
Well, when I started this business, um, July, this is completely so this is July medical. This is the one I worked with Mark. Mark's law firm on. I had no clients like who's going to send their client to a telehealth doctor when they can go to an in-person doctor, right? So, um, initially, I, I look back at the business that I. close with my partner and I took the whole list of everyone that had ever sent me a patient from that business and then I just literally tried to get on the phone with them and yeah I would just try to the case managers that work for those law for I found that lawyers don't do anything the lawyers don't maybe mark those but those lawyers don't it's the case managers that give me business they send their clients to me so I just got that list from my old clinic and I just called them and thankfully most of them remembered my clinic remembered my reports and I had to explain to them yeah I do the you know I do this on televisits but I'm like a quarterback and then yeah a couple of them got it so you know I got a couple referrals the first month and I just kept doing that up until about I did it for about the first six months and once I got to about six months into the business which was September of last year I kind of cut back on doing that because I just had I was I was getting good traction anyway and you know I was
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
moments are right though.
00:42:01 - Michael F
If you're not moment to mean you're dying.
00:42:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're moment to be. You're either getting or losing but you're never you never stagnant really. So be purposely intentionally. So one of the things I'd like you to consider is where in your schedule and.
00:42:25 - Michael F
Well I just not on that note. It was actually a conscious decision that Mark and I had talked about. In this in personal injury it's quite litiginous and the insurance companies will come after the doctors actually more so than the lawyers because we don't have patient client privilege and so they could take my deposition, take me to court. So at the point where my business was getting between like three to four hundred visits a month which is where I've been at for like last six months. Eight months now. That was in September, and that's when Mark and I were like, you know, if I get too big, I'm going to stick out, especially because I'm... So we actually sort of like throttled it, because if I kept getting, and what I do now is I kind of cherry pick my referrals, like I actually started turning away some, like for instance, there's a class of injury called slip and balls or dog bites, and those are highly litiginous because it's like, well, how do you know they slipped, right? There's no... It's hard to prove, and so the doctors get questioned a lot. So I actually stopped in like December, I stopped taking that with Mark's help, and now I turn away all that business, even though it could make me like a lot more money, right? But that was the way that I've, instead of like increasing the number, I've tried to pick better cases.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I do you have, anything where you've done the map, a spreadsheet, a calculator of volume over quality and what that looks like to your revenue line over time?
00:44:18 - Michael F
No, it's hard because I don't get paid, I don't get paid for about maybe like 18 months to two years, like I haven't gotten paid for, like some have started paying me, but it usually takes like maybe a year, 18 months to get paid.
00:44:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm aware of that because of mark stuff.
00:44:38 - Michael F
Yeah, it's freaking wild.
00:44:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So don't you, don't you know though in roughly six months what the amount's gonna be supposed to be?
00:44:52 - Michael F
Well, I mean, I can, I have like my spreadsheet and I can tell you right now how much I expect from each case. case, like, my average. So yeah, I could apply that. Really, I'm just looking at how many cases I get in a month, right?
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just multiply that by 300. So there's multiple things. Like, first of all, we look at the case volume, we look at attorney fees, which is, and I don't know, is there a variation of how much you get paid? There's not right? That's like always the same for every case.
00:45:27 - Michael F
I mean, if the lawyer does really well, like the average, like, I haven't done it in a while, but each law firm has a different average, right? sweet laws average is about 500 per case, but my law firms are like 300, right? but I just use 300 in my head because I'm like, well, that's the most conservative thing.
00:45:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I was getting at is that there are certain data points.
00:45:56 - Michael F
How many cases come in?
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many get settled? a month, how many get paid out?
00:46:03 - Michael F
That's right.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now he has Lidify in Salesforce. Do you have, do you just use spreadsheets?
00:46:13 - Michael F
Like where do you track your cases? When I get a check, I have a Google spreadsheet that is, I've mirrored it. So I've created a second Google spreadsheet off the first one that no one else can see except me. And then when I get a check, I just find their name and put how much money I got to get the call.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a better system.
00:46:36 - Michael F
Yeah, yeah. It's hard to track my month. I have no idea how much I got per month, except for my bookkeepers will tell me.
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would it be helpful to have just one of our calls just be devoted to that business and bring Mark in for some of his ideas?
00:46:52 - Michael F
Also, no, this is not a judgey thing. This is just because he and I have worked together.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So also, it'll help me not feel stupid because I When I get into a new business, there's so much I don't know, but I'm in here and I got to be confident and ask these questions, so this is me telling you you're not the only one, like we're all trying to figure out how to do the best thing where we're at. And we all have different skill sets that we bring to the table so, you know, my experience doing the same things over and over again in different businesses. I mean, again, I've got lots of years on you. Lots of years of practice, lots of watching my own thoughts, watching other people's faults and seeing that there are certain things to do. I'm not raising brand new babies anymore. Like, there's so many different things. But even with all of that, there's way more that I don't know that I do know, and it always will be like that. So, you know, but I was just thinking that for two things. Just his mark has been ideas, and it would help me understand your dynamic a little bit better too. to be able to see that in action on a call. I feel like I might feel like a third wheel with a romance that goes on. so we'll talk about that. would you share with me? And if you if you can, because I don't know if you can with so you do not get privileged with your with these people because that's accidents or how does that work?
00:48:36 - Michael F
Yeah, everything that I do pretty much is discoverable under with a subpoena. Yeah, it's very uncomfortable. Like they can even go as far as text message. That's why Mark and I communicate on signal because those delete and I have all my staff message on signal, all our calls are on signal. But yeah, unfortunately, everything is. I mean, like sharing, sharing data with consultants, sharing data with accountants, bookkeepers, that's not a problem.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because what I would like to see is basically anything that you have that you track any of your business. So what would be really helpful is, okay, this is the record, anything that you can do to give me a full understanding of why you do it, why you do it this way, what it tracks, how long you've been tracking it, that type of thing. That honestly, if that was all that we accomplished over the next couple of weeks is transferring that data so I could start kind of wrapping my head around it so that I can formulate the best questions. But here's the thing I want you to always think about when you're planning out your day, when you're planning out your week, when you're planning out your month, when you're planning out your quarter, and I don't even know if you think about it in terms of quarterly goals and things like that, that would have been my guess. Which is okay, we're just really getting track to like you're just very brand new on your own, you know, I never. used to think like that. It's really only been probably the last 10 years that I've been working that way and I could improve a lot and I do the quotes because so for example I have Mark and I think I told you to read Emith. lot of these business type books assume values that I have that I don't have and then I never will have. For example Mark's value is if I want to go in the office for month I'm not going to go into the office for a month. Now almost anybody who's a business consultant is going to say you're insane that's stupid you can't run a business like that. I would not because I would say you're not going to run the best business that way. There's going to be a lot that's going to suffer that way but there's trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in the business it's profitable. Your people are happy and your highest value is the freedom. to do what you want to with your time, I think you created the perfect thing. And business books and business courses don't approach things like that. They will give you that judge you kind of like, well, you could do better. You could hire someone, you could do this. Yeah, it's, but everything comes with more stress, every person that you hire, it's more stressed, it's more responsibility, it's more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to mean expectations is where most stress and anxiety comes from. The more people you involve, and the more, you know, you're like, these are our goals, this is what we're doing, the more you have expectations that you have to meet. So if your higher value is flexibility, and fluidity in life, so that you can be a free agent across the board, then the trade-offs are going to be, you're going to lose some of the structure, and you're going to lose some of the benefit of the structure and momentum, but you're going to maintain that autonomy. and that freedom throughout your life. So you're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and the freedom is the first thing, which is generally who I'm working with, because yeah, I could do all of that, I don't want to. I don't either. I could have been a valedictorian and I'm like, that's way too much effort. I don't want to study. I will, whatever I accumulate during the class, that's it. I still graduated with honors, but I did zero homework. Zero studying. I'm just like, why? I'd rather play soccer. rather do this. I'd rather do that. I'd rather go, yeah. cheerleader and football and track and softball and tennis. Is that everything?
00:52:52 - Michael F
Basketball.
00:52:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like to play. I still like to play a lot. So. You're you're in the season of parenthood. So we'll take all those things are in the count, but when What time is it?
00:53:08 - Michael F
When do we start?
00:53:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, 15 When you're looking at these things I Always want you to start now. You're probably not gonna be looking at this in the week But but I would like you to just glance at this at least once a week for little while while you're starting to consider Time-blocking Which is not necessarily something you're going to do On a physical level like putting into the calendar you can and we can talk about that I Do mental time blocks because that's how loose I keep my calendar There are some things that are physically on there. They're the appointments. They're the meanings Everything else is I am keeping kind of a mental note of the types of things that I want to do and I always know what my priority is I always know I'm always thinking about it. So I always know and also because I've been doing it so long and it's so steady. I don't have to do that. But I still do on occasion come back and look at things like this myself. So you've got in these two businesses. Now QME is the one that makes all the money right now, right?
00:54:17 - Michael F
Yeah. And that's the freedom thing and it's why I July because as long as I'm doing QMEs, I have to do face to face like today, right? There's no getting around that. Like I know that at least 10 days a month, have to 10 days a month or maybe eight, depending on if it's full or not. But like at least eight days a month, I have to be somewhere and that, yeah, I think it's good for the amount of money it makes.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, I mean, a long term, I would like to off for a month.
00:54:52 - Michael F
And not have to worry about that. So that's why that's a big reason why I like July and why I'm just kind of foster it.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, for those purposes, the thing that you want to be thinking about with the QME is how do we maximize lottery hits, which is retracting the data and seeing what it is. And we can use some AI to look at the reports, too, instead of having just brain fatigue going over and trying to look at patterns we might be missing. And we can do that. And I'll show you how, even if you already use it, almost every time I show somebody something, I process it differently. And so there's a new thought, oh, I didn't think to do it this way. So we'll do that. And so every week, you at least ponder multiple times throughout the week, is there anything I can do to increase these visits? If you just think of it like, no, not really, but you still want it to be kind of at the back of your mind constantly, so that you're intuitive. except there's a kind of just on that, you know what I mean? You might hear a conversation about something that just was like, maybe I should be looking in this area, whatever. So just the kind of thinking about it just increases your perception or opportunities that might be out, or threats. And for a July medical, we want to figure out what levers there are. So, you want to make sure you don't have opposing goals. Sorry. This smoke is super bad here today.
00:56:34 - Michael F
The air quality is like 281.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The fires are so bad.
00:56:38 - Michael F
Where are you again?
00:56:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Southern Oregon. Commathals. I don't know if you're part of it. It's a hit though. But yeah, but we get everybody's smoke. It just lands on our basin. What was I thinking? Okay, so you have to watch for opposing goals. If the goal is July medical is your path to freedom, but you're trying to stay under the radar, so you're not growing. Do those conflict?
00:57:11 - Michael F
Yes. Yes.
00:57:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And if autonomy is the ultimate goal, then are you going to live your life based off of fear of competition? I would say that's a terrible way to live. You have to decide what's the most important thing. Now, I'm not saying don't mitigate those risks in whatever ways that you can. What I'm saying is that we figure out are there other ways to do that. So those are longer conversations.
00:57:52 - Michael F
They're not necessarily longer conversations. They're ongoing conversations.
00:57:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These are the kind of things where answers reveal themselves because we're intentionally looking for them. solutions. But you have to decide and you already have, but you need to make sure also that you're on the same page with whoever you're talking to, including Mark. But if your priority is July medical is your path to being as free as you want with your time, then that has to be the price. Originally, priority didn't even have it was it was singular.
00:58:24 - Michael F
There was no plural form of the word. Yeah, that's true. I can imagine. It was just there was there was one.
00:58:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the one thing. I see now we have multiple and and they're right. But there has to be one greatest above all priority. Okay. And that should be autonomy because that insinuates and implies that you've got the financial resources that like I talk about these three different currencies, time, energy, and money that that that autonomy or freedom means that you've got all of what you want and need sufficiently. at least, right? And you want for nothing. And everything else feeds that goal. So you maximize how they feed that goal. There is, by nature of life, an enemy in opposition to all things. So if you're constantly focusing on the enemy in the opposition, what you're not focusing on is the growth.
00:59:29 - Michael F
Oh, yeah, that's absolutely right in July right now.
00:59:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what we think about comes about where we put our energy and mind to, that's what increases. If you're focused on the scarcity and the threat, that's which you're increasing and manifesting. And if you're focusing on the growth, if there's sufficient growth, it mitigates competition anyway. If you're networking so well and taking care of of the people that send you business, the attorneys, if they're just falling in love with you like Mark's tweeted, what do you care if there's competition? They're going to cut you out? No. Also, I fully believe you can't take what's mine and you can't take what's Fuji's. It's either for you or it's not. So even if that's wrong, we know that there is evidence from MRIs, from all kinds of things that show what our brains do when we believe things, when we focus on things. It activates us. We behave differently. So you just have to make a choice of am I going to focus on playing small, on purpose, on purpose is what you just told me or being free.
01:00:58 - Michael F
Yeah, that's a it's a good point. I mean, yeah, I've been just staying kind of small since September of last year. Really, I haven't pushed growth at all. I'm just, yeah, it's been nice. It's, I don't know, nice, but it's kind of bruising and we're growing in the right way, I think, but I'm not really pushing it at all.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's kind of weird, huh? It is weird.
01:01:20 - Michael F
Well, and there is definitely something to be said about keeping the guardrails on so that you don't grow too big, that it becomes a problem.
01:01:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then if you're looking at scaling, then, then a part of that is hiring the right kind of person, hiring somebody who can help it grow so that it doesn't become a burden, like Mark has Mary, but also he's got some really great attorneys and he's investing and coaching in them to make them better leaders. And we've done things like more surveys to find out what their weaknesses are. what are the things that they feel like they need to know. So we've got um grief counseling for the intake people so that they could learn how to have those conversations with people who have lost loved ones because they died. It's some of the the intake people they're like that is really heavy. I don't know how to deal with that because they feel that other person's energy and it was hard on them. And that had never been addressed before until we asked the surveys and in a particular way like his net promoter score surveys were useless to me. I'm like you're not asking anything that is very corporate-esque and it says I'm asking you because I feel like I have to ask you I don't really care. So we changed the questions and then the other thing that we found out is that people feel like they're not good at sales calls which we already knew but the fact that they're aware of it and they want to be better is wonderful. So we went and got black something. I can't remember what it is. Anyway, and they came in and they taught sales. And her best attorney, just from reading their book, like, she already figured out a strategy that was making her money immediately. Sam, yep. so, and it wasn't that everybody was better across the board from all of these things. It was that there were pockets of improvement, but they wouldn't have existed without finding out what they needed. That wouldn't have existed if Mark did invest in coaching for himself and caring about leadership. So his goal still is, I don't really want to go into the office. And so, my job is to figure out how do we make the best out of all of these things as much as they can be without you going in and being a leader and overseer. He's still leading, but he's leading from a recliner because that's what he wants. nothing wrong with that. I mean, he's still like, he's hard working, he's doing lots of things, he's just not in the office with his people. And statistically, that's not what you think of as somebody leading, you know, there. But he's happy with it. It's also not the most profitable thing, but Mark has been growing happier and happier and happier since I've known him. I used to call him Eor. That's funny. Because I'd say how you think he's I'd say, okay, bye, have a great day. He's like, yeah. Okay, yours and Tiggers, you know, he has a Tigger.
01:04:51 - Michael F
That's so funny.
01:04:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and now he just, he almost never has that energy. And when he does, he automatically is like, yeah. But this is what's good, and this is what's good, and this is what's good, and I'm like that's my boy right there So It's all it's all the process anyway. Oh crap the time. Geez Okay So I want you to start thinking more about how do you get more of your most profitable activity or More out of your most profitable activity. So you're not necessarily trying to spend more time doing it But trying to milk what you can out of it sometimes it's more time and then How we can support that the other work activities? This is where time tracking comes in we want to figure out what we can delegate and so if you look at it and go These are things also. What is not getting done? That should be done. Go ahead and put that down there and we'll highlight that in a different way Things that you know should be happening in your business, but isn't we want that list And then step two, oh, you did, no, I knew you didn't. Okay, yeah, step two. I really want you to fill out step two because what that is is things that energize you, things that drain you. it ranks how good you are at stuff. So that helps with delegation, but it also helps us figure out where's the sharpening of the saw activities that we need to do. And even if we're only putting a little bit of saw sharpening activities monthly, right? The pace is gonna be dictated by you and what you wanna do. But categorizing the things that you do across profitability and then energy and then skill really helps us rank where the time goes so that we can get the most out of it and also how we can utilize other people to get the most out of your existing team and assets and kind of future pace and figure out What would come next in order to get you to more of the profitable either activities or higher leverage profitable activities? Yep, I like that plan Okay All right, so I will send you some notes and In a few minutes because otherwise I might forget and I don't want to do that And then I will talk to you Monday cool.
01:07:25 - Michael F
I have my alarm set this time, and I will not miss it I have two three four alarms back up And always tuned it if you want to because my Mondays are crazy long but that you said that that was consistently the best for you Monday is the most consistent day that I have all four.
01:07:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:07:44 - Michael F
Yeah, so Good luck.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I only work one Monday a month generally So I didn't Quality to protein and take the day before And just let me know did you did anything pop out to you.
01:08:03 - Michael F
Okay. Okay. was good.
01:08:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any questions or anything?
01:08:08 - Michael F
No, thank you so much for scheduling.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

> 00:00:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hello, 18 a good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you? I'm doing good. How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, I'm glad to speak with you today. Um, have you had any kind of background about about what this conversation would be about or what to expect or anything?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.
00:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so last year, I met with Samantha and Lorenz, and we had one conversation, and we talked a little bit just about leadership, because it was more an exploratory call, like, happens if we talk to the attorneys, not the business owner that hired me. And Samantha wasn't interested. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. This process isn't for everybody, but Lorenz kind of around with it. And so we had a conversation that he was particularly interested in, and I'm telling you this because the approach is different for everyone. So what you're interested in and what might be beneficial to you may have nothing to do with anybody else, and I'm not interested in doing anything that's not helpful to you or not interesting to you. So keep that in mind. But what he was interested in is the fact, first of all, Samantha puts up big numbers and she beats everybody. She beats everybody in terms of attorney fees and how many cases she does. I don't know if you know that, but she does.
00:04:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I figured, I figured.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but her approach is different and her approach doesn't work for everybody. You know, there are different types of personalities inside of Sweet Law. There's been shifting around, you know, different case managers on different teams, different assistants on different teams, things like that. And a lot of that, Mark has driven based on conversations with different attorneys and just finding who works best with there.
00:04:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So that's one little type of tweet, right?
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But for Lorenz, he saw those numbers and he's like, I could do better. I want to do better, but I don't know how to do better. And so, after having a conversation with him, I figured out something that I thought would work for him and I give him a book called multiple. pliers. And that is how to make better leaders out of everybody around you. So instead of him, because he didn't feel like he was really bringing the best out of the people on his team, and also he didn't feel that that was his strength. So I gave him that book and he had a couple of aha moments, but fast forward three months later, and he almost was doubling his monthly numbers. So, you know, that that's that's some good results. And he was interested in this. So I don't know what might be good for you. I know you're fairly new. New to Sweet Law. Now, I don't know how new you are as an attorney.
00:05:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
know you're a younger one attorney. don't know if you practiced anywhere else before. No, I'm coming up on just putting my second year and know that.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did you become an attorney?
00:05:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
My uncle was an attorney and when I was a kid, my guy was just following his footsteps. I saw it was like a lucrative opportunity. I feel like the type of work is things that I'm able to tolerate more than most people would. So I do feel like it's something that because I know the average time for an attorney is like five years before they kind of make a decision on what they want to do. They want to go somewhere else, you know, but I'm cool like the work that I do coming in here talking to clients, getting like, you know, complained at why is the number this or, you know, just juggling things. I just feel like I have a good tolerance for that and I can just crank work out. Now, there's like two sides to being a lawyer, like some are in court all the time, some are, you know, doing what we do here where we're just office dealing with clients, which I feel like is better for for me, which is why I pick this area, but if I have friends that are attorneys, they're like, I can't do what you do. Like, it's just boring. But for me, I'm like, I don't want go on court once in my career. You know, so I don't know. I like what I do. And I just feel like I have what it takes to make a good living off of it. And it's cool. Like, we have this one case, the kid was like 22 years old, pretty big injuries. And the money that we got for him, he was able to pay off school that he's going to. things like that are cool to know that, like, you know, that took a chance in hiring us and we were able to change a portion of his life, which is pretty cool. On every case is like that, some clients always complain about the money that they get. But every now and then you. get something cool where you feel good about about what you do. So, that's good.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good insight that that helps me actually to learn a lot about you. So you would you consider yourself pretty easy going?
00:08:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my my requirements are like very low as long as I have a few hours to go to the gym during the day. That's all I really care about. Well, coming to work early, you would have to do pretty high patients level. did go to a military college, so things that would probably stress people out more or like start to freak out a little bit earlier. I typically have like a longer range of where I'm able to tolerate it before it gets to that point, which why I'm like just so chill at work because I've been through so much.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing.
00:09:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, this is nothing, you know, um, yeah, I'm a pretty talent person. Like, I don't, or how many needs, you know, but do you feel like do you feel driven or do you feel like I'm just like meandering kind of through life and it's just chill and is really big goals? just don't like I'm the type of person I'll just rather do the work than just, you know, talk talk about, you know, what my big plans are or like, I keep a lot of things to myself and like, yeah, you like blink in like two years later, it's like, whoa, how did Pat get there? It's like, you know, putting in the work like after high school, I went straight to college. After college, I went straight to law school like never really did you live in like, kind of a poverty or like gang area or anything when you were younger? No. And then I parents weren't like really well off, but We weren't like on food stamps or anything like that.
00:10:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not necessarily that you were poor, but that was it around you.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, not really.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. you just have a. You remind me of a lot of people that had like lived in tough neighborhoods coming up, you know, and so I was just wondering, I was curious about that. So I know that you hope you kind of keep things close to the chest, but would you share any of your professional goals with me?
00:10:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm two years in. Obviously, like the first day I got here, I saw that like Sam was the highest. So there's like a competitive nature, but so a lot of respect. Because when Mark hired me, I didn't really have any experience in this. field, first that I had when I first started now, obviously like I got more cases and have a team now, but like I always joke around with their teller like, because I don't have as many cases as she does, so obviously I can't really get the numbers there, but you know, obviously my goal is to be the one that does leading the firm as far as the numbers go, just from a competitive standpoint, obviously every month like things change, but I love that. Because I know I'm still pretty young, but, you know, some months I'd be Lauren's or I don't know if you've met Tyler before. And I have like half the cases that they do. So like, to me, that's like my way of showing that, you know, because I'm obviously they're older, they have more experience and education, but that's my way of trying to get respect that like, hey, I just got here and I'm, you know, starting to make my mark. So that's really important for me.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So do you keep track of stats like how long it takes your cases, what percentage of the time you're hitting a max settlement and what's the other one? Just how many cases you're taking? Like, I know that you're given cases. But what are you doing in terms of monitoring those numbers? and trying to push them, if anything.
00:13:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I have a list of cases that get settled every month, so I see a daily track of what the number is for that month for settlements and how much the attorneys fees we brought in. There's also like a little note on there if it's settled for the policy limits.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure if you know what that is. Yep, that's what I meant to say when I said how much, yeah.
00:13:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so obviously every case we pushed for that, but it doesn't always work out that way. Right. know Mark keeps a better track of how many policy limits cases we get. I don't know if so many cases were because I can keep a lot of things in my mind, like right now because I don't know as many, but I'm really on top of the numbers. Because that's obviously the indicator that, you know, Boss looks at to see where everybody's at you are you able to see that and let if I The list do you have access to you have access to let if I everybody does right?
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, okay, so we've been working on the dashboard for the last three years This has been a whole long process and and one of the things is just really trying to put together the numbers and a really clear way That are important that help us figure out. Okay. How are we performing? Across the board. How are we performing across attorneys and pods? How are we performing across? Types of cases how are we performing across? Vendors who bring us the leads because we have several different vendors that bring us leads They all perform differently how are we performing across states? So like we're really analyzing breaking everything down and You know how it is any anywhere you go you've got some people that come in to collect paychecks And we've got
00:15:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
uh people that come in because they got missions to accomplish and goals to accomplish and then we got people that are just in there trying to slam everybody like there's a whole spectrum right of how they show up and um so um you said that there was something that like sometimes that at night you'll think about like what you could do better what are some of the things that i've popped up in your head um just being more efficient on certain tasks because when i started it was just me with my case load and then in january i got a case manager and then like march i got an assistant um so i'm just doing every piece of the case myself um now obviously i have people who are being paid to help me um so it's more like let me focus on certain things that are gonna that i need To do, for example, negotiating or, you know, pushing certain cases out, monitoring, that's one of the things I did the last month is going through the case load early and figuring out why something is stuck, or how can I move it forward? Because the more cases you get, some things start to slip and get stuck. Mark does a good job of going through our cases, too, reminding us like, hey, you know, this one can be moved and get done this month. So just kind of trusting another person to do their job, see like things that kind of slip. Because when I first cut a team, I was like, well, this is great. Just let them know what they're supposed to do right. I'm like, okay, you guys go do that. I'll go do this. And then I started looking through the cases and like certain things are being missed. So I know that I can just give these people 100%.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I love that you've noticed that. And so you have Cynthia, right?
00:17:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And she used to be on the rental team. Yeah.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like, one of the things that he learned about her is that she is very systems and processes oriented, like she needs to have structure. Whereas he said a lot of other people that he's worked with, they don't, they're just like, you know, they roll with whatever. But she likes to have the documented, she likes to be like step by step. Do you feel like you've noticed that also or noticed anything about how she works?
00:17:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she is like that. But now she's a little bit because for like a good three months, it was just her and I. So, and I didn't know I was going to get other help. So I kind of trained her to, you know, be proactive and not necessarily have to wait for me to task her for every little thing and be like, look, when we get this case, these are the three things that always need to get done. You know, after a month or two, distance to get done. So now she's a little bit more, she's still like very task oriented, but she's still now, she's little bit more proactive where she knows certain things have to get done, no matter what, so.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you consider yourself a leader?
00:18:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm still figuring that out because I'm a really independent person. And like if I was able to, I would just handle all my cases by myself.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you do with is being a leader. What's that? What you do with Cynthia is being a leader.
00:18:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's still hard for me because like, like I work out a lot and I never have a gym partner.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always go by myself.
00:18:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. But she's been, yeah, I mean, I know what I have to do in order to get the team to, like I can be a leader, still figuring it out because like I said, a lot of things in life I would rather just do by myself, but. Obviously, can't 200 cases, when I need to, in college, we had a lot of leadership stuff. We're at like lead teams and trained people. I'm just trying to find how to do it, because obviously here it's like, if you don't perform, then your job is on the line. So I need to manage how I lead them, because eventually it's on me, right, if the team makes a mistake. So I need to kind of control and not be too harsh on them to the point where they're like, you know what, just go work somewhere else. So it's like a balance between, okay, we need to like fix this, but not talk to the team in a way to where it kind of ruins the dynamic because, you know, conversation, and they'll always remember that. Um, so that's kind of how many jobs have you had in your life?
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Real jobs or any job. Like I had a newspaper route when I was 11, I worked in the fields and dug two lip bowls out of the ground and my fingers were bleeding by the time I was like 10 o'clock and I was 11 years old.
00:20:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I was weird, but I worked, I cut grass, I babysat, I did like all of those jobs.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they all shape us. So tell me about your work history.
00:20:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I used to work at a grocery store before law school. And this is my second job.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So how are you? How much time did you spend there?
00:20:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Three months?
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three months? Yeah. So what did you do?
00:20:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like did you play sports? Yeah, I played water polo and swam in high school.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was a different. Swimmers are different I'm trying to I'm trying to profile you.
00:21:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, the biggest thing is like the gym like that's like my my baby so That taught me a lot of lessons.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um Do you compete?
00:21:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't but People would think I would the way I treat it, you know Are you an only child? No, I have an older brother How much older two years?
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're the baby Okay, yeah, just taking so do you feel like you've had much for opposition and life?
00:21:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um Probably not But those are a lot of times those were because of the things that I did like Like I worked my up in school to Fast the bar on the first try for example I could have been an opposition if I failed and I got away another year to take it and things like that So I feel like I do the right things to minimize the amount of like hurdles because I don't like when things get postponed or I Don't know I'm just very that's why you don't like working with other people because most people don't show up like that, right? Um, I mean the team's been really good so far.
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't really know. Let's just talk about the team I just talk about you in general like all the way up through life because you do a lot of stuff by your own So it's definitely not just about your team and and treat law Why does it do you feel like like all you do you feel like you're I don't think you're an extrovert? But are you extroverted introverted or ambivert meaning a blend of both?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
But it just depends what I'm doing like I Work I'm pretty pretty introverted and just come in do my thing and go home but then at the gym I'm looking
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
totally different person like. Yeah.
00:23:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You know, or if like, there's something that I want to fix in my life, then I'm extra vertical because I'm like, I got to get this done or do you have to be around people all the time like to feel and there's okay, so you're an amber bird. I can literally work in a square box and not see a single person for a year and be okay. But I can also come here and like chitchat and have lunch with people like, you know, yeah, it's kind of weird. Like I can really do both.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's that's good. You actually you have a lot of qualities I am very familiar with and they're all amazing. So I don't know that you know that about yourself yet, but you have the potential to do some really amazing things. And the great thing is you should try to stay humble, which I think you actively work on constantly. I think you're probably conscious of that. But there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. But the power of confidence is that you get some things done faster, but also it has energy and it's palpable and it moves people around you. And I think that you have it, but you may be resisting it in the vein of wanting to not be arrogant. Hold on, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm we'll keep our eyes up. I will finish my call and then no, not here and there. You know what, go ahead. She can come. Come on, you're filthy. All right, thank you. you okay now? Okay, so we had a massive flood in our yard. We had an above ground pool that just exploded in the morning and it sounded like worse than any tornado or anything I've ever heard. And so my daughter was out there and she she's 17 and she's going to clean it up and apparently it cleared a little hole in the corner of the fence where her dog could get out and she was terrified that she'd lose her baby and so she was like freaked out and I'm like okay anyway you never know what you're going to get no I've got four daughters and they're all super strong well they're two of them are grown 117, 114 and I have a granddaughter and It's the most wonderful, amazing thing in the world, and it is also the hardest I can imagine in the world. My mom used to always say, I hope you go and just like you. And I was like, well, I got four, so... Perhaps you four is something else. Yeah, and by myself, that's been something else. But like I said, it birthed. It birthed this, and I love what I do because I get to meet amazing people, and they're all leaders, and they're all brilliant, and yeah, yeah, pretty magical. I love what I do. So anyway, back to you, Pat. You prefer Pat. Yeah, not Patrick. I think they're way worse. In the way. Well, okay, so let me look at this time. just kind of think about this. So I don't know. this is... We didn't have a contract. Mark and I did make a contract for how long we'd work. with you, but he's paid for the quarter. So what I would love to do is just, so in the beginning with anyone, and then normally they're seeking me out, not this is somebody else's person that I work with. I do work with teams, but it's not the predominant thing that I do in way that I go about it. But since the quarter is paid for, the schedule that I suggested to Mark was I meet with you, once by yourself, you and Lorenz twice, although we may switch that up and just be do more one-on-one stuff because you will have very different goals. The benefit of meeting together is that it helps uncover some of the commonalities, some of the issues that might be not necessary issues, but what are the processes, what are the levers inside the business that we can do to improve? So like intake, for example, does not have a script that people follow consistently. And because of that, calls are handled differently. And we have figured out some better ways to handle calls, but because there's no script and the process, it kind of depends on whatever mood people are in, kind of mood the calls are in, and that's not the optimal way to run business. So, Mark's competitive too. Mark wants to see Sweet Lock Row, wants to get more cases, everybody wants to make more money, but not burning people out while doing it because life, you get one life, like business is not the thing. Life is the thing. So, figuring out how we can do all the things better and more powerfully in a more leveraged way so that, like I said, I love more from less. So, What I think, I would love to be able to spend time talking to you about just things like Cynthia, we talked about her a little bit. don't know anything about Elsie because she's newer also. And kind of figuring out how you guys work like what are some of the things that you come across. It's really a lot of just, it seems like we're just talking. It's very, it may even seem unstructured. promise you, it's not unstructured. I have been doing this actually for 22 years. So I've learned that there are certain types of conversations and it's primarily PAP. It's primarily probing. So I will ask a lot of questions and sometimes what you'll find out is that the questions made you think something you weren't thinking before. They make you ask your own questions or ask a question you haven't. Ask yourself before and by coming up with that answer, you're just like, Oh, well, I didn't think about that before. So now maybe I could try this. Maybe I could try that. The other benefit because we're doing this kind of as a group inside a sweet law is that as I'm talking to you and looking at things like go to Mark and be like, Hey, you know, Pat was having this experience. I didn't know about this. Can we try this? Can we try that? know, and I see that, but Mark, and I imagine you've figured this out, but Mark loves people. He loves his people. I don't know how he shows up in the office, but the way that he talks about people is, you know, this is like this is kind of his surrogate family. He, he cares like he's not, he cares about to take, like you talked about how you talk to people. He cares about that too. Although I think he's better at it now since talking. Can you me? I'm just going to take a little credit there. Just, you know, just work is work. We're all people trying to be the best people that we can be. And we do better when we can work with people who have some different experience, like you talking to Samantha. That's great that she's supportive and that she answers questions like that. And I think I remember Mark talking about you doing that from the very beginning, just asking lots of questions. Like that's actually also a great sign of a leader there. It might not seem like it because they're going to somebody else, but it is. So goals, that's what we were talking about. Okay, you want to compete with Samantha. Yeah, I like get some of the best case, not necessarily with her specifically, but as far as Sweet Lodge, just be one of the best attorneys. there, put up those big numbers, but also you care about the clients that come in, you want to take care of them. You've got these broad chill shoulders that can take some stress that other people can't take. You've noticed that you've got to be accountable for the work that happens on your team and so that you can't just leave them unchecked to work fully autonomously, but you did try to give them autonomy and but with direction and leadership. All of that is really, really impressive actually. There have to have to be diplomatic and when I say sometimes, so hold on a second. I won't say who and where but in some places, some people just don't care that even in tweet law, there's there's somebody that just those up for paycheck. That affects everybody, because they don't hold the same weight. And that could be in any department. I'm not naming names or anything. But my point is that even just one person like that impacts the energy of the firm, impacts the trajectory of the firm, and it takes a really long time to hire anybody. In the three years I've been working with Mark, I think we've hired maybe three attorneys, and he constantly has ads out looking to hire people. It's just really difficult to find good people in a good match. Not everybody wants to do pre-lit, right? know that. There's a lot of different things that people are looking for. when he's got somebody, he wants to take a care of them, train them, and make the most out of it for sweet love, but also for that person. And me, especially, I'm just mom wherever I go, which is not a professional way to really look at it, but it just is what it is. I was, I was born a mom, I was as a kid taking care of everybody and like, can I feed you? can I do for you? Um, so, so that's it. And I feel like you've got some mad potential actually, and it's really exciting because I've been watching sweet love grow. You know, I've, I've heard, um, some that Cynthia's had some struggles and to know that there might be, but also that she's great, that she's nice, you know, that she's a good person. So if there's somebody that can help her grow and, and be better and be able to be even more valuable, then that's amazing. And that makes you even a greater asset. So I would love to talk to you about just leaders. ship and optimization. different ways that like you've noticed, there are some things that have to be done. Like, so one of the things that I know sometimes calls just don't get followed up with consistently enough and the ball gets dropped there. And you know, if the cases age out too long, sometimes we've missed things. We're not we're not getting those. For the life of me, I can't tell you how many times I forget that word. And I know it. Yeah, no, when we don't when we don't get the backs. It's the benefits, but it's that's not the word. Yes, thank you. I swear there are some words in my brain that just are never want to come. Oh my gosh, and the most random ones and inappropriate ones. Sometimes we'll come and have the right ones. Anyway, policy lemons. Okay. Well, let me turn it back. Yeah, so not following up with things consistently and also like, again, on the intake side, not asking some of the right questions and then we find out that they've already talked to another firm or that they haven't gotten to a doctor and the case is too old, know, like there's all these different things that impact the likelihood of being able to do well and get our money because at the end of day, it's also a business like we're here to help people, but we got to help the team first by making sure we can stay in business and do good. So all of that. But I think that you and I talking together. Now, it's not a, wow, amazing. I can't believe this thing happened. You know, we don't have conversations like that. What happens is it's like working out like if you lift and you follow a regimen for years, sometimes some of them like you can, you can beef up fast. but some of them are like you just look six months later and you're like dang like I'm a little more cut and or I can I'm not tired anymore or these joints don't hurt anymore or like this this you're so young you probably don't know these things but yeah I'm injury free thing going you don't you don't know I'm 40 so I'm about to be 48 so like I know about these things I'm sorry um weightlifting is life for me I don't go a lot but it literally but I go consistently all the time and it's it's life like I'll never quit I'll be a hundred in a gym I don't care I'm like I'm not gonna have all that old dick crub and stuff happening anyway so um but I think that if we focused just on because I think that you're already you may not do you feel like you were interested in leadership like consciously
00:38:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like naturally I'm just like better off as like the grunt like just have me do work and I'll crank it out. So not naturally like seeking out leadership roles, but I feel like here everybody has their own little team and it's cool that way because I get to manage it and it's not like I know a lot of firms. It's like case managers just bounce around like whoever needs to grab want to do this, but for me or here it's like your team is your team like they don't just go work for somebody else for a week and come back. So it's cool because I can obviously I need the help right so I'm going to do what I need to do to make sure that everyone here is like working good and they're happy and so it's cool in that regard to know like when we have like a really big mantra. whatever that, you know, the team did it. at the end of the day, if I'm managing them well, then those numbers mean that, you know, as a leader, you did the right thing. Which is cool because if I go out and go do something by myself, that's great. But if I was able to do it while managing four different people, obviously that takes a lot more work. So the reward is like, wow, he did this and was able to manage all these people. And it's like more responsibility. But it's cooler when, because I know like if I'm just by myself, I know what I can do, but I've never had to really manage people. So that's like the new test for me. Which is cool like when it works out. But you like it? Yeah. Now, if I have like five people then, I don't know. But before we got into the group and we're doing good. So I'm gonna have the smallest team because I don't know. The biggest case load, but like months where we beat the other teams is like cool, you know, because it's like the three of us or when it was just me and Cynthia's like the two of us were able to beat the team of five, you know, yeah, but things like that keep me competitive. Like, you know, the mitigation guy, but he only has like Nick, really love. Yeah, really a lot of cases and he was beating me for the attorney's fees this month, like Mark sent it like a couple days ago and like that pissed me off. I was like, what's Obviously, if you get like a big case, big numbers, but And that's the ones that go to litigation anyway, so Yeah, they're kind of predestined to be higher numbers anyway. Yeah, but still.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll just tell you one thing, though, is Don't compete with people playing a game you don't want to play. You don't want to play a little game. You don't want to play litigation, so like, don't compete with people playing a game. You don't want to play. don't want to do that. It just, it gets in your head. You know what I mean? Gun from the people playing the same game as you. Because you just get tripped up. You take your eye off the ball and that becomes a problem. It creates this internal dissatisfaction that can't be corrected because you're not playing the same game. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:41:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I get that, but you're not playing the same game at all. You know that, right?
00:41:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, if Mark sees it that way, then I'm cool with it. But as far as I know, could ask him, you can ask him.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's the numbers and it was last and that's all he was saying. litigation and everybody else is 100% completely different. And I know because I've been talking to him for three years. And we look at the numbers and we don't even talk about Nick and the litigation team. It pretty much is isolated and honestly That's my bad. We probably should talk about it more, but that's it's not because what what really? Mark see sweet lot as a pre-vit firm period and the story litigation is only there to serve a necessary You know thing. It's a need we have to have an outlet for it. There's money on the table We're gonna take it, but Nick is playing a different game that Mark's not even really interested in playing It's just part of it. You know, you know I'm saying. So I You know you could talk to him ask him out right because Mark I think is pretty open about stuff too And if he tries to evade the answer cuz he does do that sometimes pin him down and be like wait look I like for real tell me Um, you said we're not planning to say gay That way like put it on me. I don't care. I'll be scapegoated all day long. I'm built for it. So Yeah, so the question really was like, do you see yourself as a leader and what I see is that you're still evolving and defining how you see yourself. You really just getting started in the professional world. And, but I would tell you, Pat, 100% you've got innate natural leadership qualities. And you may not be seeking them out. That's, that doesn't mean that that's not what you are. A lot of leaders don't. There's different types and, and it has a lot to do with the extroverted introverted type of thing, right. But some of the best leaders in the world were there because everybody else said, look, we need that guy because first of all his ego is not going to trip us all up and get us in trouble. It's not going to send us to war like Mr. somebody with their orange hair, but you know diplomacy whatsoever. You know what I'm saying, like, so. So, there's different types of leadership, here's where it's just natural for you. see a problem, and you say, like, you see yourself as, I just the grunt, and I just want to knock it out, but that's leadership stuff. I see that there's work that has to be done. I'm going to do it. That's a leader. You know, even if you're only one person, you're a leader of one, I know you've seen enough people in life to know that there are people who won't even steward themselves and manage themselves, right?
00:44:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, percent.
00:44:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. and there's a lot of those, right? Yeah. So, you not only will take care of yourself, but you see that, okay, I've got this thing that I'm a steward over now, this little pod, this little group, and I was trying to give everybody space to let them do their own thing, because I like to do my own thing, but then I realized they're not doing it well, so I'm going to help them. I'm not going to browbeat them, and I'm not going to hurt their feelings. I'm just going to show them how they can be better so that we can be better. Dude, that's leaders all day long. That's like good leadership all day long. So I would like you to just kind of ponder on that. It doesn't mean you need to go seek out leadership opportunities. It doesn't mean that you need to see yourself any kind of different. But knowing that first of all, it helps the people that you do have stewardship over it. Like I said, there's an energy to it where, and I would bet you anything Cynthia already feels this and else you do. It's Elsie, not Elise, right? Yeah, Elsie. They just are like, Pat is doing his job. Pat is watching out for us. Pat is going to help. Because you have that calm energy, but it's also strong and it's also smart. And people, especially women. in work and probably in lots of places are going to feel safe there, but when you're also giving them the skills and empowering them, you're going to find out I'm telling you this because it'll be important. There's going to be a lot of ways that you can compete and you can win because you'll be able to activate people that other people won't be activated because they'll want to work for you. They'll want to do their best for you because they don't feel afraid and they know that they're supported.
00:46:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I could tell you I might be wrong, but I'm almost never wrong about this stuff and I only say almost just to be humble, but I'm never wrong about this stuff. So watch, but people will want to work with you throughout your life. know you don't know where you're going to be, how long you're going to be there, I really want you to hear this and take this with you because you'll see it showing up in your life that you can get a lot out of people because they feel safe with you and because they know you'll do the work. That's another thing like a lot of people are told what to do by people who have no food because they're not doing it. They've had terrible leaders, terrible bosses. When they get somebody who's in the trenches with them doing the work, who knows what they have to do and appreciate it, they'll show up at a whole new level. So talking about leadership, there are two books. you like reading and all or listening to audiobooks?
00:47:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't want to have you do things. I'm never really trying to read at least when I can.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you like podcasts?
00:47:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's more tolerable, yeah. I think I've read maybe one full book in my life. Like as a kid, would be reading and I would just like read the same line over and over my mind would just be somewhere else.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you didn't lost.
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I would like to go reading.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ADD?
00:48:17 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't sitting there flipping through pages.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you don't listen to them either though. So it, um, do you, like, do you watch a lot of movies? Or you just like hit the gym a lot like, uh, I watch movies.
00:48:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was the same movie like over at all. I for sure don't have ADD. I just don't like, I just don't like to read.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, now this is me asking because like I said, I'm trying to profile and understand because if I try to get you to do stuff that you don't like and don't want to do, then that's just not going to be good. So what I can do is just kind of distill some of those things that I think would be useful for you. Some people like to and they get a lot out of it. So my approach with you would be, let me go refresh my memory on some of the books and talk to you about a couple of things. But the principles of, so there were two books I would have recommended. One is called multipliers and one is called essentialism. And the thing about multipliers is just kind of basically something I think that you do innately and that is look for people's strengths and abilities and just help them tap into it, support what they have to do, and then give them the freedom to do it and what you described was doing that with Cynthia. So it would basically be the purpose of reading it would be to see maybe the other applications and also so that you had a greater awareness of the power of what you're doing, but it's not, it's not necessary to read it. And then essentialism is just, there's a lot that gets done, and this would be towards the processes and figuring out, you know, where is there anything that's happening that's being done that doesn't really need to be done, are things being prioritized so that the most important thing is getting done day-to-day to push a case to where it needs to go, right? Every day, there's lots of phone calls that have to be made, right? There's lots of contacts, there's lots of information that has to be gathered, whatnot. So making sure that the most important things get done first, that drive the needle forward, sometimes that's not what people do, sometimes they just take the low-hanging fruit, like this is the call that's in front of me right now, this is the case that's in front of me right now. instead of maybe triaging according to their value, their likelihood of getting close, how good at communicating the client is and you know there's all kinds of different ways to kind of evaluate what's the thing that should be done first at the beginning of the day and throughout the day and so on. So but if we have some conversations about that at minimum for the next three months because that's what's being taken care of and if we talk about you know what your goals are what I'll do is go and solidify to and make sure that I've got some numbers for you to take a look at and compare it to what you're looking at already and see if I've got any more information than you see how I can help you be like okay this is your trajectory this is what you're doing um across the board in terms of so there's attorney fees which is our really the staple number that we're looking at. But there's also how many cases, there's also how many cases get closed, like the pace that they're getting closed. And obviously, you guys can't control when it's resolved and you get paid out, but we can't how long it takes to get closed. So just looking at those numbers and giving you kind of one-on-one insight into that and a little bit of a different perspective, then let's say Mark would have, I think that it could be something that would be valuable for you.
00:52:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Are you interested in that at all? Yeah, because I mean, the numbers and stuff is like just puts it right there and you can see everything. So I like the numbers because it's just easier and I understand like what's lagging or what's doing good. Yeah. And it's like a motivator, like when I see the numbers, like, I like the numbers.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to, the only reason I'm not going to do it right now is because I have to ask Mark, you know, I'm able to share and look at, um, just got a new, uh, report also, which is the best one that we've had so far. So let me look at it. When did you start again?
00:53:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
November 1st, 2022.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy cow, it's been not long already. Geez.
00:53:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Well, the first year was just like a blur.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we'll, I don't want to do last year. do equals this year. That was free by team. Yeah. For the year, I still don't know what I'm allowed to say. So I absolutely. Okay, that cannot be right. That one has to be wrong. That's the other thing. As our report is, it's in progress. And so we got to validate it, make sure that it's pulling the correct data. Because like it's saying, Nick's team for the year is averaging 1.8,000. And we know that that's not right. For an average of chummy fee. So I will, it's definitely wrong. But you're up there for sure. are in the game. And for being so new, I think that's something. Let me look at cases closed. For the year. That's interesting. Yeah, I just want to make sure these thumbs right. So I'm going to see what I'm allowed. to share and I'll check with Mark because I think that what drives you I think seeing these numbers would be huge for you and I think watching the numbers change would be huge for you and then some of the other things I'd like to do is talk about L.C. and talk about Cynthia you know how they're doing any patterns you might be noticing good or bad like I definitely want to know about good and in terms of the bad like we're not here looking for how to fire people how to get rid of anybody anything like that we're 100 percent here for how do we make everybody better and feel safer enjoy what they're doing more sort of the clients better and just just improve everything so I think it's really important to because sometimes people come in whatever and their agenda is how do we weed things out that's not what we're here for at all. Yeah, so that's what I'd like to do is just have some conversations. And the other thing though, Patrick, is like I was saying is that what happens is I'll ask questions and they kind of reveal other questions and lead to the next questions. So what I would be interested to know is if you, I would love for you to just take a little time and think about the conversation we've had today and see if any thoughts just kind of pop up that maybe hadn't before or they had that maybe you hadn't done anything with them. And if you're willing to, like, I would imagine you're not really a journaler.
00:56:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you want me to like think of a set of questions?
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, just kind of like, if you have a thought that you notice that was a result of this conversation, um, read it down and it doesn't have to be super in debt. That can be a bullet point, but it has to be written enough so that when we talk again, you'll remember and be like, wait, what was that about? Because I'm terrible. I'll write something down and be like, I can't even remember what I was thinking when I wrote down. So I just needed to be thorough enough that you could come back and go, yeah, I was thinking about this. Or like, if you're working and you're watching things going, you know what, I noticed this and I hadn't really noticed this before, because that's kind of all part of the evolution. But what that will also help me to do is know how your brain works, how what you're what you're kind of patterned are, because again, this is to be customized around you, like imagine, I don't know if you're like a Marvel dude at all. Which one? Marvel? Nope.
00:57:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
There's like a million characters.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Well, if I say Marvel, most people might say, are you a Marvel person? They're like, yeah, yeah, but like, just anyway, imagine you're Tony Stark, and we're building an Ironman suit, but it's just for you. Like his suit was built. for his strengths and for his weaknesses and for his mission, like what he was trying to accomplish. He kept trying. He kept iterating his suits, right? He had new versions because he's like, well, this one didn't do this. So I needed to do that. So my process is basically trying to build your perfect Iron Man suit. Like you're already great. Tony Stark was already brilliant and amazing, right? He was pretty powerful just as it was. But with the suit, you know, that was like multiplied many times over. So the goal here is to be like, what's amazing about Pat? How do we amplify that? And so it comes through probing, learning experiences. So everything that you think about and everything that you just kind of notice and observe, bring that back to the drawing board with me and go, okay, I can work with that. Let's do this. Let's try this. type of thing. How's that sound?
00:58:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I'm really open. I won't shy away from any questions. You have so pretty, like if you're asking something, I'll just tell you what it is.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, my goal is to help you hit your goals. Yeah, it does, it does, it does. But the energy with it, like I want you to come with your competitive side. want you to come thinking, all right, we are gonna figure out how I smoke these balls. I'm like, we're gonna figure out how I beat this list is like we get, we get all the cases and we get the best attorney fees and everything else. Like, that's the goal. But while also being a good guy that doesn't hurt people, that's not like plowing through people just to get to where he's gonna go, that you're doing that, that your team's winning, that they're getting higher bonuses, know what I mean? That incentive program is good, you know, and there's a way to help everybody. Like you could be the guy that helps everybody get paid more. And I think that'd be awesome. So. So I want you to think about that like, okay, I've got kind of this silent partner over here is going to help me win even more, but it's not just you winning. It's your whole team winning and it's all a sweet while winning. So, you know, think about it like that. then read anything down that you have. And we'll figure out, we got to figure out a time next week. You already told me what can work for you. I'll see. I have not heard back from Miranda. So let me check with Mark. See if we can get something on the books for next week for two of us. And then, you know, it's really fluid in the beginning. It's kind of awkward in the beginning, but it gets some legs on it and we'll get we'll get a flow. All right.
01:00:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So next week is not scheduled yet.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I, it's supposed to be you, me and Lorenz. I haven't heard from him yet. So. Will yeah, I'll follow up with you on that.
01:01:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's okay. Yeah, I mean, any time works for me like Monday mornings. It's just like Class of a waiting all weekend to call and select a little bit push, but Afternoons are probably best Okay, we can do that.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told me like any day after like at three or later one or or three any day at three I think you said Yeah, I prefer not to be that late I like to be done with calls by like two o'clock, but Monday's different because I started 10 and then I've got back-to-back calls until 130 so like two or three on a Monday would be perfect three o'clock on a Monday is perfect Because I keep a lot of the other days up and just for the actual work and not the beatings But I do need to get with Lorenz, but for you and I we can make it Mondays at three When so the one one once a month that it's just you and me so far we can do that so like a month from now same time we can get that on the calendar and then if you have any questions if you have any thoughts and be like you just want to shoot it out before you're thinking about it I would love it in real time rather than waiting until we talk again because then my brain gets to start working on it because I keep a small roster and I'm thinking about everybody all the time it's just the way that I work like this is my little team and I'm thinking about like wonder how Pat's doing like checking his numbers like how's things going and so if any thoughts come up I would just love it if you just shoot an email and be like hey I was thinking this okay I can do any questions um no I'm actually excited for this people about my thoughts and stuff so this is
01:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
different, you know, but I'm open to it, you know, Mark mentioned to me that obviously there's a value there, so I'm always open to trying because I trust him and um what he thinks is worth it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good to know. I'm really glad you shared that with me because like you're little stoic over there and just trying to read you and not give enough a lot with that poker face.
01:03:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This isn't me though, like so maybe I'll, I don't know if I'll open up, we'll see. It's kind of natural, it just happens. Yeah, it does. But good thing is I listen to everything you say, so don't think like this guy's bored out of his mind, it's just like, I'd rather just like when it's time to listen, I'll listen when it's time to talk, I'll talk to the thing. So don't be put off by it, a lot of people are like, well it's better than showing the emotions, like I listen to everything he's saying, you know, so.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will learn that too in, in the way that you should. and the conversation. thank you. That was really helpful to me. So now I'm really, I was already looking forward to it. I think you're going to do amazing, but I want to serve you well. Like I, you know, that's what makes me happy. So I'm looking forward to it. I've got somebody knocking at my door. I know my daughter needs me. So I'm going to go and I will follow up with the pool. I know. Thank you, Pat.
01:04:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I hope you have an amazing day. You

Can you hear me?
00:00:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
How are you, Tina?
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm hurting today.
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
You're tired.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm hurting.
00:00:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I'm in pain, but.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a girl thing. Do you daughters?
00:00:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I have one, and I'm married.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, I got the woman thing, having daughters is, I've got four daughters, so it's been fun. It's been fun. But my brain is kind of struggling today with the paint. Okay. And I'm dehydrated. fun times. get my notes open. Let's see. So, let's start with how, so we talked about some things last time, and I always like to start with, have you had any thoughts, just kind of that happened as a result of it, things that you might have been thinking about since the last time we spoke?
00:01:23 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I think one of the things that you brought up earlier in the meeting was, you know, I think you were talking to Patrick, but I kind of took it on as well as start the day proactively.
00:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:01:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Do important things first, and address fires after, and so I, you know, it, so I've been out since Thursday and came back yesterday, so I've only had really like one day issue. Yeah, to do it. But I've kind of been instructing my team. Every time we meet, I kind of digest what we talk about. And then I try to, like, any, any good ideas. try to pass them on to my team as well as I've been trying to help them prioritize the, uh, the fires, because some clients, you know, every time they call it's a fire, every time they call they're about to fire us. And, um, it's like, well, we spoke yesterday and nothing has changed since yesterday. So, I've been thinking about that. And then, uh, we, uh, we also spoke about being loud in your mistakes and being able to be. confidently wrong. You have to create a safe space for the people around you. think it's implicit, but I don't know that it's explicitly like something that is fostered in the culture, the firm. I think it's implicit in that, you know, Mark doesn't fire people just for no reason, people go just because he doesn't like it or something like that. But I think like sometimes for people like very who come from pretty traumatizing firms, it's hard to trust. So maybe I need to kind of sit down to make that more sense. that it's okay to make mistakes. I want you to take risks. I want you to, you know, give us ideas that I want you to just be there to get along.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. So that brings up another conversation that could be had, which is, and this is a conversation that I've been working on with Mark, which is, and in a matter of fact, sorry, my brain just jumps around and it comes back full circle, but you should have seen a survey that happened around March, I feel like it happened maybe February, which was in the survey, it would have been, what do you feel represents the culture of sweet law? How do you feel about the culture of sweet law? And what do you think? How do you identify it? So would you remember anything about that?
00:04:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, yeah. I think Mark went through it with the attorneys. went through all the instances. And he was pretty happy about it, because it was overall pretty positive. I think there was one remark about how they needed more snacks in the kitchen.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
But it made me wonder, like, how candid people really are, how much they trust that their answers are not being, like, analyzed to see who they're from. Yeah.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And that's why it's something that I want him to do more often. for example, last year we did a survey. And so it's a practice that we're just kind of working on iteratively.
00:05:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
We talked about that last week.
00:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And not super consistently, not on a schedule, because it is still a small. all firm and there's a lot of moving pieces and everybody has a lot of work to do. So kind of prioritizing how we serve and how we work and it's a work in progress and building the framework for creating an optimized business, which means that we have a consistent feedback loop. But to your point, people have to feel safe to give truthful and useful feedback. Snacks in the break room, you know, anybody could ask for that and how much happier, how much, you know, is it going to improve the quality? Not to some degree, we are human beings and we're pretty simple in certain ways.
00:06:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So feed us like, you can be good, I'm going be happy for a while.
00:06:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be thankful and I'm going to remember who fed me. So you know, it's not that that's not useful, but we really wanted to dig for some of the deeper stuff and looking at the values. So, um, uh, Let me go see if I can find it. I'm sweet. Let's see. Share with me. So, it will be 27. Yeah, survey 2024 responses. that the right one? That's another one. There you go. I was working with AI to try to kind of, there's a lot of information to analyze it, not to analyze like who did it come from, but what was the overall feeling. The overall feeling was really great, though, that they feel like there's effective communication, that there's patience, that there's interesting though. is there were some conflicting responses from the same person. So while we don't know who the person is, we do have all of the answers of one person in one survey. So somebody would say something about, you know, we've got great unity and great team and cohesion. And also, but, you know, I feel like, I don't know, a complaint that contradicts what they just said, which kind of, and of course you could be thinking about different scenarios and different things, the wording of the question, and that's why having conversations at a leader level and creating an environment where your pod and your team will talk to you is actually the most useful thing that we can do. Creating a space where people will really tell us what's going on so that we know what they need, because sweet love will be the best place for everybody if we actually know what everybody needs. and everybody wants. And we can't know that if they don't tell us and they won't tell us if they don't feel safe to tell us. So, you know, it's just this whole kind of circle of things to So what could have the best way to create that?
00:09:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Do I approach them one on one or do I have like a group conversation?
00:09:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So generally, the approach is going to be group wise. The support and the so there's also the coach in private praise and public type of thing. So, for example, let's say you have team meeting and somebody says something that is too critical, right? It's not constructive feedback. First of all, you also want to, you don't just want to tell people hey, you're safe and you can say whatever you want to and nobody's going to say anything because that's safe without a purpose. goal is that we also want to make ourselves those people who can accept constructive feedback. So part of the culture and the values need to be, I'm a person who wants to grow and I want to be the best version of myself. So that's actually where you start is asking and trying to figure out like, how do you feel about personal development? How do you feel about, you know, do you have goals to improve yourself professionally, personally, as the communicator, as a team member, as a person, as a parent, as whatever. Because if that value doesn't exist, all of these efforts are moved. They will placate and patronize, but it will be ineffective. This has to be an intrinsic motivation to want to be better. For the most part, I think that sweet law does a good job of attracting those types of people. There are exceptions, and you can tell that those are the people that basically show up for a paycheck. And there's not a lot that you can do with that except for just create strong guardrails basically. So that they know, you know, if you're here for the paycheck, this is what you got to do to get the paycheck. But just so you know, our culture is we're here to be the best that we can be as teams, but also as individuals. And so if you want to enjoy being here, if you want to stay here a long time, then, you know, consider getting on board with these goals and these values. And here's why you might want to do it. Here's here's the reward for it. at the end of the day, there are people who are intrinsically motivated and driven and there are people who are not there only externally driven. Those really aren't very common, honestly. people have intrinsic drive, but they don't necessarily, first of all, even have a consciousness of it. They don't know what their own motivators are. They've never contemplated it. They don't have anybody mentoring them and guiding them. So, it starts with the conversations and just awareness. And from that sparks questions, which return answers, which generally spark additional questions deeper. And it's a series of just probing, gathering information, analyzing the information, adjusting the trajectory and where you're going based on that information. And then probing again, and it's an iterative process ongoing. but those are the types of conversations that will lead to most of it and it starts with kind of assessing who do you have on the team and what drives them. Let me this creating a safe space for VRE. So you have me go back to, let me switch my create one for just you and yep that'll be sweet. So I have a tab manager and I have different sets of tabs for each of my clients. So they automatically opens up all the things that I'm working in.
00:14:05 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, that's nice. Like 42 tabs open right now.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's half of what I generally have open on each of them. It's called, it's, uh, why did it just go away? I know what it's called, and it's actually just hit itself for me. Let's work Ana. So W-O-R-K-O-N-A for Chrome, and you create these workspaces, and you can save all kinds of tabs. That way, you don't have to use up all your browser memory for it. So anyway, if you don't want to have things slow down. No, not doing that. I just want to open. Okay, here we go. And now what was I looking up? I forgot what I was looking at while I was going to. My notes, very, Oh, I just wanted to get to my house. That was a patch, but I think it's Oh, the team, sweetheart attorneys. It's the name of my spreadsheet that has everybody. So, I know you have Cynthia. Unless I have to look at it. No, I have a very in John. Right. I took Cynthia.
00:15:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I used to have some gestures with Patrick now, and then I have. Jessica and Mike.
00:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike. All right. Oh, here we go. Finally. Okay. Oh, wait. Varian Johnson?
00:16:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Because you said that and then my brain went anyway. So, and then Jonathan and Jessica are the primarily Spanish team?
00:16:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Uh, Mike and Jessica are our Spanish speaker.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I gotta put these together. So, I just have it as case managers and then assistance.
00:16:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, and Mike is also a case manager, I guess. And so, but Jessica is a primary case manager.
00:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
It's complicated.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see that. All right. Let me put this here also. Sometimes Google Docs add new features and I don't know that I've added it until I see it and it just did that. Okay, so, okay, now, let's talk about this. long has, I mean, so you've been with Sweet Wild like two years now, has it been two years?
00:17:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
At the end of the month.
00:17:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Let's just kind of go down the path of how your team grew when you got each person.
00:17:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yes, so I started with Mike and Jess and then Mary asked me to see if I could find someone that could work in addition to them in Arizona. Yeah, and so. I got John who was working with me at Zane's last law firm and so we had a you know three men, four men team for a little while.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long has Jonathan been there?
00:18:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
It's been a little while now, right? Yeah, he started like a month after me. That's September. And then eventually we got, see, we had it sold for a little bit and then she transitioned Tyler's team and then we are our cases just exploded and so we needed a fourth person and so we got Cynthia. Did we have someone before Cynthia? No, we had Cynthia. And then last Christmas since I just wasn't working well within the team, she just she just had a really hard time with John. So she transitioned to Patrick's team and then we got someone else I think is Mary Selah. Now we have someone else before that she like had to have a surgery and then she never came back never heard back from her and then we have Mary Selah her husband had surgery and she couldn't take enough time off at the time and so she decided to go take care of her husband and then we got very two or three months ago.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so let's talk about your team a little bit. So let me, let me kind of plan this out a little bit. I know structure and prioritization is what I wanted to talk about, but I also need to talk about the team. Just dig into them a little bit more and who they are and how they do. So Jonathan and Jessica, wait no, Micah Jessica is who you had from the beginning, right? So can you give me a brief rundown of each of them?
00:20:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Sure. So they're, they're kind of like my most experienced. case managers they're they're separately sure yeah yeah let's start with Jessica she's been here the longest she generally you know generally speaking she is she's very like self-motivated she she transferred to working from home because she moved from California to last year and it's been going pretty well you know there's she's very good her strengths are on she communicates she's very good with clients she has a very good soft touch with clients she's able to communicate things very clearly to them she's very experienced so she knows how to answer most of their questions and she has a good touch with providers as well link me with providers in the clients so So that's been her primary job duties. Lately, it seems like a lot of clients are almost set with her because she's not getting back to them. And so I've been trying to find ways to talk to her about, because she says, well, e-mail them. was like, well, the e-mail's not unlitified. So I can, I know what you've e-mailed them. And so she's like, oh, well, it didn't make it through to litify. And I'm like, OK, one time, that's fine. But this is the fifth one that somehow doesn't upload to litify. So I think there's a little bit of, she's getting married in three months, I think. So she might be a little bit distracted. And she's worked, might not be the most important thing in her life right now. So, but generally speaking clients really like her, she's getting a lot of five-star reviews and her cases usually, you know, they move through pretty quickly. The one thing I would say with a Jessica and Mike team is I'd like to see more policy limits in their cases. Sometimes I feel like, okay, this case is ready for demand and I look at the case and you know, they have Cairo and MRI's and then there's no PM recommended and I say, well, why was there an OPM recommended and they say, oh, well, it looks like the Cairo wasn't interested. So like, well, can we just kind of do a console to the PM and be like, oh, yeah, hadn't thought of that. You're my most experienced CNC, like, if you don't think of it, who knows. So, but that's, that's just, Mike, I think when I got initially, I was warned a lot about him that he would need, he would require a lot of supervision, a lot of following up. He turned out to be kind of a superstar, honestly. He was, you know, when I got him, you know, he was pretty, just kind of floating and just happy to just be there. And not too ambitious. And then I realized pretty quickly that, you know, he likes money, he likes making money. And so he likes numbers, he likes money, you know, not just money going to him, but he likes money going to the firm. And so I was like, well, do you want to help me out of distributions? And so he started, you know, some distributions, like I showed him how to do it. And then, you know, he wanted to do all the distributions for the. Jessica and Mike team and ever since he started doing them, I haven't had to reduce my fee partly ever. Whereas before, clients would have an opportunity to speak to me at distribution time and they'd be like, you can reduce the fee, it's not fair that you're taking it home more than us and try to explain that, well, you have a part of the values of treatment and all that because they're speaking to the attorney, they know I can lower the fee, but now by adding a layer, by having him speak to Mike first, it's a lot harder for them to negotiate the fee where they know Mike doesn't have that kind of authority to lower the fee for them. And Mike is very straight forward, he just tells them, look, this is basically what it is, this is a really good result and, you know, he's like, a magician, he just gets them to sign and then they'll they'll write him a five-star review, know, within the next three minutes, even though they're taking home, you know, couple of grand.
00:26:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that is awesome.
00:26:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does Mark know that he's got that kind of skill?
00:26:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In fact, I'm really worried because I'm worried that he's going to Mark and Mary are going to be like, well, let's put him in charge of like this team or, you know, this team's not doing well with distribution. So let's, let's put Mike in a, in a different team.
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to keep Mike, he's like Mike. Yeah. Well, especially because you're the one that got, you found his spark.
00:26:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. But what you really like, I talked to him and it's not like most people really dread those distributions. and phone calls, even attorneys that I've talked to, he enjoys it. He like, this is really enjoyable for him. He the challenge, he likes the ability to calm people down and the ability to get them to really see the value that they're getting. I've been building this customer who sounds incentive structure to where, you know, when they get a distribution, I'll bonus them for that.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I love knowing that you were able to take him and find, instead of him being the problem child.
00:28:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
he's the winner.
00:28:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's, that's pretty amazing. And you, you did something for that. You paid attention and you noticed something and then you put him in the spot to, to bring that out. So good job.
00:28:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, no, I, that's like, one of the things I'm very proud of is, you know, being able to spot him because he was, you know, he kind of shows up at 10 o'clock and takes an hour and a half lunch and you know, it's easy to see him as this, you know, guy who doesn't really care, just young kid who's just there for the paycheck. But actually when you talk to him, he worked, when he's there, when he's at the audience, he works harder than anyone else. He's on the phone all the time.
00:28:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you feel like he, um, because something I've been wanting to dig into more is how many hours do people actually work and put in, um, especially within take because it's really, nobody micromanages and I'm not a fan of micromanaging, I don't agree with it. But I do believe in knowing the stats. And so how much do you think that he is he hourly? He's hourly, right?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
He's hourly, yeah.
00:29:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how much does he work each week?
00:29:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, usually I see, you know, there's not really a way for me to check on that. Michelle would know better, but you I look on the slack when they're active, you know, when their little circle is green and I would say, so he probably shows up around 9.30 between 9.30 and 10 in morning and then he leaves at five, but it takes probably an hour, sometimes little more for lunch. So, at seven hours a day, but in the seven hours that he's there, he probably outworks everyone else on the team who's working eight hours, eight and a half sometimes.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Working or outperforming or both?
00:30:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I think I know what you mean by that. You mean like there's people that are working but they're they're not producing as much.
00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it would be level of engagement, right? So I might sit at the screen and my brain wanders off or I check my Facebook on, you know, like that that's working. But now if I'm here fully engaged in task at all times, then I'm out like I'm I'm really more engaged. I'm out working somebody who's saying, know, same amount of time, we're technically logged in, we're technically at work. But you're, I'm getting, I'm actually engaged at a higher level. And, but, let's say I've got, you know, happy intelligence of this person, and in their 20 minutes, they can outperform, meaning accomplish more tasks than meet hour for hour. So outworking is efforts, outperforming as results.
00:31:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Oh, yeah, he outperforms, I think.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay, that's some good information. Does he seem to be happy, enjoy working there, want to stay there, do you know anything about his goals and ambitions?
00:32:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, I mean, I think we have a pretty good relationship and as good a relationship as you can have with someone you know, mostly meet with on Zoom and he's every time I've spoken to him, I try to have a one-on-one every month. I haven't had one last month, last month was kind of crazy, usually his feedback is pretty positive, he enjoys being there, enjoys the works he does, he likes being on the team he's in, likes working with Jessica, generally speaking and enjoys himself, I know that sometime back this was two years ago, almost when I started working there, I had spoken with him about his future ambitions and at the time he was looking to you know, going back to school for marketing or something like that, but honestly I can't I think he's settled again. enjoys what he's doing. of course, I don't have a crystal ball. can't read people's mind. Maybe he's putting on a show so that he still has that freedom to do whatever he wants.
00:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guess if he does want to go back to his marketing, but he looks pretty There's usually some signs and running on the wall that a person is checking out, like what Jessica seems to be doing, but it could be situational, like preparing for writing or whatever. There will be some sort of indicator that there's a problem, not necessarily what the problem is, but that there is a problem. And so if somebody, you know, if he's showing up and he seems to be happy and his performance continues to at least maintain pain itself, if not improved. That's a pretty good indicator that what he's telling you is true. So, you have one-on-ones with everyone once a month?
00:34:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I try to. Yeah, again, June didn't happen.
00:34:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how important is that to you? And do you know how it's just your people?
00:34:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah, it's kind of my way to keep a near on the ground because I have a team that's one of John here in Arizona, Jessica and Utah. have Varian Mike in California. So, it helps me kind of know where they're at, know how they're feeling, if they're feeling overwhelmed. ask them pretty, I don't just ask them how you do it. ask them, you know, as your caseload, you feel like you have too many cases right now. Do you feel like you're overwhelmed? Do you need me to shift some cases to the other team? Do you think? think, you know, what do you think of the way the team is going? you think we're headed in the right direction or do you think if you were in charge, would you make changes? Things like that. So I feel like that gives me a pretty good temperature of how they're doing, but again, you know, if they're lying, there's no way for me to be able to tell.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:35:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
But I enjoyed it a lot. gets me to, you know, that's how I'm able to kind of steer them in a direction. I think they'll be more successful.
00:35:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you feel like you missed those meanings?
00:35:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I did January, February, March. I don't remember if I did April, I did May, and then do June.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and why did they not happen?
00:36:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
In June, we had, we did a lot more, I think we did a lot more case reviews and so I felt like I didn't want to overload the team with meetings, but at the same time honestly I just got swept away in the end of the month, subtle medicine, didn't plan well enough, didn't schedule far enough in advance.
00:37:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you feel like you come back from those meetings with, um, value that it was valuable that you had that conversation.
00:37:17 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Which meetings the one on once.
00:37:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:37:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I feel like there's value every time.
00:37:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like they feel like it's valuable.
00:37:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I don't know if I would venture into knowing what they're thinking I think. You know, I try to make it to help them feel heard I try to help them feel like this is their time to kind of like address on the issues. Um, but.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often does somebody bring up an issue? Or even just tell you, hey, I like this or I'm having a problem with this or this is frustrating, whatever, do you feel like something like that comes up every meeting? We're trying to get a temperature of, you know, the value of the call to them.
00:38:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Right, I see what you're saying. Yeah, not everyone always has issues, but some issues came up like at one point, we were doing full team meetings. Mark had asked me to do full team meetings every day. And at one point, you know, they voiced that it was just felt very superfluous. Like there's no, not a lot of value in those. And so we restructured that. There is also point time where Jess and Mike felt like their caseload was a little high so I shifted some cases over to the other team. That was back in March, I believe. And there was a, well, this was some time ago now, but back with Cynthia in December, you know, she talked to me about the fact that she had her just a really hard time with John wasn't able to connect very well within, wasn't able to understand his style and that she would rather just have her own cases than have to work with John.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That came about from my one-on-one meetings? Yeah, it was a one-on-one So What I'm trying to get to is, do we need to build a system for you to have these scheduled in as non-negotiable and, you know, fail-safe if it doesn't happen, because the message that you send is that that is not a priority thing, if it's not scheduled regularly, and it's reactive rather than proactive. And if there is a tool or a process or system that you use that generates good results, then it needs to be done consistently. Now maybe it's every other month, maybe it's quarterly, but I think once a month, especially with our remote team, is not too much. you can do in order to have it not be overwhelming, and what is the most amount that a person
00:41:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
consistently. They're all hourly, right?
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's the average? What's the what's the high low over under on how much they work per day? Weekly.
00:41:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Weekly high is let's say 40 low would be 34, 35.
00:41:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so being in your one on one calls last how long?
00:41:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Well, they usually schedule for 30 minutes, but they usually go over.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's an indicator that it needs to happen. If there's enough conversation to be happening that it's going over, there's got to be some mutual need and wants there. So that's a sign for you to be able to read. I will tell you, having worked 100% remotely for 22 years, that's. monthly is not overdoing it by any means. It doesn't matter how educated, how corporate, how higher level it is. That one-on-one time is, especially if it's consistent and they know it's there for them, is going to have higher value. They will know that there's going to be a time to bring up an issue. They will also know that there's a time where they're going to be asked and held accountable for how things are going, if that's what it gets used for. But we know that humans perform better with consistency and with structure. So your job as a leader is to make sure that you provide that. Anything that you have deemed as something worth doing with any kind of frequency needs to be done intentionally. thematically consistently be scheduled, not let's see if I can squeeze it in, or we're overwhelmed and so we're not going to do it all. Now, there generally is a pace to to the cases throughout the year. It's much more consistent now because we're working really hard on the lead generation so that we try to be giving a consistent amount of cases. But, you know, you can look at what people are working on and do your best to move things around and balance out the workload, but at the end of the day, whatever wiggle room you have should be, maybe we can move it from this state to this state on this week. And maybe we can cap it at 30 minutes, but what's not negotiable is we're not not doing it. And you can give. the timeframe of this week, hey, pick a day this week, but but really, it should be a study on the first Tuesday of every month, or second or third of whatever, a specific day of the month, a specific time of the month that is committed to. Now, if somebody is going on vacation, gonna have a baby do it, like all those different types of things that you reschedule for, you don't just not have it unless we're talking about like maternity leave or bereavement, and they're gone for a long time, bereavement is not that long. But anyway, but maybe that's a time where, you know, you do give a little extra time. Other than that, so vacations you know about ahead of time, and you can look at that and go, Oh, you want vacation during this time, that happens to be when we're having our review call. So let's have our review call ahead of time, or have it after, and maybe we'll make it a little. shorter because it's going to be closer to both the either either the first review before it or the one after Depending on where we're moving it right if we're moving it up or we're moving it back Um, but we don't want to not have it what you also can do Is and you can you can try this out, but what you can do is create that framework and kind of replicate it through email only Under extreme circumstances where somebody's going to be gone for a large chunk of time Where it doesn't make sense to just not cancel that one? So what you do is an email version in lieu of and these are the questions that I would ask you um I like to give people an option of sending me an audio message if they don't want to type it up um, so and and With your team attorneys typing writing is probably not an issue, but basically the thing is you you want to create a format where they're going to still be open and share as much with you as possible. So, like if you have a Slack channel, you can say, hey, we're going to go ahead and have this week's, this month's meeting because of extenuating circumstances, right? other time. Otherwise, it's prioritized. We're having it. It's the normal way. I'm going to ask you one question at a time. You shoot me back your response. Then I'm going to send you the follow up. Then what we're going to do is have an equivalent of about 30 minutes of back and forth chats so that we've connected so that I know where you're at, so that you know I care about where you're at and that I'm we're checking in. But basically, you always want to keep that connection and you want them to know it's really important to you, that they're really important to you. But also, you need that finger on the pulse. You need to be able to gauge them consistently. You know, because you can tell people change how they're talking a little bit, plus when you add that how they're showing up. If you ask them, how are you feeling about this, and then you get a pause, you know, there's probably an issue. There's a lot of different things that you can read, and if you're not having those one on one conversations, then you're missing out on that. So I love that you're doing it. I think that you should absolutely prioritize it and make sure it does happen every month. And I would like you to ask them, and you can send it in email and say, you know, this is the reason I have these calls. This is what I would like to get out of it. I would love to know if you find any value in it, and if so, you know, do you appreciate about it, appreciate about it, and is there something you think that we could do better? we Is there there something something do do you would like to see we discussed, like maybe there's a question I don't ask you, you wish I would ask you and give you an opportunity to discuss something that maybe I'm not creating a space for, especially with Viri. So let's talk about her for a minute. Leading the conversation. So now you do, do you have everybody on a group team meeting anymore at all?
00:48:37 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No. I just meet with John and Viri and I'll be with Mike and Jess.
00:48:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the other, they don't interact with anybody else, right? It's just John and Viri and just Mike and Jessica with you, right? No? Okay. All right, that makes sense. So, John and Viri, tell me a little bit about running out of time. That's okay. Quickly a little bit about John and Barry. Let's just do John because I have enough to work with Barry for right now.
00:49:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay. Yeah. you know, John, I knew him at Zane's. Um, we're, you know, we're, we're good friends. Um, he, uh, he's very, very good with clients, very, very good in crisis crises, out fires. Um, generally really, really appreciate him. Um, and he's getting better at doing, getting distributions, not quite as good as Mike. Uh, and so I, I counted like, this is more of an ad hoc thing where I still do a lot of the distributions, but he'll, he'll do a few, And that's fine that you know, I don't mind doing it He Sometimes He he hyper focuses on things sometimes And things that should take like five minutes taken 45 minutes And so Can feel a lot of times like you're stretching through mode Do you have perfectionists? Does he have any kind of OCD? He has he has ADHD And I have a kid with ADHD so I can't get it and My wife has it too It's it's pretty common for them to hyper focus and just kind of get lost in the in the details and so So we've found some ways to manage that. I think I'd like him to test the consistent, know, being able to, like, I'm very much a guy that, like, I have 42 tabs open. I know exactly what's on all the tabs. As soon as I get an email, I respond right away. You know, and I kind of like, that's how I work. I bounce from thing to thing, and then by the end of the day, all those things have been resolved. And John works differently where, like, he can only have one tab open at the time. know, before he gets a phone call, there's a client that calls, he needs to use the file for, like, five or six minutes before he takes the call. And that's sometimes little bit too slow for me. my liking, but I also understand we have different styles, we have different ways of organizing ourselves. And yeah, same thing, he gets lot of five-star reviews, clients love them. In fact, a lot of times I'll be talking to a client and they ask if they can talk to John instead. So that's always a good sign as far as I'm concerned. Wow.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, it depends on what the values are. It's a good sign that clients like him, but for example, 28 years ago, somewhere around there, was working in a call center and we had Apple Computer and Intel and lots of high-tech companies. The people that customers loved the most, made us the least amount of money and generally ended up getting fired. They had poor call control skills. They couldn't focus on what mattered most. People, it's not social. power. We have a goal to accomplish and the thing is the client's goal is to get their money. That's really what it is. But people also, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? They need communication. And if they found somebody who will talk to them and make them feel good, they may call just a chit chat and just the update. If you were to go listen to his calls, you may find that they go up the rails and talk about things that don't actually matter. And that's a coaching issue. It sucks because that's a part of human needs is to have that social connection. Um, but there's a time and a place for all things. So, you know, getting those needs met has to happen. And maybe, but like everything else, sort of, it starts with awareness. And, and then it starts, and then, and then you add in values. So if he becomes more aware that really the best way to serve them isn't to be their buddy and their friend and make them feel happy, but it's to get their case closed and get them the biggest settlement possible, that that's actually the best way that he can serve them and that by taking too much time with each person, he's actually neglecting other people that he also likes and wants to take care of. So just having the awareness and doing kind of that mathematical equation of if there's not like, there's only so much time I have, there's so many cases that I have. If I'm spending so much time on things that are really irrelevant, enjoyable, pleasant, but irrelevant, I don't have enough time to actually get to the things that matter. And maybe he's He's never really assessed that, and maybe he hasn't assessed it in a way that makes him feel better about saying, about redirecting a call. You know, when somebody wants to tell them about their cat that died, or, you know, whatever problem they had that day because it happens. People get on the phone with a compassionate person, and maybe they get a text message that reminds them, I got to go do this, and then they talk about it. And then somebody goes, oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. And then they might ask a follow up question like, are you okay or whatever, and you open a door that needs to not be opened.
00:55:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Yeah. Yeah, I think when I was at the public defender's office years ago. They said there's like four types of attorney, there's like the, the warrior, the, you know, The advocate, and then they forgot what what all they are, but one of them is a social worker. Yeah. You know, go knock on your door to make sure you're okay and, you know, find a babysitter for your cat while you're in jail and stuff like that and that's, yeah, it's not as helpful as might think.
00:56:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and then that goes back to what is the end goal and what is the priority. So, we have the word priorities as a plural now, but when the word was first created, there was no plural. It was just one, there's a priority, a single primary goal. So, having conversations like that might be helpful. And I think you have the soft skills to be able to kind of massage that conversation. And because, first of all, it takes time to make change. That's a personality that, you know, are habits that are ingrained in his personality. And so to go against that would be to violate his internal values. us. He's taught that he actually has conflicting values, which most of us do and aren't aware of it. The conflicting value would be I want to take care of this person. I want them to feel good, but to take care of them, I need to get my job done and ask these questions and get them to answer them because I also want to take care of these people. And when I talk to them about things that aren't related to the case, I'm actually failing to serve them in the way that I want to. So is it being their friend of the higher priority and being friendly, or is it serving them to the best of my ability, meaning getting the case resolved at the highest level possible, and is it timely amount or is possible?
00:57:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
So I'm thinking about maybe asking my how many cases he touches each day. And kind of seeing and asking John the same question and seeing if we can move them out so that. Because another thing is he's been requesting a lot of over time to catch up.
00:58:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm wondering if that's the reason why he needs to catch up because. Oh, John is asking you for time to catch up so above like 40 hours like what do you mean.
00:58:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I don't approve anything Mary does but usually asked for like six or seven hours on Saturday.
00:58:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you think it's been trying to milk things so he can get over time.
00:58:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No, I don't think so. I generally think he needs it to catch up. will just jump. 41.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Let's keep working. I as we go.
00:59:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I know we need to wrap up, but. Right.
00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time flies. That's a good thing though. That means we're getting some good work done. So, Viri, I don't want to jump the gun, so I don't want you to go have a conversation that you're not ready to have, but I think you can. And basically just kind of feel it out. I think you have enough awareness in you to direct the conversation. and it doesn't have to be a big long one. Basically, the change will come as a result of you consistently sending the same message, both with what you say and with what you do. So if you say, this is a safe place for you to talk and I'd really like to know what you think about things, how you feel like there's ways that we can improve. I want to know what you like. I want to know what doesn't work well. I think you've got a lot of experience and but I notice you don't really talk about it much and I feel like that we're under utilizing you or under serving you or both because of that and I'm wondering if maybe you just don't feel like this is a place where you can talk and I want you to know that it not only is it safe for you to do it, but it's wanted and just see what happens, just be quiet and let her kind of go from there. You don't want to just keep beating it down. And then if she ever says anything, that is like, I can't believe you just said that. It's so negative. It's so bad. It's so whatever. have to just be able, and I think that you're, I think you have this ability. I've never seen it, but I would assume you have this very well where you can just go, okay, let me think about that for a little bit and get back to you because that was a lot. And I want to give you the respect and honor to give you an appropriate response. And since I don't, I don't have it the moment, but thank you for sharing and encourage it. Because the first time you say you're safe and she's not, that's done. So one of the things that you have to do, and this is something I do with anybody that matters to me, but my star started my practice with my kids, and they're the most volatile. So it's the hardest, and it's the best way to practice, which is kind of that poker face of they're about to say something, and I know I don't want to hear it, and this is hard, and just like, and they're like, okay, I am not going to react to this. matter of fact, I'm going to drop my voice a little bit, I'm going to get softer, I'm just gonna, okay, okay, okay, I need to talk about this a little bit later, maybe tomorrow, you know, process it, although I can't imagine there's going to be something that's that difficult, but just in a leadership role where you want to have people tell you everything, you have to practice how you respond to it receive it so that if they happen to tell you when you're having a bad day, when you're at a time, When you're hungry, when you're tired, because these are the things that make Tina a bear. Do not want to tell me bad things when I'm hungry and tired. It's not going to be good. So just make it a reflexive response to take a bee and just take it in. And then, okay, I'm going to come back to this and do that. But, you know, for people, scattered, working remotely, different personalities, different paces, different skillsets, all of these different things. But you're still trying to work within a single organization with a common goal. That's no small thing. But, certain things, certain types of systems, certain functions done consistently can help you be able to get the best results. it's knowing your people, it's communicating with them. frequently, having a set of company values. And the company can have pods, you know, within it, right? you and your four people are one, but also you and each are one also, separate ones within, so organizations within organizations. And making sure that the internal values of the pods, the smaller the pod is, the more refined those values can be, the more detailed they can be, because there's less people, right? All of those need to be compatible with the larger company goals of, you know, great communication, being honest, being reliable, caring about the customers, the clients. That is definitely, I think, a value in sweet lies. Most people really care about the clients, and they want to take care of them. I don't think... think everybody does. But I know that Mark cares about that. He wants to be one of the good guys, you know, and he works, and he wants people that work for him that are the good guys. That's unique. That is a unique part of your culture. I think that stands out, especially in the industry, that you specifically are in in personal injury. So, you know, lots to talk about, lots to do, and it's the consistent effort. It's the proactive. We didn't get to really talk about the morning and how you started. But I'm really looking forward to that next week, because I think next week is when we're combined again. So, it should be Monday at 3 o'clock, which I've not scheduled. I need to do that.
01:05:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Let me open up my calendar.
01:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just Let me do this real quick. If I don't do it right now, I might forget. And actually, I'm going to duplicate my gosh, go away. I'm going to duplicate. I'm going to move it to Monday at 3pm is what we discussed, right? Sure. I'm going repeat weekly on Mondays and we'll reschedule as needed. Oh wait. Okay. Good. That's that. So we'll just keep working on it. Now, if you have questions, if you have thoughts throughout the week, if you want to run anything by me or just share something or just an insight, feel free to send an email. We could have a Google Doc that's just kind of a back and forth journal about notes. So maybe you don't want to send an email and just like here's some notes or discussion. discussion points for the next week, you can delineate whether or not you want it to be the one on one conversation we have, or think that it might be useful to bring up with with Patrick. So you can just kind of like run it by him. So we can all kind of, you know, benefit from each other. But we will get into the flow of like that structure. But I'm thinking about you guys all week long. So, you know, if there's anything coming up, I would rather hear about it, or at least make sure that you get it out of your brain and captured. So we don't forget to discuss it on the next thing, because a lot of the time that intuitive stuff just comes when it comes. So if you don't capture it, then you could lose something that was really valuable and helpful. So I do want to make sure that you capture it and shoot it off to me. It's not going to bother me.
01:07:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
I will welcome it.
01:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:07:51 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
Okay, don't that.
01:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay. Well, do you have any questions comments, concerns before we wrap up?
01:07:57 - Lorenz Schuerch (3)
No, that's that's pretty much it.
01:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks for thanks so much. I what I do very much and the people that I work with. So my pleasure and also I don't feel like I hurt anymore. So it was nice talking to you enough that my body was like, hey, that's awesome. I'm glad. Thank you. You have a great day Lawrence. I'll talk to you

00:02:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Pretty good. I What started out, you know, was a pretty bad month Finished off as a pretty decent month You tree above $100,000 settlements. That was good. was, it felt good. The team was definitely a little bit down by, you know, two weeks ago. Everyone was a little bit exhausted trying to chase down some more settlements. Everyone was kind of stressed out and then the hard work paid off. So everyone felt pretty good about them.
00:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Job. How did they feel about the new incentive program?
00:03:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You mean the bonus structure? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they like it. It's just, you know, we have to get the money in to make it money.
00:03:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To qualify? Let me go open. And then if I see the report I want, I guess we'll do, oh yeah, Patrick said yes, all right, thank you guys, you guys are awesome. Well, that's going to be, I'm definitely going to need my brain on that one though, because I have to move multiple, and that's really easy for me to mess up, and I don't want you guys to get a billion emails up, oops, from one, sorry, oops. Oh, what am I going, oh yeah, let's apply. Me and browser taps, Lorenz. Alright, we're reaching to the choir. Equals, last month, because we are in August, refresh. Is that the one I want, I might want a different report. If you were going to go check your numbers, what would you do in Linify?
00:05:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. I keep track of my own numbers on that spreadsheet. I don't particularly like Lidify. I find it pretty clunky. I can use it for what I needed to do. Anything that I want extra I just do for my own with Excel.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my god is a favorite. It's a case of science. That's not what I want. Probably do you want my dashboard?
00:05:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It means reports.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out which one I want. So edit this one real quick. It's not going to be what I Let's see if this one grows last month. Because the reports, I don't want to have to go to multiple reports, so I want to go to one of my dashboards. So, cases, attorney fees, actually, so, your, that's my state, don't want to buy a state, don't want buy team. Cases close my team, I want to add, okay, gross fee by team, that can't be right.
00:06:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I also don't know how often I guess those reports get updated.
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One other good update as soon as I run it, if I hit refresh, which I did. You didn't just get 92,000 and then attorney fees last month, right?
00:07:07 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah, it was the attorney fees was pretty bad.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I think that can't be right either. So drop out subouts. What's other? I have dropped outside the data is two and then other is 30. Oh, 30 of 32 for two minutes. Hmm. Now we choose to. Let me go back to Mark's notes. So $1 million in and settlements $3 million, okay. So I just look at team brands, well I'm just going to click on you that should do it. Let me show my screen so I'll be looking at the same thing. Sure. Okay, okay. I'm to zoom out of my way here. I'll probably shrink this up a little bit so I can see. Oh, what am I looking at? Time period. It's probably for a month filter last month. I want to look at. Last time through. No. I'm not going to. I'm Save and run. Where's there an error? Filter, the friends. Get rid of that. I already have that. Save and run. That won't give it to me, that's not going to do it. I'll do it for this year. It equals this year. Refresh. It doesn't matter if it's my It's gross to turn me face by team. Okay, now we have just you. Which is not, oh, I think I messed up the report. That's okay, I think I fix it. Ummm. It must just be this, nope, I already clicked on a map to get one of them. I'm just going to discard that and go to a different report, see if this will work. I want to see your stats month over month this year. That's what I'm looking for. Let me do that. me go to, let's see, I don't know what matters. I don't want to turn a fees. Turn a fees this month. a fee by attorney. Oh, it's a mark reports. probably can't see it. Oh, that's everybody. I just overlook you completely. I'll see you. Tyler, Samantha, Patrick, Hank. What's this? That's a time of program. All right. What do you, how do you track your numbers?
00:12:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, with an Excel spreadsheet. Can I see what you've got? Sure. So this is how I track my settlements, my money in, I use, basically use Michelle's reports that are in Google Sheets, this is my settlements, I keep track of how many I get, keep track of the other settlements and I have not every month since last August, so I don't the name.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't understand why they're, like, do each of those attorneys, attorneys, have they worked on that case?
00:14:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, The name is just for me. I don't keep track of the name of cases that the other attorneys settle. I just keep track of their numbers so that, you know, I can see where I stand.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are, what are the line items then for everyone?
00:14:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So this is right here. This is my own box.
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's like the cases I settled last month. This is right here.
00:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so then these are these are these numbers represent cases and settlement amounts. Also for them, just not named.
00:14:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I don't, I don't keep track of names for them.
00:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that makes sense. was just. Okay. No labels, okay. So then the totals. And this is settlements, not attorney fees.
00:15:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is July settlements and attorney fees. I have the records.
00:15:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So before we get into that, can we just go ahead slowly go through June, go through each month real quick.
00:15:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Let me just take a peek at what you've got. So this was June. A lot of cases settled, but not a lot of big ones.
00:15:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And your target for settlements is three million a month, right?
00:15:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
For settlements. Three million, that's the firm goal.
00:15:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brown goal. Okay. What is your, what is the pod goal?
00:15:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, I've been setting it up 600,000.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not have one for you guys like on a pod level?
00:16:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No. Well, he's never expressed a specific pod goal. When I first started, he said my your break even number is you need to make $110,000 in fees every month. But since then we've hired new people. So I'm sure it's higher than that.
00:16:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and if it's not, it's going to be. Okay, so July, can you share on me July one more time, please? Okay, and May. And April. Can I see Megan? Oh, wow. Okay, April and March. Okay, December. Do you know how to tabulate across worksheets?
00:17:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I've tried playing around with it and I can figure it out.
00:17:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you mind sharing this with me? We can work on it and do a tabulation real quick? I know I do that. So share it, Tina at ProfitDrivers Inc.com.
00:17:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
See you now.
00:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At ProfitDrivers Inc. Okay. Send that and then I will open it in ScreenShare and then I'll create a completely new tab so it doesn't mess with anything. We just get that. Wait for it to come. wait where are you asking me to log in a Microsoft?
00:18:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Is that a Microsoft thing?
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay see if then should be able to do that because that is my Microsoft account. All right cool. It's in there, I'm going to you Windows on my way zoom. Okay, so we're going to create a new one here and we need this to So do we want tools? No, we don't want tools. want that. We just want average name So then we'll just do the same. We'll take these. I'm just actually going to do this for a minute Okay, so we're that big enough to see. Okay, and we're going to uh we actually don't need any of this oh my gosh can i pick the right thing please all right delete these rows and okay i don't want to delete them yet so i actually want this to be really rent and i want it to here i want it to be average and it's going to be of you that um i think you have to do comma oh let's see you Yeah, that should work, right? And then this comma, that comma, that. So you would just change this formula by adding the next sheet every month. And then that should work. So that's your average. And then we're going to drag these, drag this over seriously. So that's your average. Now we can. Oh, sorry. Hopefully I can delete that without messing with the formula. Let me check the numbers though first.
00:22:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
How does Hank's average $900,000?
00:22:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. now that's when you go double check everything. Did Hank even exist back here?
00:22:38 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was marks that used to be marked. That's fine. Yeah. So we got it. That's the other things. We got to make sure it followed the same formula. So A, B, C, D, E, F would have to be the same across the board. Otherwise we just go and do them regularly. And so this is not correct because you will actually, it might be because I might have done it right. Hold on. So this is A, is B, B, B, B, B. Okay, so, so we can't drag this across. We just have to go do it manually. So you should be, yeah, we can't because of Mark, Nick, and Hank. They moved, and Robert even.
00:23:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, Robert.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you could do this, or if you want to spend time real quick, we could go do this manually. took like a whole minute, I think, for each row, then we'll have that data.
00:23:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Are you okay with that? Yeah, that's fine.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd like to see how I stack up. Yep. Okay, so we got to average, and then you go to the cell that you want. And so this is Tyler's. You want to make sure that we're getting that correct, and then we put a comma.
00:23:47 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they make you the same format every time.
00:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that would be the way to simplify this. If you wanted to create a new one next year or whatever, but this really doesn't take that long. to go through it. You just want to make sure that you're in the correct cell for the correct person to get the right thing. And then after you've chosen the cell, you enter a comma. Oops, there's a space. Don't mess up that syntax. And then put that word belongs and then go to the next one. And we're in Tyler. So Tyler and Samantha are that way.
00:24:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And then now they switch.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So now we're October and I need Tyler. And then November. Tyler is D. Comma December. Tyler is still D.V. Comma January. He's probably that way all the way through it. We're going to make sure Tyler. make sure I missed February here somehow.
00:24:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't have anywhere. You missed February.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I doing? Okay. So April, Tyler, there, comma, May, Tyler, June, and July, May, June, July, and turn, and that should be Tyler. So, now we'll go to Samantha, and okay, so maybe it took two minutes, but still it's good.
00:25:30 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And that's because we're noticing some issues at the same time.
00:25:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
August is Samantha, I just want to make sure, because this looks a little bit, I guess it's just because it's so full on her line, oops, comma, Samantha, to go over to Samantha's Bee, November, I'm to go Samantha's Bee. Let's see, should I get my comp, okay, December, Sam, September, January, my ADD, and I really have to focus the comma, March, Sam. And there's no February, wait, yet January, March, Thank you, bye. I'm on a call. April, Samantha, we have April, so we're now going to May, comma, June, July. You ready for this? That's our average. Yep. And Patrick's and maybe do you want to get these guys yet?
00:27:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're concerned about Sam and Yeah. So now, now let's do a little bit of a difference. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to. Difference between. And. And. And then we'll do Tyler. Tyler. So it's going to be. I'm going to do this. I got to make it the same thing. So it's going to be. Equals. This minus this. And then equals this minus this. So that should be a negative number. This is how much more you are above Tyler on average and Tyler's been around longer than you hasn't he? Yeah. Yeah, Tyler's.
00:28:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, he's been around forever.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was minding her mouth for a minute. I don't do that very often, but I remembered I should. So, I mean, so I want to look at that as a percentage. What percentage of that? So, going to do this equals this. That can't be right. No, so it's it would be this divided by that. And I would just formulate it as a formula, no, not formula, uh, format, format, cool away, whoa, percentage. Yeah, we'll do that. Okay, and this equals that divided by that, and I'm gonna copy and paste special formula normally. So you're 132.6% out of the entire average over since August, so that's that's not quite as bad. She is, she is, she, she doesn't. Now kids, um, she's a workhorse and she is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's not a derogatory thing, but, but she's built differently. And that has to be taken to account.
00:30:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Uh, I mean, no, I, and, you know, I'm, I I'm, I'm supposed to be the nice guy, the, you know, the dad with kids, but I'm pretty competitive too. And I, I have been chasing her for the better part of the last year.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to, let's, let's, sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. This is my brain.
00:30:43 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Please continue. Sometimes I get close, but, you know, it seems like she gets, uh, you know, well, you know, sometimes it feels like, you know, she settled, you know, one month, she settled like 30 cases. I'm like, you know, I was pretty happy with settling 23 cases that month. It's, it's just no matter what I do, it seems she's always like a step ahead, you know.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's other things that we have to look at, but she, she just, I mean, she just, she's exceptional and, uh, but there are other values that get, oh, that's one time I'm on second. Hi. Amazon, her way to get to you. And she's, she's in cosplay, so, um, fun with that. And I'm going to call. That's why she can't to you. Oh, sorry. I just, I can't get it. No, you're, you know what the pollage is for coming up. just want to make sure that you know. I'll see you when you get home. Bye. She picked up from theater council. She'd be fine that she's like and she didn't know she was gonna go dress go pick her up What's our mental name? Miriam who I like that. That's a good good biblical name November Moses's sister Good Am I in December? I'm in December Patrick. See getting my brain back on track. It's a little bit of work Okay, January Patrick That's what I'm doing right December January. That's the right thing seriously March Patrick is coming That's quite a number isn't it? But I know he gets Mark's cases so Yeah Yeah, this is definitely not apples to apples June but it's still in the number so and pretty soon it's going to be more apples to apples June july okay so we do that wait minute what went wrong august september comma comma what did i do wrong here it looks correct oh it is correct okay we're not going to worry about nick is litigation right yeah i don't i don't compare that because that's just out of interest it's not how long this hink even had cases like it's a month and a half all right let's just go I didn't get him in there, so there's the formula. We're just going to not do these guys and they don't even need to be in there because of that. Hank, we're going to drive. Oh, here's my little. Hey, I dragged you. Oh, you're just slow. Okay. Average. And let's see. Hank was June and then comma and July. Okay, so we'll just go ahead and put him in here too. And that way we'll just watch that trajectory because you know you don't want them getting in front of you, right?
00:34:53 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, yeah. I've been watching him. I've been keeping track of him. I've been keeping track of the cases that. He's getting to, why is he getting the broken arm one?
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, that's intake, really, isn't it?
00:35:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think some of it is intake. I think some of it is also like, it's like a slam dunk. It doesn't make much business sense for Mark to like give it to me, and then I don't miss on it where I can give it to Hank, or who doesn't bonus, and then the fee can go straight to the firm instead of part of it going to my balance.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But does Mark, I mean, he doesn't have that much to do with intake, does he? Unless they specifically ask him?
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think he does. I've talked to, a of it event, but who gets the cases as far as thought.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was that before, so I want to ask and understand it again. I'm here to say, I'm here to say something. Yes, but that is something I've already been trying to dig into. So it's not necessarily motivated by the call. It's just this call. It's just like reiterated. I really want to understand that. Okay. So then. I love though that you've been tracking your number. July, July, July was above your average.
00:36:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but not money in. So yeah, it was a good month.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to get a good August as far as fees. Yeah. So let's do that now. What's, let's, I'll stop sharing and you could share your attorney fees with me.
00:36:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, attorney fees, I don't, so I keep track of it through Michelle's reports. So that'll be.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But are those not just monthly or something?
00:37:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's my. Commission reports. Share this with you. Are you. Share. You see that? Yeah. So this is, it's all dated down here. I don't know. All the fees for this year.
00:37:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, oh, that's going to be a lot of numbers to look at, balanced, cover based balance, do balance, do a sweet lot. Can you break this down for me a little bit?
00:38:12 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so really what you're looking at is firm fees right here. That's the money I bring in. This is my commission's right here. And then, so really this is the number that matters as far as like what I think we're talking about.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just for a two week period?
00:38:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So, this is, yeah, two week period at the time.
00:38:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. do you have, do So, attorney fees target is what, and is it by Sweet Law or POD?
00:39:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's by Sweet Law.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what is that across the board monthly?
00:39:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
1 million, I believe.
00:39:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's the 1 million, and then the settlements are 3 million, right, across the firm?
00:39:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you only see your report?
00:39:26 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I can only see my report. I mean, Mark posts them on the week before the end of the month, but he hasn't done it on the last day of the month in a long time, so we don't really know who wins.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know if this is correct. So, let me go look at something really quick, dashboards. That's average, I want to total gross attorney fee by team. Let see manners, manners by owner and status active manners by, I don't miss that we want active principal attorneys to kind of figure out which report. Or look at me attorney fees. Let see if that will turn the fees this month. I should be able to customize that by... So, Mark does show you everybody's stuff is just not at the end of the month, right? Yeah, so it's not up to date. Okay, so then I'm going to take that as the sign that it's okay to look at everybody's fees.
00:41:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you see it, you just don't see. It's just the timing thing. Yeah. So it's not a privacy thing. Okay, so, oops, I almost ended the meeting. Share. I'm going to take over sharing.
00:41:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I'll stop sharing.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay. I'll share... Get these out of my way again. Oh my gosh. Grab the window. That's not the right thing. Okay. So this is for... This says... yeah, I don't want to change this for... It should be last month. This hot-time custom. Last month. Oh, run. Yeah, save it. That's good. Okay, so the runs... that's not right. Wait, so that's not right. That's right. That's what I'm looking for, that's empty. So that's not right. All right.
00:43:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
that's what I don't like about that if I never does what you think it you want it to do. Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's what I need a note to solve. Okay. Let me go back to my notes here. All right, so we talked about scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings for your people.
00:44:16 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, they're coming up again.
00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they're monthly, right? So did you just tell them, hey, this is going to be monthly.
00:44:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is going to happen every single month now? Yeah, so then it's going to happen every single month. If we need to reschedule, we're it right away kind of thing. It's not like push it out to the next month. And I think we, yeah, that's what we had discussed regarding those. And then also set goals with them. And then set goals with them, follow up with each goal. I take notes of their goals and try to follow up with these goals.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So did you create like a call agenda for those things so that you have something just to go through line item by one?
00:45:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have this. I don't know if that's but it's the same format for everybody. It's not like kind of taking notes as they you know ramble on this. It's a bunch about the same format but I I need to digitize it maybe set it to them in advance too so that they can prepare for the meeting so they're not just like uh uh uh.
00:45:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah I think that that would be best because it helps mentally for that exact reason right? It helps kind of anchor them to what the purpose of the meeting is and you'll probably have a more effective meeting if everybody has the agenda even the agenda is the same thing every time, know, out of sight, out of mind kind of thing. Once you get there, now it's on your mind. But you really want them to be thinking about it ahead of time. So they're not searching for the answers. They've been thinking about it, formulating it, putting into the most articulate way so that you can really comprehend what they're trying to express. And maybe just even so they are able to find the words because sometimes you can have a thought and it's kind of ambiguous in your head. know, not really clear, a little fuzzy. So in just a reminder, and maybe it could be something that you automatically schedule. So let's say it's a calendar invite on Outlook and you have a specific invite that goes out to Viri and inside of the invite, here's the notes, here's the agenda because it's the same every time. And just a reminder in the calendar invite. I think in Outlook you can probably as well, how the reminders go out like in Google, can say day before, hour before, whatever, and have multiple ones. So the reminder would show up and it would show the agenda and just reminder, please review the agenda, be thinking about these questions in advance, and then when you get to the call, ask them, did you review the agenda, did you think about these questions in advance? Yeah, because you want them to be doing their part to make sure that the call is and their meeting is as effective as possible. And that is not a second thought, but it is the priority or an afterthought, that's the word I meant. Okay. So, can you read me your agenda?
00:48:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. I write down everything and so I end up with like no books.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is another reason to digitize it with a really clear title so you can find it. Yeah. Because I'm the same way and I've learned that the more those grow, the less helpful they are.
00:48:41 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Yep. And I don't throw them away either. So, I just, yeah. So, first we start with, you know, basically, how are you doing? Well being kind of questions like how you do feel overwhelmed. Do you have any major issues, any stress points right now that we can address? And then we go through the basically stress points from the client's end and then stress points from the firm end to see if there's anything there that we can help relieve. So, for example, Jessica had from the client end, she said, like, forty percent of her time is being spent resolving PD issues for her Spanish speaking clients. And so we talked about maybe at the intake level, we can take a few extra minutes to kind of reset expectations with clients, explain to them where personal injury attorneys were, of course, going to You know, point in the right directions when it comes to PD stuff, but really our principal concern is their injuries and kind of reset expectations so that on Jessica's end she's not constantly resolving PD issues and On the firm and She says it's PD property damage property damage.
00:50:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:50:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Just make it sir Now the firm end Yeah, she had you know, we talked a little bit about how she's she gets really triggered and upset whenever Mark or Mary are stressed out about the numbers and stuff like that Does it feel sometimes like they're disappointed in us a lot, so She's Just gotta try to reassure her that you know mark is kind of like me We we kind of focus on what needs to be improved and Sometimes we forget to say good job, you know, we forget to Be encouraging that doesn't mean you think any less of first. Okay, I kind of reassured her there and then we moved on to the next The next section which is goals what go I asked her to give me goals for the next 30 days that she wants to accomplish and And, you know, Jessica's very like she's like, I want to do better at this and I want to do better at that Okay, but how are we gonna quantify that? How are you gonna measure that? She's like, well You know, I think overall just and I'm like, no, no, no, you need some numbers that can help you keep track of That and another question that you can ask is what does better look like? Yeah, yeah, and I did And I haven't done right here.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does better look like?
00:51:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we said some goals about you know, collecting net, you know, cases that are stuck in collecting meds. And then we want to improve policy limit cases. So one of the big issues we have on our team is that Spanish speaking clients, they just want to get done right away. They don't, they don't care about case value, they don't care about treatment, they just want to be done right away. so we're having a hard time getting policy limits on them. And so we set a goal to get, you know, try to push for 10 policy limit cases in the next 30 days. And then one of the things we wanted was more face to face meetings with Mike or her co team member, feels like sometimes they can't redo the same work. So she wants to have, she wants to touch base with them.
00:52:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then at the end,
00:53:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Did you create a plan for that to happen or yeah, I spoke with Mike And then I spoke to the both of them setting that expectation My the issues I did not follow up like a week a week later to make sure it was happening.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's my family so But we Did you set a timeline for? Okay, so they scheduled it to make sure it's happening. So you'll follow up on the next call and and that will be your follow up So at the very least it's gonna happen within a month. I think it's reasonable because you gave two adults a You're not micromanaging, right? You gave them an assignment They're accountable for it. So, you know, I think that that's I Don't think you dropped any kind of ball by not checking to me that would be micromanaging Did you grown people do what you said you were going to do? I'm following up, yes, following up a week later, whatever, no, you've already built this. That's the whole point of being very consistent about having these monthly meetings is, you know, unless it's urgent, if there's something urgent and it needs to be addressed because it's a major morale issue or a major financial issue, integrity, that type of thing, then you need to really step in because it's not getting handled and the cost is huge, right? The liability of not addressing it is a big deal. But if it's just overall day-to-day operations, the system following up with it monthly and then two things, one, empowering your team and two, setting very clear accountability. So, okay, you guys said you were going to get this started by next week at the late. It is. That needs to be what happens. And, you know, I'll be following up when we meet next to make sure that it happens. But when you do follow up, you know, you can, there's a couple ways to handle it. If it didn't get done. Um, neither one of them have an excuse. So Jessica asked for it. If Mike doesn't show up, but she doesn't say anything. That's on her. If Mike, um, up and it's not working well, whatever, then then that's just a talk about it, but if they showed up, then then it's good. So, and if Jessica didn't show up and Mike did, then he could say something, know what I mean? So there's no, there's really no reason to be more involved in it other than to say, okay, I hear you. Here's the plan. We're going to make it happen. Let me start the conversation between the two of you so that. that you know, as your reader, that I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, this needs to happen, make it happen, that kind of thing, but from here, your job is to make it happen, not, not mind. I'm not going to call you, did you talk to her, did you do this, did you have your meeting, this is the job, you said that you need this to do your job well, make it happen. If you have issues, report the issues. Otherwise, I assume it's getting done.
00:56:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what else did she say?
00:56:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So then we moved to the third section, which I call coaching, any things that I have noticed that you can use a little bit of coaching on. And last month, one of the things I noticed is that well, number one, there's a lot of time spent on non bodily injury issues, like property damage, or just like, you know, listening to your client complain. about her life and things like that so she's you know maybe spending a little bit too too much time on empathy and there's a balance right because you don't want to get subbed out every month because you're too uh too short but at the same time you know I noticed that she was missing a lot of calls because the call that she had taken 45 minutes ago was still happening uh and so kind of thing yeah same thing as John you know uh you know we talking about last time so we talked a little bit about some uh being able to set down Teresa's client even if she has to say hey I'm so sorry I have to go into a meeting right now uh you know I can check in with you in a week to see if we can um if we can get this this thing resolved and then uh the other thing is case value we discussed case value and how we can better communicate with providers to make sure that even if the client doesn't want to do pain management, well maybe we can do a consultation and get an estimate, at least I guess it's more valuable on the case than just the chiropractor and MRI. If we have an estimate for a pain management dog, then there's future that needs to be considered. Even though state farm will likely not consider them, at least they have to, at least that gives us more of an argument. And then we set a date for the next meeting and that's it. That was my first monthly meeting, my first structured monthly meeting with them, so I kept it pretty simple, but if you have any suggestion of things that we can add to that.
00:58:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it starts small, be consistent, measure the results of the start, and then you make improvements based off of what you've observed. It's entirely too, you can't think of the word, but so that is not the right word, but it's to want to go big and try to over plan and strategize and make the perfect thing, but the simplest solution is often the best solution. So trying to over plan and strategize how that should go, it is not good. Generally, it's going to stay very simple, very small, and the fine tuning comes from the content on the call with the person. What issues get revealed, what things tend to show up fairly consistently for a single person or across the board, and now what they because now we've got a pattern established, good or bad, so whatever the strengths are, you want to turn that up, right? And whatever the issues are, you want to turn that down. So it's more about creating a system for revelation of what do I not know, but what do my assets, my team know, and that's it. having our conversations, reviewing you go for calls with them and just kind of riffing off of what you learned, combine your experience with my experience, know, none of us are perfect at any of this, but, you know, two has better than one kind of thing, as long as it's a good head. mean, some people are just kind of, yeah, think Mark does a good job hiring people. for next. And it's interesting, too, because there's a variety of personalities and skills and ability, and that's one of my favorite things about it, though, is seeing the shifting across teams and how people show up differently on different teams.
01:01:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know. I think that's why I learned a lot from you last year, is to kind of play to each team members' strength and not try to force them to a square pet into just a round hole.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and not playing to their weaknesses per se, but figuring out what you can do sometimes to mitigate the weakness or, I mean, sometimes it's training, but sometimes the issue is personality and brain function, like some people's brains just don't work analytically or in the same kind of systematic way, and some cannot. deal with chaos like Cynthia, like it has to be structured or she's overwhelmed. And that's not a fault. She literally cannot choose to be a different way. So trying to compel her to be a different way, not only is it can't it's not going to be successful, but eventually that would just that could break a person. That's real depression. That's real anxiety.
01:02:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's real health. That's I couldn't see that. When she was on my team, I kind of could see that a little bit. She was just, you know, really getting frustrated with our style and our kind of, you know, like get it done as quickly as possible whenever you can and fit it in between function, like.
01:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the way people procedurally do things, those things are innate and they can't be trained. You can corral a little bit, but a small percentage, whereas if you can determine what their strengths are and amplify their strengths, it's pretty easy to amplify strengths when you realize what they are with somebody and give them the resources to do that and that also will increase autonomy. Then you now have an expert who can train some things to other people. There's a whole another way about being able to take advantage of that and not everybody can. There's also a threshold for emotional pain and stress that people can handle. Like Samantha, there's no comparison, I would imagine that Cynthia and Samantha probably could not get along well at all. That could break Samantha or Cynthia. I don't know, I'm guessing, but based off of what I know about certain personality types and performances, that looks like a disaster. Samantha is not wrong for being Samantha and the way that she runs. She's not bad for it. It's just how she, then there are people who can work really, really well in that environment. But Cynthia is not wrong for how she is. She's just Cynthia. So, but we've got people who are willing to show up every day, who are willing to tell the truth and be honest, be an integrity, who care about their jobs. Those things you can't train either. They are either there or they're not. And as large as this world is, there is a shortage of those type of people who will just rather than feel entitled to a paycheck simply because they were given a job. that is a really small percentage of people and that's decreasing. So when we've got people who are willing to work, who are teachable, at least willing to be taught, there's always the mental capacity of how much somebody can be taught. Interestingly, the only person, I've only ever fired two people in my life out of hundreds for being completely unteachable on a mental, intellectual level. One of them's name was Cynthia. She was so sweet and I hated firing her, but I had to fire her because there was nothing I could do to get through to her within the capacity that I was allowed to within the corporation. But that is almost always not ever the thing. What I usually end up having to terminate somebody for is bad attitude, unwillingness to follow procedures, unwind. willingness, not inability, but unwillingness to follow procedures, the way that they treat the customers, not showing up on time, not being reliable. It was almost never a training issue, because if I could figure out what their strengths were, I could figure out how to use them well. And some everybody's got strengths. But if they don't have the foundations of showing up being an integrity, being truthful, being dependable, playing as nicely as they can with others, at least being respectful. Samantha, I think, is super aggressive, but I don't think she's disrespectful. So some people just can't handle aggressive. I'm aggressive. I've learned to tone it down, because I don't want to narrow my pool of people that I can work with. And I've been offensive unintentionally, many, many, many times, sometimes intentionally. Yes, it's the Portuguese in me, but, um, but there's also African and Filipino and all kinds of other angry people. So, wait, I'm not saying that I agree with you. Uh, yeah. Anyway, so, okay, so having these consistent meetings, having a consistent, um, what you call it? Agenda and feedback. Let me go back to your notes. I like, um, hopefully you like that we went through and got the averages so now that you can. Yeah, I think averages is much better because it allows you to compete with yourself. Um, on a more realistic level. So there's two things that you can do. First of all, month to month, did you beat your average and also are you increasing your average because that's really what you want to see. Month to month is difficult because there's just a lot of play in the cases that you get. Yeah. And I like that you're keeping an eye on everybody else. And when you look at the averages, That's the great thing about averages is they it doesn't matter how long somebody has been there. It does because they're not given full case loads. And so you're still not doing apples and until they get full loads, right? But you're able to watch their trajectory and see how they're doing. And if you see somebody new pulling out ahead of you, maybe go like, all right, what are you doing that I'm not doing? What can I learn from you? And tapping into that knowledge base. But also you should be looking for what are you doing good? What's good about you? What are you improving on? Like really, you have to run your own race. Lorenz, because you're too, we are all too unique. We want to be inspired by our teammates, but it shouldn't be about self-deprecating.
01:08:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, you know, and I struggle with that because, you know, of my thoughts and school graduated, you know, with Honors in college and, you know, got, you know, always was like at the very top. And I've been sitting in second place to Sam for a year right now. You that's bugging me.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can look at some things and we can try to break it down what you think it is, but a lot of it is probably going to be how she talks and how she communicates. And so you have to ask yourself what you value most. Do you value most being the top performer in the firm financially? Or do you value being an excellent performer in the firm and being a nice guy that makes people feel good? I'm not saying she doesn't because I don't know that makes your team feel safe. all of these values matter. So you need to decide what your most important values are and you need to rank them. When you evaluate yourself, you need to ask yourself, how did I show up on this value? How did I show up on this one? How did I show up on this one? And then month over month, did I improve on this value? Or did I at least hold steady? And then do that with all the things that matter most to you as a financial success in the company, but also in the way that you show up to your team as a leader, the way that you show up to clients. You need to measure all of the things because you're at the end of the day. First of all, we all have, we slow down, we get older, we slow down a little bit, cognitive function. There's a whole lot of things that go into play there. Having kids is a lot. It's a very difficult job. It is the best job in the world, but you can't always check that stuff at the door. Sometimes you can lose sleep over it. Sometimes what your kids are going through is popping up in your head. You're also married so whatever is going on with your wife You know and the older we get the more health issues come up and even though they're minor But all of these things like there's an accumulation That happens the older we get we care about more people We are involved with more people they take up mental space All of these things have to get taken into account and almost nobody does they're not Does not know that No, nobody does really I I'm just wondering because it seems sometimes like You know, I I want to have those values those non quantifiable values these talk about sometimes it feels like The only values that really matter at the end are the quantifiable the The You need to go have a great conversation then Lorenz and you need to say, I want to know these things. I want to know what matters. First of all, do I need to worry about losing my job and at what point would I need to worry about losing my job? And then you need to ask them what do you value and can you rank what those values are for me so that I understand it and how do you feel I show up in those values and ask them. I would like to know about the financial one. I know what those values are but I want to know are you happy with me? Are you happy with my pace? Like I know you think I can do better because I hear that all the time but what I want to know is what do you value about me and do you feel that my value is enough that if I keep going the way that I am and I'm trying to do the best I can do I need to worry about my job. If that's a concern that you have which seems that you do. Enough comes up. that I come from there's some like professional trauma that comes into it to where I know I've worked in places that you know if you have kids you're always kind of on the shopping block at then you're you're on the and no one says it but I can promise you that that's not what you have with Mark okay I promise you that I would not make a statement I wasn't confident in and it's the opposite he is very tender hearted towards families and kids and has a huge responsibility in taking care of his people as much as possible sweet lot is about the people to him I understand yeah I think that's why I'm very cautious in you know doubting him because honestly he
01:14:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
has given me no reason to to doubt him if I'm very if I'm being objective. And all of myself down actually come from my past experiences at other firms.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good to know. But you know what it markers the kind of person I think you can have that conversation with and you can blame it on me. I'm just like I'm just talking to Tina and these things are coming out and I'm realizing I've got these fears and I think they're holding me back and like like you can tell them you want to do the best that you can you can tell them what you think your weaknesses are and what you're working on you can tell them that you think your teammates some call control training which I just googled and I think that we could probably find some training even if it's through video courses. My first life was in the corporate world and a call center and tech support and when you get old people who don't know how to use a computer now this was 28 years ago so computers back then nobody plenty of friends. Everybody would be like, they thought that CD holder was a coffee cup holder. I'm not kidding you. They would say their computer doesn't work. It's not even plugged in. I'm not kidding you. That was a regular thing. So, and they were lonely and they're like, there's somebody I can talk to. No, you can't because I've got, I've got metrics I have to meet or we don't get paid. So, but if I treat you badly, then I get docked and then we lose our business because they're also measuring that. So, I had to figure out where the safe place was where I could get them out the door, they're happy about it even though they didn't get the socializing they wanted and they didn't like being told what to do, especially by a little girl, especially the men. Didn't all like that at all. It was just, you know, almost 30 years ago. So, a lot has changed since then, but that was a whole different world. Anyway, your team call control for sure could learn that. I think everybody at Sweet Law intake, especially, needs call control skills. I've been talking about this with Mark. I really just need to go find the solution for him and get people on there and training, because I think that I haven't even listened to the calls. But from what I've heard, it's got to be there's way too much allowed to happen. And there is a way to finesse a conversation so that it's handled efficiently without hurting feelings. And it still feels like care. that is a skill, and it is trainable. Everybody won't learn it as well. Anyway, so, Pondre, think about it. But if you're not sure who you're working for, I would recommend that you figure that out.
01:16:50 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I'm getting an idea. Honestly, I share those, I share this with you kind of in confidence, but also because that's You know, that's some of the feedback I'm getting from the CMs that have been here a little longer kind of, you know, they kind of get the same feeling like that, you know, they like Mark and they feel like, you know, the firms are whole values then but they It's so inscrutable sometimes, it's hard to say, it's hard to see if he thinks he's doing good job or not. And you know, I think, you know, I will have that conversation with them probably later this month.
01:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll give you one more perspective. He pays me $1,000 an hour to have these conversations with you and I have no oversight whatsoever.
01:17:42 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, wow. Do you know anybody else that would be up for you? What's that? We should probably end this call soon we're over.
01:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I, it's not hourly. It's monthly. This is, this is my time. So it's me.
01:17:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Honestly, that that did. a lot of my confidence when we set up these calls because I know how much he values you and so if I was I know that if I was on the shopping block he wouldn't bother.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No 100% would not because there are other people that not really on the shopping block but he would not invest in. So that's also between us. Um but do you know anybody else have you ever worked with anybody else that would give you that kind of training and that kind of time?
01:18:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No.
01:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I understand that it's what you hear is get this stuff done. But um I don't know if you were listening.
01:18:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
By the way sorry for interrupting but I don't kind of the same one of the issues that I'm kind of the same as Mark is I also think about what's next. I never take the time to smell the roses.
01:19:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you really care about your people, don't you? Yeah. And you're not looking for ways to fire than you're looking for, how do I help them, right?
01:19:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Exactly, yeah.
01:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I think that you two are, you have some similarities. There's a scripture though that says, shall know them by their fruits. How many people do you see getting fired at Sweet Law?
01:19:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I've seen in two years, I've seen one. And I've seen people leave, but getting straight up fired in one thing, because she never showed up, essentially.
01:19:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably pretty unique, isn't it? Yeah. How many people do you see getting suspended, terminated, like, fully berated in front of everybody? I've never seen her. And how many times have you heard somebody like complain is just about getting. two down getting threatened with our job and just high levels of stress over it. Let me just give you one more example. Cynthia is still there. I know Mark has a hard time with her too, but he still keeps her and she's easier to replace than than an attorney. So I don't tell you a lot right now. When I say you shall know them by their fruits, you can say all that you want to do and you can look like a prickly pear, but if you're soft on the inside, you know, that's what kind of fruit that we have is that at the end of the day, the people are really what matter most. The business has to be profitable for the sake of the people. What good is it to you? Sweet Law isn't profitable. You don't have a job anymore. So he has to push that. But but also tell you one more thing and then I do need to wrap up is that when we start reported this. It was supposed to be every other week. And it was mostly about marketing business building. And it was with, it was my client that Mark also works with. They were working together and he says, I need Tina in here because she does something I don't want to do, I don't do, but I need you to have her helping you. And so we got on a call and then the second week, Mark said, how do I get this weekly and how do I focus on leadership? I've never had anybody before that say, I need to work on my leadership. Now we did that, but nobody just asked and they didn't ask right out of the gate because I had asked him some questions and he and his self reflection was like, I need to be a better leader. And so he's been working on it. So I will tell you, you have a very unique person that you're working with. And if you do better because you just want to do better and make them happy but not because they're scared. That energy is different. How we operate from fear is very different than how we operate from confidence, even if we have the same exact goal. So ponder that a little bit and maybe get to know what we work for.
01:22:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's funny because I just said that's my 11 year old last night. It was just that conversation.
01:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And this is why we all need people that we can talk to you because we know the things but sometimes we feel to recognize where we're not employing.
01:22:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's me.
01:22:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's me. It's all of us, really. It's all of us. We have to have those people. So but when you're at the top in your area and there's really not a lot of oversight from Mark. So really you're top dog and there's not a lot of people to counsel with but also you know don't necessarily want to tell your boss everything that you're worried about, especially with previous trauma. In the standard corporate world, that's just not that's just not good for business. It's not a safe thing to do. But what I'm expressing to you is that you do have a very different situation. situation here, and I would suggest that you explore it, and then ask for advice, use mark, but I think if we keep having these conversations, just inspecting how you're doing things and making these little changes, the amazing compounding effect over time you look back and you go, wow, we're all different. And it's just because we're inspecting it honestly and bull normally every week and then making some decisions based off of that and it's pretty powerful.
01:23:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I appreciate you showing up and, you know, not being like, oh, Lorenz, you know, you're just too nice of a guy or he's not getting it or, you know, I appreciate you. I know I take some repetition, you know, I know I can be a little stubborn in my ways because I'm probably a lot better than you think you are.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I promise you, it does mean no good to tell people things like that and to lie. I get nothing. out of it except for more work. If I were to compliment you falsely, I'd just mean my job harder. You're better than you think you are. Whatever that past trauma is, whether it's in the workplace or anywhere else, I know. But generally the best people are the ones that are the hardest on themselves and it's usually the jerks that think that they're the most amazing people in the world. It's so weird, but that's the truth. So the reason you can see your flaws so much is because you're looking for them and because you're trying to improve them, whereas an egomaniac and an narcissist is not looking for their flaws, they're looking for how awesome they are and they're working on nothing. So take that into account too. There's a balance for everything, but what I want you to make sure that you're doing every day is, what did I do good today? What was good? What did I move forward or what did I do even though it was hard? What did I do to Help somebody else be better. What did I hold myself back from when I just really want to You know take into account all the things that you did good if it was it was You know spouse related if it was parenting related if it was health related because we can't do all things all the time So you have to take all the things into account Because what you might do is go. Yeah, I dropped a ball at work hard for today But if you had a super dad day, I don't really care what you did at work that day I really don't because it all comes out in the wash But Lorenz is the one at the center of it. You're the nucleus of that world and so you have to count all the winds and You can't just go. I did all these things wrong. I'm not saying don't take stock of the things that should have been better I'm just saying count all the good things every day You'll start to feel better about yourself and not in an egotistical way You'll just recognize your power and you'll be able to let your weakness says have less power over you recognize that they're just human and tomorrow will be a little bit less weak and a little bit more strong.
01:26:08 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
No, I think that's good advice. think that's what I've been working on this year is trying to be lose my confidence less easily when something bad happens when trying to.
01:26:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this is, I know you're saying it's the last thing, but this is where your tracking is going to help you. Okay, so looking at all of your stats and having them in a spreadsheet where you can look at your monthly's, but then your average is, and you're just looking for incremental improvements. So when you go have a bad month, you go back and look at your average and go, but it only knocks my average down a little bit. So maybe the disparity between the two months are super huge. The average is going to come out and so you're going to go, you know what, bad month, shake it off, month we're on fire because we're due for it.
01:26:55 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That's how it's going to work. I see. Now that's good. I'm glad you. but the formula's in there. going keep them going for the, you know, every month now.
01:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and that we want to track attorney fees too. So I'm going to see if there's an easy way to do that through the reporting and if not, we're going to create a spreadsheet and take Michelle's stuff and just start tracking that and whatever reports Mark gives you and we'll make our own spreadsheet and tracker because that is actually going to help you too because you'll keep it in a track of that anyways and that's good. All right, well you have a great amazing week and I will talk to you

00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.

That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

## Quote 23

> 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll keep following up with you then. And everybody go, have a good day and talk to you next week.
01:06:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, bye-bye. Bye.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, wait, wait. What?
01:06:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I sent the turn, the new turn down reasons to you and Patsy and then she never responded because she left him returning leave. He left. just put those in place.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

> 00:00:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Hey, yeah, I can hear you.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How was vacation?
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
It was good. Just got home really late last night. But other than that, it was fun.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a good time. Yeah. Was it like a family thing or you just like hanging out?
00:00:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Nice. Nice.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel? Well, you probably feel too tired to be refreshed, but. Yeah. Do you feel refreshed at all?
00:00:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Because my friends like, we like to really chill out. So we weren't doing too many activities.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:00:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We had a lot of time to relax and stuff. So I didn't think I needed a vacation. But after I came back, was like, yeah, needed that.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's funny sometimes how you don't know what you need until you get it.
00:00:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And then you're like, oh, It's like sometimes getting a massage and like the masseuse gets in there. like, I did not know that. I heard that bad and then exactly you did that and I was like, oh, I think I needed that.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good though. I'm glad that you got it and I'm glad you got that perspective and hopefully you'll remember both that it was useful but also that you weren't aware of how much you needed it. So in the future just kind of think about your time and your energy and maybe there are other things that are day to day like you can't have a vacation all the time but like maybe there are other kinds of things that you could do with your time and your energy that would be helpful that you didn't really know would be like that impactful.
00:01:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You know what I mean?
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you've been gone a while so I have no idea if you've thought about any of the conversations we've been talking about like it's been a while a couple weeks since we've chatted. Any, any thoughts where you were gone or just preparing for the call today?
00:02:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, probably, but I don't really remember the last meeting.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
know most of it was with Lorenz and, you know, how he structures his team and everything like that. But I mean, some good news is, you know, I was gone for a week and I would still check my computer and stuff, but I'm proud of the team because it's all the work that they were doing and, you know, how they were handling everything and, you know, obviously I wasn't there working full time, but it looks like they were able to hold things down, which makes me comfortable knowing that they were working and able to kind of handle the caselope without me being there. Um, so that was good to see that's that's awesome.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Actually, so let me go because I was looking at the numbers for one. Um, which one is. Okay, July so for. So what I was finding interesting. And this month is definitely going to be skewed a little bit because you're out. Hold on a second. I'm still reviewing it. Um, so first of all, let's just kind of recap. Well, I'm taking it. I lost my notes. I don't have too many windows, but I need a few of them to be able to do this. So some of the things that we had talked about was just. Um, the leadership that you were already working on and employing in your team, things like noticing that. at Patsy needed a little bit more clarity and direction and like do this and you don't need to be asked to do it just you know here's your job here's what we expect and and get that done which probably went into you know how things went when you were gone and then I never really I don't know but I haven't memorized who you have I feel like it's Elsie I'm Cynthia Elsie and Cynthia yeah wait did I say Patsy what did I say yeah Patsy sorry I meant Cynthia oh my gosh I don't know what there's some names it just makes up in my head but I did know the difference sorry um although I don't have bases for either one of them so that that kind of happens but Patsy's are in Take Lady and Cynthia is yours and she's been bounced around a few people I remember um anyway so just kind of thinking about That those leadership roles, thinking about the kind of person that you are for your team, that you can be a safe space, which means that you actually have the ability to ask of your team things that other people couldn't. And I don't mean, you know, exceeding boundaries or anything, but meaning that they wouldn't get the same kind of results that you would because you're a safe person, because you'll ask and rather than make somebody feel afraid to mess up or do something wrong or get in trouble, they'll be like, oh, yeah, I totally could do that. And they feel empowered to be able to try to do their best job, because when people are afraid of making mistakes, they don't actually do their best at all. They just do just enough to get bias so that they don't cause problems, which is actually counterproductive, because they end up not, you know, giving their all, but it makes them feel a little bit safer to stay safe. smaller if that makes sense.
00:06:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:06:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But because you have an energy that is not that is like you are intentionally looking out for how they feel and not wanting to overwhelm or intimidate or scare them off or make them feel bad, you can ask for say, you know, let's just just for example what you did with Cynthia say these are the things that I need you to do and then have compliance and have a work on it. So one of the things to try to look for is what are the other things that might be able to improve a little bit in terms of have follow up maybe with cases and making making calls in a timely manner, making sure that the cases that have the greatest potential for higher attorney fees are handled, or if one is at risk for whatever reason of sub-out or drop-out, well, not sub-out, but yeah, sub-out, not drop-out. That's being prioritized so that we don't lose the case, things like that. So that's one thing. I'm thinking I forgot what I was going to ask you. I should have wrote that down. Oh, oh proud. Okay, so we're looking at stats. me just provide some real quick. And I'm going to share my screen and don't think I'm sharing anything I'm not supposed to, and then I'll just get yelled at if I am just kidding because Mark doesn't yell, but not me anyway. Does Mark yell?
00:07:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Never.
00:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds not right. I mean, I can see him having it, especially the conversations we had in the beginning. I think he told me about having a temper and I think I yelled at him a few times and said stop it. So, but I don't know how he is now. Anyway, okay, so I'm looking at cases this year and obviously I know that the thing to keep in mind is that you, your cases are throttled. You get a lot of Mark's cases. they're not just your own and everything hasn't been opened up to you like it has to the other attorneys. So, this is not apples to apples by any means. But I still think that it's impressive in the resolutions. So, in June, Tyler had 19, Samantha had 21, and you had 21. And to me, and I could be wrong about this, but that's kind of a good indicator. So, there was this, but it's not enough data, right? So, Look how small this one. There's only three for the month so far compared to 13 and seven and I almost don't even want to compare Tyler. I'd rather compare just Samantha. And then Lauren's isn't even on the board for this month. So You know what resolutions mean, like, is that Is it isn't that when you are paid out? Which one is the one that's your paid out? Which one is the one that it's done done?
00:09:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Done done is money and attorney's fees.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but there's And then there's cases settled. Yes, and that's which one I'm trying to figure out cases closed or resolution.
00:09:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That's one of these two. Okay, because whichever Okay, yeah, cases closed would mean money and And then resolution is like any sort of settlement.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that that's what I was looking at. And that's the thing, this is what you guys have the most control over, not when you get paid, right?
00:10:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
How much do I have for resolutions?
00:10:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For this month?
00:10:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's not accurate.
00:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the other thing, this is a new report. So I don't know if you remember, I was looking at it and saying I didn't know if I want to show it yet.
00:10:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, my list is 10, so.
00:10:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what about last month?
00:10:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So I can compare. Last month was 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2, 14, 15, 16, 18. 18? And those were all my cases, were any mark crossovers.
00:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then let's compare cases closed, so paid, is I want to see what these numbers are and then all.
00:10:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So last month I had 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, Okay. And the month before. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Okay. Oh, what did I click on? I'm gonna do that. Okay, so then I need to send a note off just a second. Mark.
00:12:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You Okay.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, I sent that off. Hopefully we can get that figured out. Oh, let's see. Policy limit. Okay, I'm not going to look at this anymore right now, whoops, because I want to make sure that it's accurate. So we'll dig into that. That report's only actually few days old, a few days, a few weeks old, and it usually takes us a few iterations, actually, let me go, let's see, reports, oh, that's why report reports. Let's see matters closed, we'll just type in matters, matters by team, or by principal attorney active matters, and I want that, I want that much by team. Let's see if I can edit this. No filter. I. Attorney. No, not as fun to be. Owner. So would the attorney be the owner?
00:14:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Probably. Yeah, that would be accurate. Sometimes it'll change and the owner will be the old attorney, but I don't have too many of those.
00:14:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we'll just say. See if that will. Well. Save and run. And then. right. right. right. All right.
00:15:21 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
That means we take our fee and hold like a certain amount in a trust account until I'll hold in trust.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's see but there's 141. So does that sound right? 141 records that you think that you've gone through? Let's see if I can create a status. I do want already. All right. So part of this process, though, is learning how to get better reports so that we can have, first of all, accurate data and then, well, accurate data that matters and really review it so that you can know exactly where you stand and also how you're ranking within the team. So since I don't have something reliable, how about you tell me what your team did while you were gone is as much detail as possible because that will also help me with the reporting stuff and then also help us with next questions and what we're going to work on.
00:16:46 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You said how they did when were gone. would have to be choked.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let's just do this. Let's kind of take inventory of last week. So we'll look at how many new cases were there. How many got settled. Just any, any issues, any calls, if there was any disbursements that happened. Yeah.
00:17:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Okay, let me see. We got one, two, four, five new cases last week. We did two settlements last week. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then for fees, we got two as well.
00:18:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what percentage of. So you're going, your max is 40% right for attorney fees. Yeah. What, what, what were each of those two cases?
00:18:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
40%.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. One of them was a big, big case or fee was 68,000.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And who handled that conversation?
00:18:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I did that one. Oh, you did that.
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, good job. Okay. So you handled the conversation about distributions, not disbursements.
00:18:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Actually, for all my cases, I do once it gets to like closing it out, getting the district. patient sign, I do all that.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, for all the cases, so what I'm trying to dig into is when you came back and you said your team did really well, how do you measure that? How do you quantify that? Like, what did you look at and go? That's they did that well.
00:19:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I noticed I got multiple emails on certain cases where we were waiting one medical bill in order for me to send a demand and they would let me know that it came in and that it's ready to be demanded. The new cases that come in, I know that's all mostly LC, reaching out to the clients, setting them up with treatment. That was getting done. I can see that certain things that were coming in, Cynthia was saving them in the case files, know, notating how much the chiropractor. it was, we use this internal thing on Lidify, it's called Chatter. That's where they kind of let me know, you know, this on updates on cases. We had one case, it was like a weird sub out, it's one of Mark's cases, I guess the guy had another firm for like a while, and then he signed on with us. But I wasn't there to, you know, handle that, and Cynthia was able to send all the documents, the case file, so that got handled. And I would see the notifications on slide, like a call would come in, and you know, I'll see what, you know, take it. So I keep eye on those things, which lets me know that, you know, if they're not really on top of things that they'll either be slow to respond, or they won't take the call. Um, so that lets me know that, you know, they were on top of everything. Um, was sending me requests for authorized treatment for certain clients, um, is important because we need to make sure that, you know, the policy limits are adequate enough to authorize certain treatment, for example, Um, so she was asking me, you know, she was sending me emails and saying, can you please, you know, authorize X for this client?
00:21:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, and you, you know, you were on vacation. You responded to all of that?
00:21:39 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah. Yeah. had my computer out there. So, um, when I had time, I would go through and see what, you know, what was urgent and respond to those.
00:21:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think your average response time was during that time.
00:21:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I was pretty slow because we're three hours behind over there. So. I was working like. I was. eight PM our time.
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you were so they never waited longer than a day. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, you're you're so that kind of speaks to the leadership skills too. And now I know that it comes with the territory that stuff still has to get handled and has to be done timely.
00:22:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
But that doesn't mean everybody does their job. You know that, right? Yeah, I know.
00:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that that probably had a huge impact on the fact that your team was staying on top of it was that you were also staying on top of it, even when on vacation. So that's really important. And you gave them a very clear signal that work matters and that we will we will get things done. And so even while not being physically present, although are you guys all remote? Who's in the office?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Um, they're both in the office every now and then I'll see what we'll come home. Um, that's for the most part. She's she's in the office.
00:22:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that's great. Now, if you were to go and look for things that maybe weren't handled well, first of all, did it occur to you to do that? Did you think about doing that? Did you do that? Look to see if anything slipped while you were on it.
00:23:20 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, because what happens is on like, at some point we'll get like our clients policy limits or the other, you know, full parties policy limits. And I noticed like on two cases, like, because we get a lot of documents from this and team, it's like a lot. And I already told the team, like, I have like a CD, so I'll double check to make sure certain things get notated. And naturally like things, even when I'm there, like, I'll see we'll get to it, but for me, like knowing the policy limits is like one of the key parts of the case, because it's so easy to like authorize an injection. or we don't know what the limits are and it can get really bad, so I just like to know and it's just like a piece of mine for everybody, even Mark, when he's looking through the case to know, it's like our baseline for how the case is going to go. So I just noticed like we would get a declaration page which shows policy limits and then just wasn't notated in the file. So there were a few cases where I went and I did that myself, which I do when I'm in the office anyways. But other than that, nothing where I was like, hey, like keep an eye on this, can't make this mistake again type of thing. I just honestly felt like I was just another week.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that kind of stuff happens anyway, right?
00:24:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Is that what you're saying? it gets done, but like I'm just like when I see those like two letters PL, which means policy limits like I'm just like really quick on it just because I don't want to miss it.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've communicated that I'm sure you have to them that that that's the thing that like that has to be on every single case.
00:25:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how is that received? you feel like? I mean, this is the job and nobody's perfect all the time. Right. There's got to be a margin of error. But what we can do, what we can work on is focus on the big rocks. So what. What are the things that matter the most knowing what the policy limits are definitely right up there.
00:25:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if something else slips, that's maybe less important. And I don't even know what that would be. But, but let's say that there are non-negotiable like these always need to get done. matter what. Don't everyone see this. There's not a threat implied that there are anything. It's just that this is non-negotiable. Make sure this happens on every case. Do not finish or no. until you've checked yourself, are the policy limits notated, that type of thing. Have you had a conversation to that degree? Now, I can sound very kind of like hostile forcehole. So I'm not talking about with my energy, right? I'm talking about with that kind of clarity and emphasis on this has to be done every time.
00:26:26 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, that's one of them. Because even they know like, if we don't know what type of insurance we're dealing with because Elsie sets up the treatment. So once she goes to do that, she'll naturally have a tendency to look and see how much room we have money-wise, you know, for treatment. Now there are times where we know the other party's insurance or our insurance has like a lot of money, then it's not as important to figure out everybody's coverage because if it's like half a million, like, there's... definitely plenty of money, so we don't need to know exactly how much everybody has right now, because the case probably won't go that far. But on cases where she's going to set up treatment a week or two has gone by and we don't have any insurance yet, then it's like they know to make sure we figure out or else if you're authorizing treatment without any insurance because there may not even be any insurance. That's when that gets like expedited, so they'll figure out how much money we have to work with. That's one. Another one is client calls when we get a new case, not to let it like more than one day go by without any client contact. I'm trying to think of other non-negotiables. like if a client's like kind of threatening to sub out like any type of like text or anything like that to call them right away or well sometimes I'll call right away just to kind of calm the client down because if you know say we get that text and no one reached out then it's you know pretty bad mistake so that's another one. Certain things like if we have a $15,000 limit never authorized more than one MRI because we don't have the money to. The teams are pretty good at that. I would say those are like the main like none of those triple things it's just like basic case management setups.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I know that you're not in the place where you get incentive yet. And I know that the team doesn't have an incentive plan, but right now Samantha has her own, Lorenz has his own. I did talk to Mark about trying to standardize that. That's kind of a long process. It's an ongoing conversation about modifying that anyway. But in the meantime, these are the types of things that would be generating incentive pay for you, which would then give you something to reward them with. So do you have any sets, kind of review periods with your team or just like one-on-one conversations and meetings about performance and any issues they might have and what kind of support they need as a structured set type of conversation?
00:29:58 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
We have our weekly meetings. But other than that, like anything one on one haven't really done yet. Cynthia will come in like every now and then and just, you know, to me, make sure that she's doing a good job. And then with Elsie, I haven't had a one on one with her yet. I think she's only been with us almost not even six months yet. But like on the big cases where I know like it was a pain to settle that one or get it done or like a really big one, I make sure like on our settlement channel, you know, to put their names in there too, just to make sure that they feel like they're a part of it because it's so easy for the attorney to take credit on the cases where in reality, like the team is the one who's doing a majority of the grant work that helped. I'll just get the case done. I know Cynthia appreciates that a lot. I'll see's a little bit more.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The appreciates just being given credit for that work? Yeah.
00:31:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Lawrence told me that when she did come to my team. So that's been good. So I keep those things in mind. if I know there was one case, almost half a million settlement, Cynthia helped get these records that the insurance really wanted to see before they would throw out an offer and she got that done really quickly. So when we settled the case, I made sure to put her name in there too, and how she helped contribute to the case. That's like not money stuff incentive, but yeah, I know that if I was on her end, you know, I would appreciate my work being noted, you know, that way, when they come to work, it's not like, well, I'm doing all this work and the attorneys. Taking all the credit for it. They get more pay to me Because at the end of the day like I feel like everybody thinks about those type of things I want my team to know like Just because I have a degree doesn't mean like I'm on a different pedestal Now sometimes I'll request records if I really need it Just to show them that like we're all on the same They level like no one's better than anybody And I feel like those type of things when I'm gone. It's like they do their best job when I'm not there out of respect Because of the way that you know I treat them overall Ask you a question though Do Cynthia doesn't do I have any kind of college degree? I don't know to be honest or elsey I'm not sure either one does the one thing to keep in mind is
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
on a human being level and on a showing up to work level, know, that part is equal, but the investment that you made to get to your job is not.
00:33:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Right.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of school, so that kind of time, and then also the money that goes into school, whether you paid it out of pocket or however it got funded, that's a lot of money. Yeah. that, you'll never get that time back. You invested that to be here, whereas somebody else just applied for our job. So even if they got experience on the job somewhere else, they were still getting paid for that.
00:33:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
You don't get paid to go to school.
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. that is one thing to keep in mind when it comes to it is that you're not all equal in the workforce when it comes to that because you've paid a price that they didn't pay. So, your return is, the other thing is they are not accountable when things go wrong, you have the liability they don't. And part of the compensation is your risk and your liability for the work that's getting done. And that's a real thing. Now the odds that something is going to go so bad that you're going to, that it's going to ever actually cost you is probably pretty low because you're managing things well. But there is real risk involved in practicing law. And they don't have that risk, they don't bear that risk. And they didn't make the investment of all that time and all that money. So it is important and I want you just to kind of stash that away in case it ever comes up. And at least just ponder it like what does that mean and how would that show up when you do get incentive and I think that that is something that you should take into account. This isn't about being better than anyone else or how you show up right now. So for example, you know, when I do my work, I've had people try to figure out how long something takes me and want to pay me an hourly rates. And I work faster than five, sometimes 10 people, depending on who it is. I, but the reason I can do that is because I've acquired a lot of skill in my practice. I've put in hours and hours and hours of work and study and repetitions to make me really good at it. I have top-of-the-line equipment all the time, all the time. I say on top of it all the time. So when somebody's paying me and I don't even do hourly work anymore, but when somebody's paying me, they're getting access to all of that. All of those scales, all that experience, the money that I spent on the technology. And so they're trying to compare me, sometimes they would, this is historical, try to compare me to somebody else or what they think is industry standard. I'm like, son, I'm not industry standard. Look at the results, that's obvious. But it's the same kind of math, right? People want to do and think that they're doing the equation and that this is what it's like in a job. We're all a team and we're all equal, but not all teams are equal. So let's say you've got the captain of the varsity team and he steps down to play with the second string and they're not all equal. The skill level is not equal, the hours probably are not equal. So it's just important. I just want you to make sure that you keep that in mind. there's a way to use that information. and not understanding without, you know, it's not a power trip or lording over. I just want to make sure that you don't undermine yourself or discount what you have brought to the table and also the burden that you bear that is invisible because liability nobody's thinking about it. You might think about it from time to time. They're probably not thinking like if this goes wrong, you know, I might lose job at Patrick could be sued. You know what I mean?
00:37:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:37:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I know it was a long whole monologue thing. I just want to talk about these things as we're kind of going into how you're structuring and leaning. Okay, so client calls now. Okay, so I think that it would be a good idea for you to set up and they can be very short, but monthly one-on-ones with individual member. So with right, your current team is just LC and Cynthia. So with each of them, and it should have a specific agenda of things that need to be covered for sure, all the non-negotiables should be covered, things that you've noticed. Hey, Cynthia, great job. a single one of your people went more than a day without being contacted when you were here, right? Any kind of threats to sub out, you handled it immediately. You never authorized more than one MRI when somebody had a $15,000 any of those things. So first of all, they know how much you're paying attention to what they're doing, and they're getting credit for not just, hey, good job, but very specific, good job, right? Did you play sports?
00:38:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
don't remember if you told me that or not. Yeah, I played a waterfall and I swam in high school.
00:38:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. I remember I remembered it was water. I forgot about the polo, but yeah, so anyway, just really specifics about about what they're doing and what they're doing really well and maybe especially because if let's say they're not doing one thing really well, when you bring that out, no, it does not feel good. likes that and but but it still has to be said. You can soften the blow instead of just by saying, hey, you need to fix this because this isn't happening and this is this is crucial. Soften the blow, but you have been amazing at this and you've been amazing at this and you've been amazing at that and so keep doing this job also and not but right because everybody ignores everything after the blood but also let's work on improving this and then when the incentive time comes around, you have specific things that you can. pay your incentive on. So it can be these types of things. There'll probably be some other things you want to break down. Basically, anything that is a lever or a switch, you know, in the business that makes a significant impact that you can track, that you can measure for sure, all of those things that you just mentioned. There may be a little bit more detail and nuance to it. Maybe it's the reporting. Maybe it's the communication. I don't know, but these are the things that we want to look at. And so then if you have a meeting with them each month and you're letting them know, hey, I've looked at all of this stuff and really you're like, I'm so impressed. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. You did this. that is amazing. I did notice this. I would love to work on this. Is there any way I can support you in doing better here? And then you be quiet and see what they feel like. And generally, especially if you really have people that want to do well and care about how you feel about it. You'll either maybe get the actually I know that I kind of been dropping the ball and I could do better and just okay will you do better and then again you be quiet. Not just hey I know you can do better but very specifically an accountability question will you do better and if they say they're gonna say yes nobody's gonna say no and sometimes they may say try I'll try and then you can rephrase it and say I didn't ask you if you try I asked you well you do better and if they say well you know I'll try it okay so if you can't commit to doing better is there a reason why you can't commit to doing better is it is that is that hard for you do you need some training in that area is it you know what I mean like Is that an opportunity to either maybe shift that task to somebody else or strengthen them, give them training? But if you see something wrong and they can't say, I 100% can do better and I'm going to do better, then you want to figure out and drill down a little bit more. OK, why not? And how can we make that better? But I think that with the goals that you have for just killing it, really, and the team that you have and the way that you're leading, just so back to leverage, right? Just by picking one particular thing to work on, which would be reviews over a very specific set of topics, which I would love to see. So do you feel like you have enough time to set this up by next Monday when we all meet together?
00:42:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
A set of incentive things that I would like to see?
00:42:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It could be incentive. But basically, it's like, what it... What are the criteria that you want to review with each of your team monthly that eventually will be how you can, and you can modify this so this can be rough draft. But what I would like is, yeah, that structure, these are the things that matter most, so I'm going to review it with my team. But also when incentive time comes around, it would make sense that the things that matter most impact incentive. So you don't have to figure out how you would structure it and how you would weigh it and what you would pay. But what are the topics that you would review with each person, and this should be like five to ten elements that you have. And you can rank them right. Here's our five critical and five non-negotiables, and here's our five, know, this is not as important, but this definitely impacts the quality of results type of thing. You think you could have a rough draft that by Monday? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. rough draft. I love the new part to that. Awesome. Awesome. I was thinking about then, you know, let the team know that starting next month and maybe, and maybe it'll be the end of the month so maybe like end of August so you've got time to put this together. And, but then I was thinking maybe we don't want to tell them and tell that you've put something together for sure to let them know what you're going to be measuring, rather than it being like a sucker punch. Hey, I'm looking at this, which it should not be right because they should be very aware of what their duties are. There's a magical thing that happens when people know that they're being scrutinized a little bit more as they perform well, especially if they feel like it's not a negative thing, like someone's paying attention, but they're not, you know, looking for ways to screw up. And you can tell them when they're doing it, like, Hey, I'm going to be looking at these things. And I know that Elsie, you're awesome at this stuff and Cynthia, you're awesome at this stuff. And but I really want to know how to celebrate your wins and really look at where you're shining. But also look for opportunities for improvement and see if there's any kind of training maybe that we can have, because that's the whole point of it, right? We're not trying to ensnare anyone and catch them in a trap. We are trying to help everybody be better and also make sure that we're looking at what we can appreciate in what they're doing. Make sense?
00:45:56 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What do you think about that? how do you feel? I mean, I basically just kind of said, you should do this.
00:46:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
And I want to know what your thoughts are on it. I think it would be good. I know for Cynthia, it would be good for her to hear that she's doing good because like sometimes we'll just like talk about a case like in my office or whatever. And then before she leaves, she's always like, am I doing good? Like, just want to make sure I'm doing good. So I know she likes to feed back. And then with LC, I mean, we can test it out and see how she likes it. I think it would be good like review every month because like, let's say we set the standard today. Everybody, you know, all the boxes and then like month two, two and a half, things start to like naturally fall off again, which is normal. So it'd be like a good thing that they know like every month. I'm gonna, you know, ask about You know, X, Y, Z Whereas right now it's kind of like we already talked about it and it's up to them how long they want to continue to Work on those things So I might be good to have like a Set date every time, you know once a month that I'm gonna ask them about You know those five to ten key things I'm definitely opening to trying it because They'll also give me an opportunity to know that, you know, we go over this every month.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's no reason for it to Not get done So I do think it's a good idea So couple of things I thought about why you're talking And I know that you're still kind I'm now Elsie's only six months around, Cynthia has been moved around, so really to get a good kind of gauge of things, I would like you to commit to it for a minimum of six months, are you willing to do that?
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and then the other thing is what I would like you to do, especially so that they feel that this is opening the lines of communication and kind of reinforcing that the fact that this is a safe space is, is there anything, when you, at the end of it, ask them, okay, is there anything that I can do better for you? Do you feel like there's a system or process that needs some improvement? Do you have recommendations about how we can better operate? So it starts with the wins, what they're doing good, a little bit of a coaching session on anything that can be improved, and then we shift the focus off of them, and what can you what can I improve? And then we take it back to the processes. now we're ending on it. It's not a personal note, and then you can just end completely on. Again, you've done an amazing job at these things. Good job, looking forward, you know, to the next one, keep up the good work, that kind of thing so that you can kind of purposely direct the energy almost like conduct, like a music conductor. Right? You purposely starting in a specific spot and ending on a specific note so that it has the the best positive income and doesn't have like any kind of negative impact on the day. Even if there's a coaching session, you kind of take the heat off with making, putting some attention on you and just the business in general. Yeah. Okay. So you have your weekly standup meetings. What is the format of those or what you didn't call them standup, but you We can team meetings. What is the format of that?
00:50:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Typically, if I have something that I want to like an urgent thing, I'll usually bring that up first. But most of the time, we kind of just, you know, they have any concerns about certain cases or like a question, I'll just ask them like on any specific cases you guys want to go over. Um, you know, anything that, because if it's like really urgent, obviously we talk about it like right then and there, like else you just message me or come into my office. So the meetings are more things like that come up, but they're not like super urgent. For example, I'm trying to think of an example. Like there was one, there were like denying liabilities, like a word for word to spew. So LC asked me, know, how should we, you know, approach this case? And they know, I tell her, you know, how I would do it. And then for Cynthia, typically, you know, Oscar, are there doctors that are giving you issues on, you know, record requests, are they taken too long? That way I can, you know, reach out personally and try to get it done faster. Sometimes we'll change like how we do things in those meetings. For example, like, I don't know if you know what the health insurance liens are, but Cynthia typically handled those and a few meetings ago. So typically what they'll do is they'll send a form for us to fill out. But I realized when I would do it, I would just call a number. and give them the info that they wanted over the phone and it was much quicker so like in the meeting I was you know advice and they're like hey I tried this because it served responsibly to get those in I was like you know let's try just every time we get one of those requests just call them and give them the info instead of you know filling out the paper faxing him back so in the meetings like if you want to change something how we do things you know we'll go over that in the meetings and then just like general questions like you know are you guys overwhelmed like I always ask Elsie because I know she takes like 90 percent of the phone calls I'll ask her like are you overwhelmed like are you able to are you handling everything do you need me to you know take a few calls this week to you if we get a lot of cases obviously she's gonna make a lot of calls so I Ask her if she needs any help. Typically she's she's able to handle everything. But yeah, let's typically have the meetings go.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are they scheduled regularly?
00:53:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
No, there's no set date to just kind of just I'll just let them know like are you all available for meeting like at 3pm on a certain day or something. But I don't have like a set date yet.
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you for sure have them every week?
00:53:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I mean, we've missed a few weeks like sporadically. But I always talk to them like in the office like they'll talk to us in our office. Cynthia too. But I should probably have like a set date every week to do them.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you learn this in the military, right? there is real power in structure because no way. to expect, you can anticipate it, which means you can be better prepared for it, right?
00:54:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And generally, when we're better prepared for something, the outcome is better. So my recommendation would be to go ahead and schedule that as ideal of the time as you can, where it is a set time every week, and then, you know, if somebody gets hung up on a call or whatever, then you modify it if need be, but do everything you can not to modify it. And at worst case scenario, you know, everybody stands by if they can for a little bit, or more importantly, what should happen because the only only way that that's not controllable is if there's an inbound call that took a really long time, but even still call control skills can kind of probably help with that. So, like, one of their things would be don't make a call, you know, 30 minutes or so, or don't take a call, 15 minutes or so. before the meeting so that nobody gets stuck on a call, make sure that we can show up and be prepared. then the meeting can have a similar structure to the reviews, not necessarily the same stuff, but a very specific structure. One thing I would recommend is start with the winds. It always kind of helps the mood and the energy, especially if everybody knows that's where we're starting. We're not going to dive right into stress. We're going to say, hey, because I know you're watching your team anyway, right? Hey, you did this good. You did this good. So Cynthia can now start getting her weekly kudos and you could say, Cynthia, you're killing that at this, this, this, you're doing a great job. Thank you. Even if you have to get into the issues, eventually where it comes up like, oh, also I'd like you to work on this type of thing. It started off with the wind and you can end with, you know, again, here's how I can support you kind of thing, which is something you're already doing. So start with the wind. and then you could either get two concerns or questions or the urgent thing. You might kind of play around with that a little bit and find out how that works because here's the thing, you're at the meeting, it's going to get handled. Where it falls in the meeting isn't as important to anything other than the energy of the meeting. So you kind of want to put it where where I like, again, energy sandwiches. I think we talked about these a little bit. I don't remember if we did or not. Good things, bad things, then good things, sandwich. So that's something to think about. And just because it's urgent doesn't necessarily mean it's bad and it may be top of mine and they want to get to the issue quickly. and when still, they don't have to be long winded. want to keep everything as 16th as possible because nobody loves just having meetings. for the sake of meanings. So get in, celebrate the wins, get those kudos, you can do urgent thing, or the concerns or questions, and maybe a concerns or questions specifically for Cynthia, and then concerns and questions specifically for Elsie, and then is there anything that I can do to support you, and then just wrap it up and have a set time. So 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes, probably is all you need, maybe even less depending on how complicated it is, and also if your team is doing a great job of communicating all week long as the issues arise, you don't want to save it for the meaning. Your business doesn't work that way. So they really should be able to be pretty short. The biggest thing is those urgent things if it's on a planned schedule, right? Because you can definitely have have a we needed meeting to get on the same page. right now and so forth, and that wouldn't be the same thing. The structure would be different. That would just be simply a resolution call, right? But this call, if there's an urgent thing that gets brought to the call, then probably it's already been discussed and you're just, you know, getting to the nitty-gritty of it, and basically getting clarity. So those types of conversations, if and so that dialogue back and forth verbally is what allows for that clarity to happen. So other than that, 15, 20 minutes really should wrap it up, and then they know, especially Cynthia, because I think that she really needs that feedback and she really needs that interaction, especially from what I learned about Lorenz, and she really needs that encouragement. That can be a great time for her to do it, but she also seems to respond well to coaching, especially the way that you're doing. doing it so that gives her everything that she needs and now we start compounding that happening every week and then monthly they get one-on-ones it's a little bit more detailed about specific stats we look at this six months from now I and I don't know when you're gonna hit that incentive period where you guys really get to just kind of blow things up but I think your trajectory is gonna be amazing I think that that consistency and that structure based on what you told me about how you've already applied some structure and accountability but also just support I think I think that you'll probably have some pretty stellar results that you'll notice yeah I'm open to that and everybody else has like structured days I just it's weird like sometimes I'll notice like the beginning of the week is kind of slow
01:00:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
So, I'm like, I don't want to do my meeting on like a Monday and everything happens and then we have to wait till Monday to like have another meeting. But I'm thinking like Thursday would be good because we have our firm meetings out Wednesdays.
01:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can also have like a Monday morning email that you send out to everyone if you want to that maybe you dropped it on Sunday night and it's just maybe kind of stayed at the union. Hey, this is where we're at. These are our priorities. We'll have our meeting on Thursday and it could just what you could do is take. So let's say you use like an AI recorder or something or use a record and then and put it in the eyes so you can get some notes, have somebody taking notes. Somebody needs to take notes for sure. Otherwise, it's kind of pointless because you want to be able to track the conversations and you want to track the results because if you don't have data, you're not tracking anything, you're giving it to. human error, which there's going to be human error anyway, but it kind of diminishes the power of those conversations when you're not really tracking what's happening from them. So, somebody taking notes really well or use a recorder, and I can show you how to give it to an AI so they can summarize for you, something like that if you want. If you're nerdy, I'm sure you figure it out yourself. So, but I would recommend doing that. And then you can take those notes, instead of sending them out after the call on Thursday or after meeting because you're in person. Monday, hey, here's a recap of our meeting notes. you know, anything that might have happened between Thursday and Sunday night or Monday morning whenever you send it, you can say, here's a quick little update on a specific case or issue or whatever. And just go team go and we'll, we'll meet on Thursday, let me know if there's anything urgent and then you deal with the urgent things as they come up, but those three structure points. So we're talking about monthly one-on-ones, weekly scheduled meetings, Monday, kind of recap of the call and just additional support, clarity, prioritization, that kind of thing. If you have then something that comes up urgent, just tell them. If something comes up urgent, into my office, let's have a call, let's do whatever, let's meet and get it worked out so that it gets moved and processed and it's not weighing heavily on you or anything like that. And if everything else is being managed well and optimized, you should have the freedom to be able to deal with those types of fires and really give it focused energy so that you can handle it. So additional meetings are totally okay. If you want them, if you need them, but the structure and the committed time just kind of helps everybody say alert and focused and accountable with them, you know? Yep. Okay, so let me know how it goes. It's always a plan to start with it. The reality is everybody's a little different, the teams are different, the feedback is different, but what we do want to do is at least give it a chance to work because week to week, everybody's going through different things, feeling different things, different things happen, that type of thing. So if we could commit to this weekly schedule for at least three months, try to be as committed and consistent as possible. If you're just like, it's really networking, this is a problem, this is not the best way to do it, then let's change it up. the odds are that the structure is definitely going to be more beneficial than not.
01:03:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah, I agree.
01:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I hope you're so glad that you're having these conversations. You didn't answer. just left. Well, you're back and I just bombarded you with a lot of things. But what I would like to know is, and maybe give you some time to think about it, is come back and let me know and you can send me an email. I'd rather not wait until the next one on one. But how you felt about this call, and I think that that's something I need to do. So I'll send you notes about what we talked about and what we're going to work on. But then I would love some feedback from you like, okay, this was useful. This isn't really what I'm looking for. That type of thing so that I can structure this for your best benefit as well. Okay. All right. Do you have any questions?
01:04:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
I don't. excited to go back to the office tomorrow and close out the month strong.
01:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think you're going to do amazing. I'm oh, it's so weird to get emotional about dumb things sometimes. It's not dumb. I like seeing winners win, but I like seeing good people win, especially. And I think that you're on a great track. I think that it's you've got some amazing qualities on a personal level, on a professional level. And I'm really excited to see your career evolve with Sweet Law, because I think that you've got some special qualities that are really good.
01:05:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Like I said, I enjoy the meetings because I'm the type of person that'll just pull my head on work and not really talk about certain things. it's good to kind of have you as somebody I can balance ideas off or someone to tell me, know, you should try this because I'm always open to that.
01:05:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to be the sounding board too, because I'm sure that you have ideas like that. I know your brain is working, you're just really quiet about it, because you're one of those that like, don't talk about it, about it, you just give about it. sometimes like, you know, that's the general rule for the general population, right? But you always have like your internal people that you should and could kind of talk about and riff with. And I know you've been like the lone wolf, but I'll tell you like, I'm 47, I'm about to be 48. I was always the very lone wolf independent, I can do better by myself, whatever. But I'm learning that as you, the bigger you grow and the more you increase your stewardship, right, the bigger teams are, or the more that you have maybe leadership roles in other parts of life, whether it be parenting or coaching or heading up some type of organization or whatever starting your or whatever to do. Being able to tap into other people's strengths, having conversations, peer-to-peer, mentor-to-mentor, or peer-to-mentor that students to mentor, my brain, it's Monday, anyway, but, but getting in the practice of not talking about all things to all people, not being like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, that drives me nuts, too.
01:07:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:07:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But really, you just kind of like, I'm trying to figure out the best word to use, but just contemplating, but kind of co-consomplating, know what I mean, riffing back and forth about what you have stewardship over with somebody that has some kind of understanding about it, and it doesn't necessarily need to be the same type of industry, but leadership to leadership, right? Management to management could be law-to-law, that type of thing. So, just because you're still young and bringing these things in and you'll find that there's just a handful, like you'll be lucky if you get even five of those type of people that you can really, really, really be open with throughout your life. But when you find them, talk about what's in your head because the feedback that you'll get will be very different when you're not just listening but when you're really actively participating and sharing what you think and what even you might feel about some stuff. So anyway, that's just my encouragement to not hold back, not to change how you are quiet, had down things like that. But in small moments, just kind of engage a little bit more at a higher level from time to time and only with specific people so that you can really develop your own leadership at a higher level, because I think that, like I said, I think that you've got innate leadership qualities and that whole iron sharpened iron kind of thing. It's there something to it.
01:09:15 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
Yeah.
01:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:09:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (3)
would you say sorry as a thankfully, Mark, you know, has you as a tool to help all of us and Yeah, really appreciate it.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm glad to do it. I really enjoy it. So anyway, I won't take any more of any more of your time any calm down Another call. Anyway, I hope you have a great day. I'm glad you're back from vacation. I look forward to your report I will send you this email. Maybe not until tomorrow because I have some things. I want to add to it But it but it will be there and then we'll follow up next week Sounds good. All right, you have a great week. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye

> 00:00:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good to see both of you guys.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you guys doing?
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Sleepy.
00:00:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Actually, I'm running for nap.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the time. Yeah, I'm glad we were able to connect today. And Lorenz has been like a year since I've spoken to you, huh?
00:00:46 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yeah, last time we spoke with Sam.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how are you feeling about your numbers? Well, let's see. I have so many questions, actually. They all fight in my brain and want to come out at the same time. so usually I just trip over them and eventually something comes up. Yeah, so let's see, I'm curious about your numbers, although I've been looking at them because I look at them every week with Mark on a whole, not always individually. And I know we have talked about Cynthia and how she works, but now she's on Pat's team, right? Yeah. So let's start with just kind of a recap of what you remember about what we discussed last year. And anything that it's, I don't know that you might have kind of applied or feel like forgot, didn't apply, whatever, your overall thoughts from your experience last year to now.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sure. So I think my real life things is, you know, trying to, I think, struggling managing individual members on the team. And we were working on trying to find everyone's strengths. We can't play to their strengths at the time. And so I've been trying to do that and not apply like a preset system on everybody equally. So I'm using everyone's strengths. You know, I split my, I have two teams, essentially. I have Jessica and Mike and John and Viri. And they, it's the same task. All the same tasks get done. the division of the task is a little bit different from one team to another based on their strengths.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And how do you feel like that works for you? What do you notice about? just day-to-day operations. It could be in terms of cohesion on the team, how people feel like just kind of mood, satisfaction, their own satisfaction. There are so many different nuances to how we perform operations that impact us as people, but also as output. How do you feel like that works for your team?
00:03:34 - Lorenz Schuerch
I think they like the general idea. think the issue that we run into a lot is we have these goals and all five of us are very goal oriented, like knowing the expectations and so we all kind of sit down at the beginning of the month, go through the cases we'd like to set, all cases we'd like to close. And then invariably there's always, you know, it's like every day there's like crises that take away our time. And you know, there's clients that are just about to fire you because I never get a call back and I look into the case and, you know, we're talking to that person every other day. And so it's, you know, it's on some of us a little frustrating because it feels like, you know, the biggest, uh, variables that client themselves.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Um, so that's interesting too. Let me end that.
00:04:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. Like today I spent an hour with a client who, uh, you know, wasn't happy with her conversation with Mike yesterday and I basically said, well, she had a list of questions. And I went through all of her questions one by one and essentially said the exact. same thing Mike told her yesterday, but she was super happy. And, you know, she loves us now. But yeah, to take an hour out of my time out of the things I had to set out to do today, to talk to her and repeat the exact same thing Mike told her yesterday.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, um, that's good information. So I'm going to just kind of recap that the way that it's, well, and we only got to talk once and we've only talked once. We'll around you and I twice, but there was one as a startup and then just a follow up. But so Mark has committed to six months to work together for the three of us. And what I do with my clients is basically just take a holistic approach. So it's a lot of information gathering. And then it's a matter of prioritizing and ranking what we discuss and what we'll have the biggest impact. what's the biggest lover in the business in your day to day operations and things like that. So though we're just starting kind of working together, I've been with Sweet Law for three years. So we've been talking, you know, Mark and I every week for the last three years. And so some of the things that we're working on is going to kind of and overlap. So one of the things that we were talking about trying to figure out is how do we do, how do we create a client ranking system with intake so that we can improve our intake script and process to potentially if even possible because there's such a wide variety of types of cases that you take as well as types of people. And we can't, you know, just cherry pick everything, right? But, but are there ways of determining through potentially profiling and through recognizing through conversation very early through the script, what types of people are going to show up are going to do the work, you know, because there's always a portion where they've got to get us their information and, and do the reporting, will they return our phone calls, will they return our emails, all of those types of things. And so, anyway, not that we have enough information do any of that now, but, but, but all of the things that you share will be useful because then I can go back and we can look at and you guys might find that there are some parallels in what you experience. And one of you might say, well, actually we had that same issue and this is how we did it. So, there's a couple of things just as a general practice that I try to do. with all clients across all business types and it doesn't work uniformly and sometimes it's just not applicable but for example starting up the day proactively versus reactively meaning whatever planning we're doing whatever organizing we're doing and whatever we've prioritized as being the most important thing to accomplish those things get done beginning of the day as quickly as possible so that when we get pulled to the fires you know the things that have to be dealt with in a timely manner have to take time the things that were most important the things that moved the needle the furthest let's say it's a really high high level case right maybe it's a death case and and there's it's higher priority because of the client because of the client's needs and the impact it has in their lives but also what it's worth to sweet-law so What we'll try to figure out is are there ways that we can better structure either our day or the team or our styles of communication with customers or within the team where we have more time and more energy for higher value, higher impact activities, and we're either triaging the lower level stuff. Potentially delegating it. There's a lot of variety. You know how you manage a team, but those are the things that we're going to be looking at, seeing if there's things that we can do to improve. We'll take best practices and then I'll also take some of this information back to Mark and see if there's some feedback where he can help. So point being all of this is discovery. All of this is useful. And that's kind of I just wanted to talk about the approach of how we're going to be doing it since we haven't covered that yet you and I learned and Pat and I did that last week so just make sure this isn't a child it's not in mute everything sorry about that. Okay, so you were talking about. So how many people do you have on your team and I'll have your list right now. I've got four. And remind me who they are please.
00:10:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
So there's Jessica and Mike. And then there's John and Mary.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike are your case managers.
00:10:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, John is a case manager. So they're split into two teams. So Jessica and Mike do mostly the Spanish speakers. And then John. And they're both case managers and then. and John and Vary have more of a traditional split where John does most of the case manager asks and Vary does more of a record request and things like that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two were kind of a pair, weren't they, that are newer to the team? Very, didn't she come from somewhere else?
00:11:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, she came, I think she came from Sweet James maybe, I'm not sure.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was thinking not, but did she and John work together before? No. It wasn't them, okay.
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But Mike and Justin.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mike and Justin, okay. I knew that there was a newer two people that had worked together and kind of came together. Okay. So how do you, when do you have your meetings, how do you meet set your goals like as a weekly, do you have daily meetings, how do you look?
00:12:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
So right now we went through a few iterations and I try to get as much feedback as I get from them. We used to meet as a full team every other day and then the feedback I got was that there's a lot of, when we were going through cases for the other team, the opposite team didn't feel like there's a lot of value so now I'm meeting with individual teams every other day and we kind of do file reviews. We do, you know, if there's any fires to put out, we do those and then we kind of cases along.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been
00:13:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
doing it that way about a month and how do you feel that's going for you it's going good I'm yeah I think I like the idea of doing foul reviews as a team it seems like we're all on the same page at the same time rather than information you know trickling in from different slack channels and we we have a better overall trajectory for each case what what's next you know how do we move this case along faster and you've only been doing this for a month but you you notice the trajectory changing and improving yeah yeah and we have a lot less a lot fewer cases while stagnating
00:14:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that was primarily, would you say, from, um, the file reviews together?
00:14:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
So all five of you doing that? Well, no, because their cases are split up. So like now I do, I do them with the, I do the, okay.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So file rules together per team.
00:14:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
So team.
00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, that's great. I'm, I'm really interested to see how that continues to improve, are you getting good feedback from them?
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
They like that. Oh, they love it. They, I've gotten really good feedback from all four of them. They say they, this is the, the best thing. just. Let's go. Leader.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
job.
00:14:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good job. It took some. Several iterations.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As I said. Yeah. That's the thing about growth, though, it does. It takes several. Okay. Good iterations and you know there are different things that can throw a wrench in it just somebody having a major life event can do it um you know there's there's so many different things because at the end of the day it's just it's people and um we've got a lot going on so um let me keep an eye on the time because I want to make sure we we cover everything I'm really I'm really excited for that so you do you remember reading the book multipliers that we talked about yeah um do you feel like you are staying mindful of um looking for ways to kind of nurture and develop leadership in each of your team members I could be better I could I could do better I used to I used to make time to have like an individual kind of like check
00:16:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
with each cheating team member like once a month and then you know people get sick they took some days off and it just kind of fell out you know a few months ago and to get back on the board especially with a new member very she's super super shy and so that's really hard to get it's like pulling teeth trying to get information out of her.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like that's her all the time or that it's a work situation and she maybe doesn't feel safe in in the work environment to speak her mind?
00:16:44 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not necessarily because you've created that but I see what you're saying you know it's hard for me to say at a distance I know that you know I I know she's a single mom with four kids, so I've always tried to, anytime she has a doctor's appointment or something like that, I to be as accommodating as possible.
00:17:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can relate.
00:17:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Single mom.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:17:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
And so I don't think I've ever said, no, you can't take time off or anything like that.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so as a single mom with four kids, sometimes just risk aversion keeps you from talking. Being afraid of stirring the pot a little bit, causing any kind of conflict, causing any kind of work environment hostility. you say things, you know what I mean? don't rock the boat kind of thing, which is why I was asking you, did you feel like it was more of her personality to not be open and say what she's thinking? Or is it that she's a single mom who can't afford to lose her job? and wants to have a good place to work. So she doesn't rock the boat and saying.
00:18:04 - Lorenz Schuerch
think there could be some of that. And I have four kids, so I kind of get it too a little bit, maybe not to the same extent, but, you know, you want stability when you have kids. You're not looking to job hop. So it's abilities, your primary motivator. And so I think there's some of that. I think there's, you know, it's easy to feel when there's not a ton of parents around you. It's easy to feel like you're not sure if people are gonna understand your needs.
00:18:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna make a note of just something that maybe we can work on some exercises that we can at least experiment and see if it's something that we can, we can. help with because I look at this as most of us don't want to be job-hopping. Most of us would like to kind of have a place where we can nurture and grow and evolve ourselves as well as everyone around us for a long time. And if that's the case, then it's worth investing in every portion of that experience in terms of the skills, including the soft skills, the communication skills, including the relationships between the team members, all of those things. so being able to tap into each person's super powers, their strength, everything that they have inside of their minds, to the point of like what you read in multipliers. Pat, did we talk about multipliers last week at all?
00:19:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
you remember? Yeah, I told you I didn't like to read.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. we'll have an approach. But the promise of the book was, and I think I did touch this, which is that you want to nurture the leadership in everybody that's on your team, so that basically everybody's playing at their best levels, and that you can create autonomy. Like you were talking about Cynthia, you needed to walk her through some things so that she would know just to get the job done, right? These are the things that don't sit around and wait to be told that type of thing. Like that's multiplying, that's making her more valuable, and there were things that Lorenz did as well to work with her. So that's just the thing is noticing where somebody might be pulling punches a little bit, might be holding back a little bit, or somebody might just not be having the support that they need to be able to to do what they can do. So as we go through our meetings each week, it's just kind of looking and going, oh, I noticed this thing. And some of it is just going to be human nature. None of us are perfect. None of us are going to do amazing at all the things all the time. But some of the things we can make, even if it's a 1% improvement, a 5% improvement, sometimes a 15% improvement. And then you start compounding 1% over here, 5% here, 10% here, another 1 over here. And then all of these different improvements, of them micro level, some of them macro level. And then you look at that a year later, and you look backwards and go, wow, this is amazing. Look at how steady we are at these numbers. Look at how happy everyone is. Look at how well everyone's working together. I used to have to say this to somebody every single week. now I really don't know. I'm to have to say anything to them about it, like little things like that, that just make the quality of your work day better, a little bit less stressed, not just for you, but for your teammates, which tends to end up coming out for the clients, which makes their experience a little bit better, generally will impact the numbers so that your bottom line revenue is higher without feeling more stressed because of it. So, they're very subtle things. There's nothing that you go, holy cow, that's an amazing whiz-bang like, you know, did that come from? It's nothing like that. It's just a little micro adjustment here and there that you look back at it and go, this is better. For example, around your goal last year to start improving your numbers, how are they compared to where you were at the beginning of 2023 versus now?
00:22:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's that like for you? I've been trying to work on... I'm quicker turnaround. think I had a couple of first quarter. I had a couple of rough months. One was kind of rough because of money in and then the following one was rough because of settlements, which doesn't make sense. You would think it'd be the other way around. that took a big chunk out of my confidence. I kind of like try to reset myself, reset the team expectations and try to press on the gas pedal. The numbers could be my goal every month as a minimum. of $600,000 and I haven't hit that in a couple of months, so I've been just disappointed. And then there's a couple of factors as of looking at that and State Farm has been just really awful to deal with this year. putting the brakes on everything I've got. Probably out of the 20 cases I have in negotiations right now. 10 of them are State Farm and they're offering less than meds. mean, I don't know about you Patrick, but they're just, they seem to be just slowing everything down, just gumming up the words. And it, it's just, it takes so much time.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you noticed anything that sounds out about State Farm for you?
00:24:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Same compliance as like the cases. Those cases take the most time to get resolved and it's like, and it's crappy results. Yeah, like the, to the firm, it's like the lowest result of like, sometimes I'm like, it's better. We don't even just drop the case and I'd rather put more time into X case that's going to bring in 30K to the firm because, I mean, I just resolved one now. It's like the case settled for nine grand. We're going to take like two, like, I spent so many time just trying to reach somebody there. Clients pissed off because it took so long and the numbers like not even anything, you know, you would think somebody was going to wait five months for a case in negotiation would be getting like at least 10 to 12K in their pocket.
00:25:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's to the point where, when I see in the intake channel that the defendant's insurance estate farm, I get anxiety and I'm like, if it's not a broken bone, I don't really want it. Because I know it's just going to be such a struggle.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really. really good to know. don't know ethically that we'll want to avoid those, but maybe, you know, because we talked about client ranking, but maybe there's a case ranking system that we have. And maybe, I don't know, I want to talk and brainstorm this with Mark and see if there's a different way that we handle it. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:26:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Because I look, the main issue and Patrick talked about is it takes just as long to manage a small soft tissue case as, you know, for a state farm as it does to manage something a little bit more serious for GEICO, for example. But the state farm case, I know if I get the meds, it's like party time, we've we've won kind of thing where with GEICO, we can pop the policies
00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All day long It's also hard to game plan those state farm cases because even if you do all the right things like that mark has taught us on how to work up a case It like that just doesn't apply what state farm for some reason. I know the friends has cases where you know even The client got injections in the medical You know the offers like not even half the medical expenses like it just doesn't make sense And that's a case that you work up just like any other case would and you know The other one settles and gets done and this one you're still stuck like asking the most basic questions to the adjuster like why is your offer X amount and you get like Seven eight of the state farm cases now You know based on marks the stuff he sees this case It doesn't have any negotiations for X amount of months. The client's pissed off. It just snowballed into the time sucking machine. And then when it does get resolved, it's not even worth half the time that we spent on it. But to completely bar every state farm case from coming into the firm, I don't know if that's the right move.
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think it would be practical. We can't lose that many, but we might be able to change the way that we process them. And I don't know, like, even maybe a team or a system dedicated to it, or just even just having an awareness. There sometimes there might be a conversation that Mark can have. Maybe there's a representative. I don't know, but...
00:29:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It starts with having awareness.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has there even been a conversation among the attorney is or with Mark that state farm stands out so badly?
00:29:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, every week, every week.
00:29:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
I can bring it up every week.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does he say about it?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
He says, well, it's you know, you can always have someone else second voice and things like that. I've had other people second voices. had Patrick second voice. I've had Sam, I've had Nick. And usually it results in an additional thousand bucks. And it's I'm not going to like bulk at that because I know if we get enough extra thousand dollars eventually builds up or whatever. So go ahead, sorry. And I feel like. Like where's my value as an attorney to the client?
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
If I'm getting them. the meds paid for, basically.
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, at the very least, one thing I wanna do, and I don't think it's in our, I don't know if it's in our reports, it's not on my dashboard, but I would like to see matters by insurance companies and look at what the volume is across insurance companies in terms of how many cases we get how many times we hit max policy limits. Just drill down on that a little bit more. We'll be interesting. And sometimes, so to the point of getting disheartened, sometimes you just have to put things in perspective and just say, is it, and not let it get to you. pause, you know, there's there's all kinds of science on the psychology when you just you focus on on the problems, especially the things that you can't control, it impacts the rest of your mood, it impacts your energy, it's going to impact your cognitive abilities, simply because your mind is over here wrestling the frustration.
00:31:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, but the metric that we're measured by is our average fee.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, I get that and so but here so so this is part of why I want to have the report so I can look at statistically if everybody is averaging roughly the same amount of state farm cases so then we would look at is there any possible way and I doubt it that somehow intake is you know one team gets more of that and one team doesn't it's not very likely that that's the case. So that means that if everybody's getting right roughly, and throughout the year, it probably is. The same amount of state farm cases, then it really is not a determining factor, right? Because you would all be dealing with the same problem. And so, if Samantha, so I'm looking, I asked Mark this and I did not get the question, but you guys get to see each other's numbers, right? You know what everybody's attorney fees are, roughly. so I'm going to look at this for this year. Let me update it. So, Lorenz, for the year of 2024, your average attorney fee is 11,000. We're not going to look at Mark or Nick, because obvious reasons. Pat, you're at 8.8k, Sam's at 17k, Tyler's at 11k. So, you and Tyler are tied Lorenz. If I look at that for last month for June, which is a very small pool and not really a good way to look at it, for last month your 8.4k, Sam was 12k, Tyler was 9.3k, Pat, your 7.6k. A month is, I mean, it's not a good sample size because of how long your cases take to work up and to settle. And let me look at record counts. So, wait, that was last month. wanted to do this for the year. So, cases closed by team for this year. Lorenz 125 for you. Pat, you're at 59. is a 120, so learns you close more cases. Again, how long they start is not necessarily a good thing. Just a second, please. have a child. Teenagers, and I work from home, so like, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Okay, so, click cases close by team. Lorenz, 125, is for 2024, Pat, 59, 120, then, that number's 100% not correct, gross the, oh, that's by state, I'm fine. Resolution by team. My average attorney, we already did that. Dropouts and subouts. Lorenz, your percentage of subouts. Let's see, subouts as they fired you or is that dropped out?
00:35:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, subout is when they hired different attorneys.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
difference I guess. So, your percentage is rough. That can't be right. Hold on. Let me make sure this year. I'm not positive. Okay, okay. I need to change this report because I want to see it per all the cases that you have. But for the year, you only had five subouts. Samantha had 13. Pat had... three. Tyler had seven. Now, there's a lot of reasons that can happen. It can be your performance. It could be the insurance. It could be multiple things. And they're blaming us for it, not necessarily because of something you and your team have done. But there's a lot of things to look at in terms of your quality and performance and how you do the job. It isn't just attorney fees. That is what your incentive pay is. But all of these things impact sweet lot. Getting subbed out. And I can't so one on sub out. And one out. Percentage for cases. And policy limit for that case, potential loss, because I think that we should be measuring the loss for team two. And then this isn't about penalizing anyone. It's about making sure that we're evaluating everything. So, let's say that your attorney fees are lower, first of all, you're operating primarily in Arizona, and I don't know. All of you are, so Samantha waved into, I don't remember New Mexico, I think she's New Mexico. Who's doing Texas, do you remember? Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. So, you know, there's different things impacting your numbers, and all of that needs to be taken into account. So, at the end of the day, Really, the thing is we want to look at each of those numbers, just your attorney fees, but we want to look at the sub-out rate. We want to look at policy limits. We want to look at how often is your team showing up and doing well, how happy are they because that has an impact on the likelihood that we're going to have to replace somebody soon. We have to replace somebody because the pod leader, the attorney, is burning people out. It's very difficult to find good people to hire. We are constantly looking and we go through a lot just to find one new attorney. So, again, my approach is holistic. I'm looking at everything in Sweetlock top to bottom, never just the bottom line. I'm looking at each individual, I'm looking at them as a person. I'm looking at all the costs, all the impact. act, all the wins, all the losses, and and how it affects everything because ultimately each of these things makes an impact on how profitable it is, including how happy everybody is. So if you learn to measure all the things that matter, not just your attorney fees, but like I think you should be happy with the fact that your subout rate is so low, I think that that's important. I think that that means that you're probably doing something good. However, what I don't have and what I need and why I need to change this report is I don't have that in relationship to how many cases you had this year. So Samantha, if she, so her subout rate is more than double yours, but if her case rate is more than double yours, then she's roughly in the same boat, you know what I but. Yeah, so anyway, those are some of the things to look at, Pat, you're coming up and now you've got those goals, trying to, so I'm just going to tell you Lorenz, Pat's gone in for being the best attorney in the firm, so we've got some competition in here, but I think it's good, I think it's good. I think how we handle the competition, like Samantha, she's leading in attorney fees, but when Pat asks her questions, she answers them, and thoroughly, really supportive in answering that. And so ultimately, if all of our goal is, how do we make the sweet law be the best place to work, the best place to go for help? Well, you know, I think that's winning, right? job security is, if you show up and you're continually improving, maybe you're not improving an attorney fees for... or three months. But maybe what you did was improve your team processes. You improved. You made sweet lot better. And that's important. So we're going to have those conversations too. And also going to take that and report back to Mark, like the fact that you figured out through multiple iterations and different processes and effort and communicating with your team that your trajectory improved because you split the teams instead of having people sitting around, wasting their time on meetings that are irrelevant to them, doing bio reviews per your groups. That's important. Sweet lot was improved because of that effort. So maybe it doesn't have an immediate impact on the attorney fees, but it will over time, 100%. There's no way that's not going to. And if we get to continue working together, so here's the other thing.
00:41:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Q1 here. Yeah, I guess I might. I am competitive, but I'm more competitive with myself, so always compared to myself to one career.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's best way to be, honestly, because that's the only race you can run, but I like both of them. I think ultimately that's the only race you can control and that you're really actually in, but with Pat, know, wanting to get the highest numbers, like I get that too. The bottom line is whatever motivates us, that's what we need to tap into. That's what we need to be working with. So what everybody has different drivers, and as long as there's intrinsic motivation and drive, that's all we need. There are people that don't have it. They're only externally motivated to please other people, to get accolades, to earn money, but mostly so they can show up things, not because they want to improve themselves, not because they actually want to be the best at anything they just want to be. he perceived as the best. Pat wants to be good at what he does. You want to be good at what you do. And that's valuable. But I want to make sure that you did hear me. All of Sweet Law is slow and Q1.
00:43:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Did you know that? No.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every year, I've watched it. Every year, every year, have a little bit of a freakout period. Mark has a little bit of a freakout period. And then everything turns around and we're like, oh yeah, this is a pattern. But I will tell you that Mark didn't know it was a pattern because Mark didn't track his numbers. And when I would ask him for his numbers, he would say, well, I think it's this. And I think it's that. And I said, none of what you say adds up. So how about we go get that information? Yeah, but it's a pain in the . don't know how to get it.
00:43:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
And like, well, let's figure that out, Mark.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we did. And so now we've got some data and the more that we dig into it. Um, so we'll go get some information and all of a sudden, you know, nothing's really happening and then Mark sends an email because he can't sleep a night because he was thinking about something and he had an epiphany and he dug into some numbers and he's like, I just realized this. And then we have a big change and there's a big improvement and so really digging into all of these different numbers makes a difference. But something that I really love about numbers is it kind of takes the emotions out of it and in a good way. Um, because you see what's real numbers don't lie. Numbers tell you the truth. So if you see some good numbers, what do you know? You know that that's, that's a real thing. That's a good thing. If you see a number you don't like, it's also a real thing, but that's an opportunity to improve. And iteration upon iteration changes happen and occur. So, that's what we're looking at. So one thing I'm really excited about though by talking to you guys as I'm realizing how we can improve our reporting which is going to be really useful for us and what we're doing with Mark which will somehow come back and improve things for you including potentially improve because I don't know that we have the best incentive program that there is I want to make sure that you guys are incentivized for all the good work that you do including if we're minimizing dropouts and subouts I think that that should be part of it. Especially if the reason that we're getting subbed out is lack of communication and so this was something that really isn't managed super well I think across any team. I think it's getting better but we would have some cases where nobody been communicated with for two and a half months which is not acceptable and until I I was asking questions and probing and digging into that. That was just like that and it was unknown. So there's always opportunity to improve. And just by having the conversations, we figure out ways to, because you guys have a lot of watch, you have a lot of things to manage, you have a lot of people, a lot of processes, a lot of conversations that will fry the average person's brain every day. So dropping the ball is kind of part of the job, it's going to happen. we're trying to do is create the systems that minimize ball dropping. know what I mean? That also maximize making sure that we're spending the most time on the most important things, the highest leveraged impact type thing. And that we're making air pre-person on the team as potent as possible so that everybody's winning. So, um, okay, we've got about 15 minutes left and then Lorenz, um, before I forget, let's just go ahead and get out next week's schedule because next week will be just you and me.
00:47:21 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I thought we said next Wednesday, same time.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did we? Okay, uh, that will work. Let me just, I think I just didn't schedule it yet. Let me duplicate this. What is the calendar? No, that's not it. That will work. That will work. You don't have to deal with All right. Okay, so that's done. So Pat, Mr. Patrick, um, have you had any thoughts since our conversation last week?
00:48:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
The main thing that stood out was like the male, female dynamic. Um, it was obviously two of my team members or females. Um, we kind of touched on like how the male dynamic can help them like a camera with what you said. But like, I remember you talked about the dynamic between male and female team. Um, I want to see how I can use that to maximize. Um, because the team is super respectful. Um, you know, we don't have any issues. Sometimes I feel like there might be issues with the female case manager and answering to a male attorney, I'm not sure why, but that was like the main thing that really stood out. So I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on like naturally what's the dynamic like.
00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just even observing dynamics between people, there are going to be different things, the female female dynamic, especially if they're super strong, A type personalities in the workforce can be very either they're going to be very supportive of each other or tear each other apart. There's not a lot of middle ground generally speaking. So the first thing is just observing what kind of dynamics exist. Who do do two people interact with each other and seem to be more open when they interact with each other versus interacting with other people? Do you notice any tension? Do you notice more forthcoming, more holding back? type of thing. What I was saying about you is that you have a, so the way that you approach Cynthia, I think Lorenz is the same type of way, is that he wants to bring out the best in people. You want to support them. That doesn't exist everywhere with every person. Not every female comes to work and feels safe, either because of anybody that work or one. And men of the, you know, not necessarily safe, but it impacts, it'll show up in a woman a little bit differently in terms of how much she will lead and share what she knows is gonna help things. So one of the things that I do and have done for several CEOs is higher higher. and install a right hand person for them, more than an assistant, somebody who kind of like pushes back on them a little bit and says, did you think about this? Hey, I noticed you said you were going to do this, but you're not doing this. That type of thing, right? Now, that was what they were hired for. That was their exact role. That was what was wanted from the CEO, somebody to push back little bit and hold them accountable because there's nobody doing that in the business. And we all need somebody to hold us accountable. But without fail, even though that person was told clearly, please call out when you see issues, please call that out every single time as often as possible. And even when they did that and they never got pushed back, even when they were fully respected every time, it took years for them to feel safe enough to do the job well. Because generally speaking, That's not how the rest of the world operates. Most people don't want to be how accountable. Most people don't want to be called out even respectfully. There's ego involved, right? You both come off to me as someone who is not operating from a you're coming off a little harsh or something like that. But more importantly, the energy that comes from that is that you're safe to be around. You care about the people that work for you and work with you. Here's how I knew that from you, Pat. Without being prompted, you were talking about how you noticed Cynthia was not doing X, Y, don't remember all the details of it, but I remember you're like, I tried to give her space so that she could just do her thing and not, you know, control her basically. But you noticed that. that wasn't working. And so you knew that she needed more support, she needed guidance, she needed to be directed. And so you did that. But what you told me was I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I didn't want to, you know, cause her any problems or make her uncomfortable. So I just took my time and this is the approach that I took. So you showed that you were concerned with how she felt and that you took the time to modify the way that you showed up in order to create a safe space for her. I'm going to tell you, and Lorenz, I think that you would do the same kind of thing. I think that that's how you operate primarily is being concerned with giving people what they want. And you've given other signals like that, same thing with Cynthia, noticing that she's process oriented and everybody else is kind of free. so you gave her some tasks to allow her to create those processes. also when your team told you, look, we don't like wasting our time, like, okay, let's make a modification split this and I'll just go ahead and do two file reviews even though maybe it's more tedious for you, you were there to lead your people the way that they wanted to be led. What I'm trying to explain to you guys and what I really want you to hear, and this is not a platitude or patronizing or anything, that is not how most leaders operate. Most people are more bosses, they're not leaders. You both show up as leaders because you care about how the people that work for you feel you want them to be happy and successful and even if it's not altruistic, even if the only reason you're doing that was because then they'll perform better for you and you get better paid. Let's say that was all it was and I know that it's not. It still gets the same end result, they're still taking care of. So paying attention to how people respond to you. I'm noticing, for example, if Viri doesn't maybe answer questions if you ask her how things are going. want to drill into that with you next week a little bit more Lorenz and get the details so that maybe I can kind of figure out what's going on a little bit and we can find a way for that. But generally speaking, that's going to be that she's received signals from other bosses or leaders that have said, you know, if you tell me too much, it's going to annoy me and I'm going to give you some annoyed energy and you're going to feel that tension and that hostility and she has taken that and gone, you know what, I'm going show up, I'm going do my job, I'm going to go home and that's it. And I'm not going to rock the boat because I don't want to deal with feeling threatened with my job or anything like that. So, um, paying attention to these types of things, being aware of them, and also paying So guys, what I want you to understand is knowing how unique you are, that you have an opportunity to really improve, especially when you have females working on your team. Because you are safe, because you do care, you can probably get better performance out of them than they've ever had before. But if you want to know the impact that it makes, and maybe this doesn't motivate you, but I'll tell you this anyway, you can help them show up better in the rest of their lives completely by showing them that there are safe people in the world where they can make mistakes, they can say the wrong thing, and they can still be okay. You know what I mean? Because if you have people willing to make mistakes out loud, then the mistakes can be seen in the open, which means they can be corrected gently, but they can be corrected. Whereas if you have people who feel like they need to cover up their mistakes. Who need to lie about them or just not show you, you know, what's weak within them? You can't correct it. You can't improve it. Does does any of this make sense? Yeah, absolutely so I'll give you an example of where I learned and then we can kind of close it and I was inquire for like ever and and We would be learning new songs and they were difficult songs and my my Quaritage was always trying to get us to sing louder and So he could hear so he could pick out the part so he could see like he's I could hear there's an off note But I don't know where it's coming from because every time I walk by everybody's mumbling and they're not really right So I'm just like, you know what I'm sure you can imagine I was loud I Don't do quite or settle very well, but um, so I did that and it was frustrating because I would get corrected but I would get corrected quick and you know what happened after that, I nailed the part and then I'd be a section leader and everybody would start listening to me. So when I would join in any other choirs, church choirs, whatever adult activities and every other thing, I'll just be loud. I'll just make my mistakes out loud. I have opinions, I'm very secure in my opinions and loud about them when I say them and confident in them, knowing that if I'm wrong, somebody's going to correct me and I will not like that, by the way, do not like being corrected. But I prefer being corrected to being wrong perpetually. Do you know what I mean? So I'm okay with being confidently wrong so that somebody who knows better can observe it and go, yeah, no, that's not right, Tina. This is actually what you need to do. So I try to create that kind of space for people that work with me. as well and encourage them, just go do things. If you make a mistake, we're going to figure it out together. But if I don't have to tell you and train you on every little thing because you're not afraid to try it, you're not afraid to problem solve, you're not afraid to explore, you're not afraid to go look for other solutions and implement them knowing it could cost us money, it could cost us time. But knowing that the end result is we're going to get more knowledge and we're going to have a deeper understanding of how these things work and you got it for yourself and you made yourself more valuable to me. But I'm paying you the same amount of money. Go learn, go explore, go figure some things out. But then when they do that, they start getting more brave and they want to explore more things and they want to try more things and they bring more things to the table and then they stay with me for years and I get to keep benefiting from this all because I was like, go ahead and make mistakes. Like it's powerful. But, you have to make it very clear that it's a safe place to make mistakes. It's a safe place to tell what you really think, as long as it's done respectfully. And if it's done disrespectfully, then you just correct it respectfully. But we're looking at this long term, your people evolving. And the other thing that I'll tell you is that these skills and these things, they'll help you as parents, if you're a coach, they'll help you as a friend, any other place you show up as a leader. When you learn how to create a safe space for people, but also help them be their most powerful selves, everything that you do, everywhere that you serve, everywhere that you show up and have any kind of interactions, improves because you will be one of the few places in the world where somebody is safe to show up and have some room to make mistakes. So that they can explore and. and learn. And it's, I think it's pretty awesome. I mean, I love watching people grow. love knowing that I had a little bit of a part of it. And the two of you have both demonstrated that you have that kind of interest and awareness and ability. And Pat, you've got a strong like shoulder spore things just kind of roll off you. Lorenz, I think you get a little bit more anxious and stressed out about it, but you still take it into you rather than putting it on them. And so, and if we can teach you how to let stuff roll off you a little bit better, that would be good. But at the end of the day, you both offer very unique things to your teams where there's a lot of potential and growth. And I think that Sweet Law is going to be, I think Sweet Law is blessed for having both of you. But if we can keep working on these things together, I'm looking at some awesome stuff coming down the road.
01:02:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
and some good numbers and of course you know you want to get that extra money and you've got those goals so we'll get to them too through the people that you're working with and just through day-to-day ops so um Pat before we wrap up so we were talking about dynamics beyond female dynamic and you said that's what you were thinking about do you have more questions do you have more thoughts like did you want to dig into that a little bit more now um i had another can i give you like another thing i was thinking yeah um how to keep them motivated because obviously like their cap on you know financial like improvement is kind of limited because just the nature like we have our licenses and we're attorneys and like your salary or whatever can just you know it's kind of like sky's the limit whereas with you you know, non-licens staff here, it's kind of like, there's kind of a ceiling, um, and I'm sure they know that, but they, which is why I applaud and I appreciate all the work that they do, because I mean, Lorenz and I was like, they take a big blunt of the work that we don't want to do, you know, just even taking the calls every day, it's like, one day if Elsie's not here, and like, it kind of falls back on me, it's like, pay this woman what she needs to be paid to be happy and keep her here as long as possible, because like, you know, they really do a lot of the work that, you know, as an attorney at some point you want to negotiate and get the settlements, which is the fun part. So just like trying to keep them motivated and happy to be coming to work every day, because like I said, they do a lot of the work and, you know, I don't know how much they make, but in obviously Lorenz and I have like the room to really grow whereas other staff members is kind of like a range because for me it was in that position like I don't know if I would have lasted as long as, know, people have doing the work that they do.
01:04:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
So what I've done with my team is I've made my growth commence written affairs so we have certain bonus ladders where if we bring in this much money that month I'll take money out of my paycheck to bonus the people that and then that way they feel just as invested in the success as I do.
01:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. But I thought that that was that the incentive program, so I guess maybe I was just probably thinking about intake because I know intake. takes incentive is combined like there's no way to separate it because each of them can touch a case multiple times before it becomes a case and before it's turned over to you because I've been trying to figure out how do I create some separation so that we can really measure and reward according to effort because not everybody shows up the same and I think that it should be based off of effort and ability but I didn't realize that the pods were separate like that that the case managers and assistants don't get incentive pay is that correct like not unless you're too mean right so that's some questions that I have because I would like to see that be consistent across sweet law I think that that would be better for the company but we've not had this conversation would like to have that with Mark. So that was a good point, Pat.
01:06:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
will bring that up.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My staff hasn't complained about, hey, this is just something internally that I was. No, yeah, yeah. That's good. I'm glad you brought that up and I'm glad you're thinking about that because I would think the same thing. know, if you're incentivized and they're not like, there's obviously ceiling to how much you can ask for them when they don't get more for it. I, for sure, I'm motivated by incentives and if I'm not getting more for working harder, guess what I'm not going to do.
01:06:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like, don't go put that up for somewhere else that comes back. the end of the day, was not going to want to get paid more, know, but there's just one of those things I was thinking about because, you know, on those hard days, when you, you know, on by clients all days, it's like, I'm going to come to work the next day and then, you know, what's my financial future like, you know, whereas for me and Lorenz, you know, we can suck it up and, you know, get yelled at by clients, but you have a really good month and it's like, You know, this is why why I put up, you know, yeah, so just you know I want to make sure that For the long term the team is happy and you know despite their They've been like in certain range. They can have other things to look forward to and be happy about Well, that's like a couple hundred dollars incentive every month.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know it's not very much that takes to Yeah People yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so that's good was there anything else?
01:07:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I didn't answer that I've been to look into that I don't think so I think the The three of us on the calls would be helpful because I can get some more detail on how Lorenz you know organizers team and everything because I'm just free styling I see some stuff that Sam does Tyler does from Lorenz But obviously these are more in-depth calls so No, I'm excited.
01:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm glad and I'm really glad that you said that because I wasn't sure how I want to structure this. I thought that one on one a month and then to all of us meetings a month would be best. So I think that that would be good. Still that way we can talk about your team specifically on an individual basis. So that's what the one on one call would be to really dive into the nuances of your specific people. And then twice a month, you could really just do some back and forth best practices digging into Sweet Long General.
01:08:36 - Lorenz Schuerch
So how do you feel about that Lorenz? Does that work for you? That's great. I'm always, I always want to grow. I always want to do better. So I'm happy to just follow your lead and hopefully settle off. A lot more cases and have happy teams.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I think, I mean, just the thing that you did with the file review, I'm really looking forward to seeing how that goes. Pat, your team is going to be growing eventually. mean, you're definitely gun, and I'm watching your line grow. So it's good. I think you guys are awesome. I'm so excited to be doing this. Thank you for spending some time with me and letting me come in and do this work with you guys. So Lorenz, I will meet with you next week. And then Pat and Lorenz will will reconvene, not next Wednesday, but the Monday after that at 3 p.m. Sounds good.
01:09:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You send emails, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every time like we're about to have a meeting? Yeah, you should get a notification through Google. And I have it set by default to send multiple reminders. But I don't know that the multiple reminders go to you. So, starting a day or yesterday. So what I'll tell you. though is so in the beginning we didn't have a set time but we're going to so what you can do is once I set that recurring Monday meeting call which I'll do by next week at the latest because we're doing Wednesday next week what you can do is go into your calendar and set up your own reminders to be whatever frequency level you want but I have mine going one day before just to kind of remind me it's a thing I do with all of my meetings and then four hours before and 15 minutes before just so that I remember because I've got a lot going on so I need other reminders but if you need anything else if you want other kinds of reminders let me know I probably will start getting to some point where there's some follow-up questions that I'll ask through email just to make sure that we're on track but right now there's a lot of just downloading everything from you guys so we're not getting to that point yet uh yeah so any other questions did you fix your pool my daughter is working on it right now because i just work hard yang are you in california no i'm in northern southern cal southern organ i want to say northern california southern organ southern yeah look now why is it more again oh we're at beaverton oh that's much nicer i live in the hictown and i cannot wait to move i'll be moving though every single night because i like oh we're at um probably the scott still area it's either that or vegas but yeah stop still it's very nice yes i like it very much all right you guys well i hope you have an amazing fourth of july i hope you have a great weekend and i look for

I cannot tell you how many times I am just picking up my phone to text you and then you log it.
00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's like the internet stop working. I'm like, I'm disconnect the Wi-Fi and now I'm getting bombarded with like, hacks and I think I'm show you what going to show you.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was behind the camera, so I can't show you this, but I'm going to show you what I did and got home at midnight last night after having done. Hold on, cuz it was crazy, damn, where'd go, here, this, you have an iPhone so I can just send a bunch, use bunch of grandma's, well not everybody was a grandma, one was not a grandma, but I am. And now I have two grandchildren, let's see, this one and this. also that so that you can see we climbed a mountain yesterday at a top of a rock and there was legit rock climbing with no equipment and some of it was pure vertical and the only way I got up there was wedging myself between rocks and arm strength because I was too short to get the foot holds and hand holds that on that rock that mountain yes it was three and a half miles there and back and we watched the sunset on top of the mountain and we could see two volcano mountains from where we were that were a hundred miles away on one side and one hundred miles away on another side and then we climbed down in the dark with headlamp so I was in trumpet AF last night mmm that was a wild that was fun it was cool how to share Uh, hey, how did you talk to Lisa at all?
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I sort of did, but not really. No, she's like in Jackson Hole or something. So she kept dropping out. So she was like driving through Nevada or something to Wyoming. We're not what the hell she's doing. So I just gave up.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much of that and that is just dead zone.
00:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so she was like, I lose you right here, losing him. I was like, and then it was like, no, here. No, no, no, wait, no. And then it actually got cut off and I was like, no worries. Oh, I don't know when she's coming back. think my mom told me, but I'm scared of me.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, um, so where's my notes, notes, she. So let's start with basis. How's that going since last week?
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
with Frank yesterday and they kind of they be I'm a second visa or I'm a second visa and Eric like who all met exactly the second.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:03:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All of them. Okay.
00:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're all but Norio.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah.
00:03:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. they were they were just trying to like like the like imagine Frank is like the blocks expert, right? So he's unlike the cutting edge of all that, right? And WordPress will like change the name of something and Frank adopts it immediately. He's like, oh, it's called this now. So like some of the some of the names we're using are not what they are now. So when he hears, but the word still is around.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just has a new meaning.
00:03:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what we call a pattern, for instance, this is true, but let's say it is, what we call a pattern is now called a layout, and a pattern is now something else. So they got together and they said, hey, we think there's some confusion around, like we need to make sure we're on the same page about what these things mean, or make sure that we're all using this to correct terms, right, because we think that we say this, and it turns out they were right. So it was like, okay, so they got the same page about that. And then they brought him up to speed on some of the other stuff that he was confused about, like, hey, why are you using a cloud? Why do you want to use a cloud library for this? how are you doing this? Eric's like, I think we got it, like, we definitely got it now. he's like, I think he was impressed even more. was like, oh, okay, got it. So then they said, for now, like, ranks, sort of like coming at it from a long term approach, like, Hey, you know, when you have a hundred clients, you're gonna want to be have this. And he focuses sort of in there. And they're like, we appreciate that. But we want to, we need to be working on the short term rather than the long term.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we work on the short term.
00:05:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And for us, the short term is being able to do XYZ, whatever. he's like, got it. Okay, yeah, it's like, it's not that we don't want to do what you're talking about. It's like, we don't need that now, we need that then. But let's do the now, now and then then. And then Eric today was like, he was like, Hey, I just want to let you know, like, if it would be possible to keep him around for like once a month calls, like once we get this stuff out of the way is like to keep him around as an advisor for some sort, he's like, I think that would be super beneficial. I said, sure.
00:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thinking about having. Yeah, more long term anyway.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, okay, no, because I don't, I wouldn't assume that that was possible. So he never mentioned anything about like a monthly engagement or anything like that. All that he has said to me was, Hey, maybe maybe when we're done with this, you could help me sell my stuff. Or do you know how to do that? I'm how to do this. Maybe there's mean we can work either like that. And funnily enough, Eric was today, before I said this, Eric, Eric was like, man, if Frank used our stuff, he'd sell so much more of his course or whatever.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like his check out and all his stuff is terrible.
00:06:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the code is good, right? So it's like, he's like, he's good at code, like really good. So that's the threat. So now they were like, this is what we want, we want to be able to do. These are the things, the problems that we have, let's resolve these problems. ones. So an example would be when we import a cloud template, make sure that it adopts all the styles, being able to set the global styles so that when you add a block or a gravity form or whatever, it adopts all of those. So that's what they're working on. And then showed him why it might not be the best solution for some of the that he's talking about, or we can do it like this. And he was like, oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense too. So yeah.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, the goal is still to get wolf or done by October, okay. And the G4, the journey, how are we doing?
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there's something wrong with one of our plugins. have to, I set up a test yesterday because I implemented our lead tracking on CMA. I'm for sure getting leads from ads and what I'm seeing, those events are not firing in, oh, you know what it is, the GTM container. I have to go to the container. It's not finally the container.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I just figured it out. What is CMA?

The certified management accounting exam.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we launched that site, whatever, like a year ago. It's. been steadily getting sales. So then I purposely tried to get leads. I'm getting like two or three leads a day right now. But they are not going up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. But I think I just can't a step. Do you know?
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you cannot, Dan. You cannot skip a step.
00:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I followed the swap that I created. I would have realized I'd skip a step and I'd just get it on the fly. Did you follow the process? I did not. No wonder I didn't work.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did So what else in that journey, what else did you want? I don't know what else did you do related to G4.
00:10:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Melissa is that she'll have all the stuff reviewed by the end of the day today. then she wanted to meet tomorrow. I'm not sure I can because I didn't think this stuff was tracking. But now I do think that stuff is tracking. So I need to go also saw something else weird yesterday that to go look at. Like there was an event firing in CMA that technically shouldn't be unless the way I defined it was URL based. And I said something like, hey, anytime a URL has SP in it, which would be a sales page, then do this. And if that's the case, then it would be correct. That is not the case that it's incorrect. And if that is the case, then I should have seen two other events and I didn't. So either the one event has messed up something's wrong, I think. So I have go look at that because the stuff that she's going to build is based off these three events firing on the sales page. But it would be that only a ninja because they just got a custom set up. It could and should be that they do fire on all sales pages across domains because they're not in any way product specific or page specific other than sales page is like this.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The should only throw in a sales page.
00:11:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm going to go make sure that a they're actually all firing correctly on ninja CPA. And if they're not, then I can't be with her because they're needed to build the report. If they are, then I can be like, okay, yeah, let's jump on a call and do at least one. Let's just do that one. Just broken the fix.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still going to like the custom JavaScript version of his thing, which is custom JavaScript, which I do not do, but I'm going to learn how.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. What does that allow you to do?
00:12:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's going to allow me to fire custom events based on custom documents, right? So the JavaScript says sort of like an if this, then that. If this happens, then fire writes out an example would be using that to fire my new customer event. So I'd say hey, if this is a new customer, then fire a new customer event. There's nothing built into GAPore or the GTN plugin or Woo that's made for that. So it's going to allow me to do this custom JavaScript.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see what those events are and so if you can't do it in GA4 or custom JavaScript, can you give me an example of the event?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I think of that and think you can do it with custom JavaScript. It's not going to be a default event, so a default event in GA4 would be a form submit, they have a built-in event that I see firing that I didn't set up, so a custom event would be not default, it's not built-in at all, and then it's also you're defining it, right?
00:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, like for example, was it be scrolling to a certain page?
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it add the card? Is it add the card?
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, yeah, all those are all those are built in.
00:14:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's fine. Yeah. So it's outside of those and then it can be completely custom, like new customer. No one is going to be, I mean, I'm not going to say no one, but probably very few people have ever set up a new customer event. So that's going to be me waiting for the order transaction result page to hit. And then I'm going to do a look up in the blue. I'm going to say, is this a new customer or not? If yes, then fire this custom JavaScript and call it new customer. Like event is new underscore customer.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, what purpose like just to know that this transaction was from somebody that you've never had before or like to what end is what I'm getting at.
00:14:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so then. in GA4 I can say, show me new customer sources. I say, your new customers come from Google organic.
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got you. Got you got you. Also, like, you know, then it would be like, you got this many new customers along the stuff that we already know, but it would be in that place too. And then, if I can do that look up and fire it into GA4, then I could also say, and go apply this tag in the infusion talk.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We used to work around with that with Infusionsoft and onto port with what we call the sandwich page. That was sandwiched between checkout and the thank you page, the landing page that the customer got to once they purchased. in the checkout page settings, you can always say, okay, where do they go after completion of checkout? so it would go to a sandwich page and all that was on there. was a pixel, a tracking pixel, and a redirect, a meta redirect, so that it happened, you know, within seconds. And so the customer never saw it because it's a blank white page, and it just looked like a page was loading. But that fired the pixel, and then it would go to their landing page, and it happened so quick that, you know, nobody was upset or bothered by it, but then it allowed us to get a fire, a pixel fired that wasn't built into any of the systems.
00:16:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, similar principle, except just JavaScript faster. Yeah, well, and you can do more, right, so I can like delay, I could send the event in the data layer after the fact, I can send it with everything else.
00:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that appending data is amazing. And I only seen that though, what JavaScript and jQuery.
00:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, same principle.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.
00:18:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's thing is like you can't, you can't measure what you don't know, right? It's like, I'm figuring out like, oh, yeah, want to measure. And then his custom JavaScript, so mine's like even more custom. And I can't, there's this, there's this idea that you can, you can take something like that and you can put it in as something else I can't remember the name of. But he's like, it's very rare that people use this, and I'm like, I have a feeling that's exactly what I'm going to need. And then his custom JavaScript is to do other things, like maybe you're combining events or you're defining your own where they scroll and stop plus 40 seconds. Like, I think you have to create a timer which JavaScript it does the 40 seconds. And they're like, okay, now fire it. So I'm getting into his stuff. But I think there's, and then I think once I go through his stuff, then, of course, that's going to make me go, Oh, I could do this, this and this too. Yeah, Lucy's, Lucy's working on the Lucy set up the creator user on form. It's working. We're making sure that doesn't break anything. He said, doesn't break anything. been live for like two days. Nothing's broken, but I know I haven't seen anything bad. And now I have to take the next step there is for me to get him to to insert custom meta on like I got to define the meta and then send it to them and say okay great create this meta so when they submit the form and you create the user also attach this meta magnet notes source whatever the source is in PGT I just have to look for and see like it'll probably like source not medium maybe campaign or keyword probably keyword oh and then Norio's gonna have to like I didn't know this but they've added utms so there's some new utms and then there's these new utms that have been added and then there's these other utms that are usable but not officially added that you know just allow you to and more data so Norio would have to like expand our plugin to include those, but we don't need them right now.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, one tab, there we go. yeah, so how's Noriel's stuff with high level and fan flow going?
00:21:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so he and I went around and around and there was some, so he has to sort of learn it, right, and then, but he gets to learn it, Ruby going, oh no, no, no. Go here, look at this, it does this, so he sort of gets short cut, only thing is to wait. Well, he doesn't really have to wait, right? By the time his email hits me his day is over and then when he wakes up the next day, he's got his answer provided I responded, and then lately he's been staying, he's screwed up later in the day, he was emailing me yesterday or he's working later because he was emailing me like definitely after her day was over but I think I got um everything he needs to get his first app working and then the the mod side or whatever the JD photos was named in their company the JD photos guy we we hooked up with them because they had the custom value updater that's how I found them so I paid 250 bucks to get access to their it's like lifetime access to their custom value updater but we keep running into it not working like intermittently and we don't really know it didn't work until somebody notices something's wrong kind of thing or something breaks essentially and then we'll trace it back and be like oh the values didn't get updated so those guys don't know when it breaks clearly we don't I don't know when it breaks, and then we hit them up and say, hey, this isn't working. So on the call of Monday, I'm like, man, this, when I was already thinking this, this doesn't work long-term. Long-term we need our own custom value updater, and we need one that would check, did the update occur? No, then run it again, or did the update, and if you can't, then it would send a message and say, custom values did not update something, something that would let someone know it's wrong. Ultimately, it would just not, it would just work or self-correct. So I hit up Norion, I was like, hey, I'm going to see if these guys will sell me their code. What do you need? And he's like, oh, you know, I need a walk-through or docs, and just that explains how it works, and he has seen some, he's seen the code that they write, and he's like, dude, their code's terrible. It's like it works, but it's not good. I'm like, not our concern at the moment, Norion. focus on the first part.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he like used some of their code to write his app. And so he's like, yeah, we can we can do that. I hit up those guys and told I explained to him, hey, look, listen, breaks. We don't know when it breaks. Ultimately, we need to own our own version, and I buy a copy of your code. And then we'll move it to our server and, you know, do that. Like, I was like, let me ask the developers. And then he came back, he's like, yeah, sure, we can sell a few 700 bucks.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Done. What?
00:24:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Stacy literally just sent them 700 bucks. And, uh, Nario just, I told Nario needs a loom. And, and then he's already worked with them to move code around. So they'll get it sent up on the server. And then Nario will tell me, I'll tell him what's wrong with it after the fact. We don't know when it doesn't work. So I'm sure he'll be like, that's easy.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, typical, or real fashion. Um, okay. Hold on a second. Seriously, click over there. So like, what is the, I have to go back and look at my notes from last week. Hold on a second. Was all this week? No. Yeah. I don't have like, what are the targets for what Noreo is doing?
00:25:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Meaning.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what do you, he's working on building fan flowy, right?
00:25:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's finishing the wedding, the, the wedding time. Yeah, but that's still, that's Abishik keeps finding like bugs and whatever. So there's, it's like true bugs and Noreo's fixing those and then there's nice to house or what if it. And the what if it did nice to haves are being Saved but not worked on so nor is just fixing the bugs and He got another round of those literally on Monday right right up to the meeting So he's like I'm not sure what I'm gonna be done. It's weeks, but he's like provide it He's like I thought Abhishek was done, but I literally just got an email with like five more So but he had talked to Abhishek about hey just yes, I want to hear it all and separate them like this And so they're doing that He's like man. He is good at finding this stuff and he really is So that will probably be done I would say by the end of September and Then Eric is talking to Norio about What to confirm is what we tell you about the summer day So we have the free wedding seating planner for epitome and then I bought the way of that So that's basically just a lead gen site and it's fill out this form and get access to our free win and seeding planner The idea being we generate leads they tell us engage pop up by Budget all the good stuff and then we give them access we limited access to Perfect wedding timeline just the seeding planner portion So Eric's needs to talk to Noria about okay, how do we do how are we doing that? It's gonna be a gravity form to what a webhook an API What and then once that function is worked out Greg's already done the design and then we'll just do like a super simple I mean problem. I mean I say a one-page site might legitimately mean it like there might be some Content pages that we do in the background that are for SEO, but like they're not in the nav Right, there's there's nothing for sale on that site It's just straight up you want to pre-winning seating planner popped in.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I like that. And what is, do you have like a target date for that?
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we can't use it until the software is done. So we're going to try to, once we know the connection, then, I mean, I might look at like, it's like, what is a good, I'm sure there's one, I'm sure there's one from back in the day, where it's like just a pure lead gen site. Like to me, it's just like, that you're free-winning, like, and every email. And then of course, it'll just expose the other fields. So I might just look for like, what's the best opt-in site ever? Great, someone had like a free SDO analyzer, like back in the day, like crushed.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things just didn't.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be something like that. I'm going to go find something like them and just do that. Fine. I mean, that will take Craig. 20 minutes, and it'll take like, and I'm still at the thing where I'm like, I don't want to build sites until this stupid thing is done. So there's also that. I'm interested to see like how far they get. I think they meet with Frank every, I think it's every week.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now they just back on top of vacation.
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Oh, I have the notes about high level is raising third party integrations, but I just kind of left that hanging and I don't know. remember talking about it, but I don't remember.
00:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
scenario to review but it's not like unlocked yet you can't even what they do is they they release stuff in the lab so it's going to be in the lab I want to say like yeah I want to say it's like three weeks but there was some doc there was some documentation on it when I sent you to Norio okay and on Monday he's like all review it and like you know like sort of was like this is what I'm thinking like that it's going to be like another level of being able to integrate with it and I mean that's exactly what it sounded like so it's like beyond APIs I'm like I don't know what that really means that'd be interesting yeah I think it's that you can get access to like user ID and stuff that you can't get access to be just the API so we'll see um let's hold on a second
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, so the conversation about basically having the kind of menu items and what the team can provide when people request custom work or, you know, like what's the scope of support basically for basis customers, Bobbi was getting back at that and making sure that everybody's on the same page with that.
00:31:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where is that at right now? I don't know. Did I not go to meeting on Monday? I missed it.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, it had to be over within nine minutes because I went there. was like, holy crap, I snoozed the alarm one too many times because I was making lunch. I was like, oh, it's like night after. And then I dial in and there's nothing.
00:31:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We definitely didn't talk about it.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Need to talk about it?
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't talk about it. mean, I know he was working on, but I don't know. don't know that I'll see if it should be a task somewhere. I don't ever go into work.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to knows of. If she doesn't know of it, then it's probably not passed out, but we'll see. Just to make sure that it's getting traction. Oh, Brunchy, no more issues, only reset you with the last thing.
00:33:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we figured out the fact that if user logged in and creates an API, it's only visible to that user. It's not visible to anybody that has admin access to the account. So Heather had logged in and created an API key at one point. Ross had logged into their account, Ross had landed, logged in and created an API key at one point. I wish I could be J had logged into range. And then they were something, whatever, one of the sites and they'd created an API key. So then when Eric or whoever was going in and changing the API key and I'm replacing it on the site, there was always another API key that that person couldn't see. One way or the other. So there was Eric, he didn't see Abishik. He didn't see Abishik, he didn't see Eric, so it was Heather. She didn't see Eric, so there was Eric, he didn't see Heathers. So in essence, it was always an API key available. So when the one, you know, Heather and Ross and those guys, they're not working on the site. So what was happening was Eric would change the API key and whooper and it would still happen. We're like, how is this happening? We never understood how it was happening. It was because there was an exposed API, there was a compromised API key that was there that nobody essentially knew about. So now they've all been deleted. And then Only we are creating API keys and those like do not create API key and it's definitely quelled it almost completely but Wolfers We're trying to get them moved over to stripe and then brain tree still giving us a bunch of Like we're like we're not even using you guys anymore and they won't the account Because they're like your account is still at risk. We're not using it So it's not at risk and they're like you need to put capture on your checkout will unlock the account That was this morning like oh my god really So soon as that one gets out of risk they'll unlock the account and then proceed with the migration step but they have not done that yet and I think with Think with Reset you there were so few that they just manually migrated them or they're going into, but in the brain news off. So the other two are underway. They will hopefully be off within a week or less. And then we're done with brain tree.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was the most outcome. how is another 71 doing just any updates since last week?
00:36:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually the week part is the same at the weird part is. It's the same average of last year where last year we thought we're going to increase sales because they're changing the exam, right? Which now seems like maybe wasn't totally true. Maybe it was just, I mean, again, we don't have enough data, right? Because if you go back three years, you're in this COVID world. So we're like point, like point one off. So like, let's say last year we were averaging 30, 33 point or 34 sales a day or something. Right now, we're like 33.9, oh my God, so it's like nearly identical. And then that persisted through, well, that went well into December with this gigantic spike right before the exam was removed. So we don't know. We don't know what's gonna happen. We're just keeping on, keeping on. It's still just going to come down to where the new customers come from, especially where the new customers come from in 2025, or at least from May of this year forward where things sort of return to normal, but then more so in like, okay, this is normal. We're in a normal year. Where do these people come from? It's still going to come down to that. Even if we're just back on track or back, we're at this pace of like the best pace ever. I think we're up to like almost 4300 subscribers. It's still going to be like in order to grow this.
00:38:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to know where your customers come from. Right.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's... We bought CMA exams.com, like a week, a week ago, two weeks ago. So I just was texting Bobby about that, so we're building that site. So now we'll have CPA exam.com, CMA exam.com, there isn't an equivalent for CPE, but we started getting some CPE sales, our renads for those, we started getting sales, but I'm not sure they're coming from there yet, but that'll be the thing, it's like, okay, once I can get all this tracking lined up and locked in, then we're gonna know. Oh, and the other, and then we figured out, I never thought about this before, so we started ranking for ethics exam, so the ethics exam is this exam that they have to take after they've passed all four sections, so it's like literally your final step before you get licensed, so we had ethics exam pages on CPA exam.com and then I noticed, I think it's like an off-sh of the other SEO that maybe those started ranking better, and then we've gotten an uptick in leads there, and then I was like, wait a minute, we could rank for all 50 states for those, and essentially you're gonna get a bunch of people that pass the exam with who knows who, I don't care. I don't care what you bought at this point, but I do know that you're gonna need CPE in the near future once you get your license, so that we have an ethics exam guide for all the states. So like, if we start SEOing that, then start pitching those people into CPE, that could probably work out. So Gert and those guys, we gave them, we bought like 25 SEO pages of them. We're like, hey, can we take four of those and do these four ethics exam pages, we just picked the top. Like, I know, I think we've picked Delaware for some reason. Oh, because it was the most representative what the content should look like. So we actually took one page, sent it to them. They're going to optimize that one. And then we're going to say, great, not going to these four based on the template you just came up with. So then they'll do California, Florida, Texas, New York.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, that just seems kind of like this similar type of stuff that we've been doing with Mark, which is leveraging more, don't know, sources, not necessary sources, but entry points. Yep, it is too. Yeah, the market increase and that those analytics like that systematic, detailed, accurate level, analytic stuff that you're working on and building is who else is doing that? else is doing that. Like I feel like you're going to exceed your goals quickly. I don't know what quickly is. can't quantify that, but I think that the pace will be like when you get there be like, damn, I don't like, look what happened.
00:42:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's all like, you know, whether you sell it or not, you, you know, just make more money.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were talking about getting back to your breathing stuff.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did something else, but I did it on Mondays. What'd you do? Yeah. got it. It was this other sort of guided thing because I was at home. So I like, I can't really. was at home and I had the dogs when I can't really check out for an hour. So I was like, I could probably check out here in the hammock for 20 minutes. Mm-hmm, and it worked whatever was I forgot about it was one I'd never done But I was like, oh it was it was one that was like It's like a meditation to get in touch with your spiritual guide. I was like, I'll try that I found an audible weirdly enough Interesting I want to my thought about me either I've got like a gazillion audible credits lined up.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I proceeded to buy like five books Okay Snaps, Snaps I I'm scrolling back to obvious eight and it says that your peak in the past was 4,000 60 active subscribers and did you just tell me today?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at your 4300? Oh, no, the 4,060 is the proverbial glass ceiling.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that year passed?
00:44:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, but I realized you can pass it, right, during your peak season. So my guess is, let's say, so yeah, we're passing. So let's say we, I think we hit that early July mid mid-July. I think we hit a mid-July. So from that day forward, my guess is if I take that number and the number on January 1st, the average will be 4060. It can't really be more than that because the math dictates. But can you exceed it right now? but then I also know in December, we will get three or four hundred cancellations. So let's say we get up to 44. for 100, which we may or may not, but whatever it is, we know there's going to be a mass exodus in December. And then if you were to average it out, your average is probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060. And Bobbi's like, we're past it. And I was like, yeah, that's true. But there's some missing something. And then I thought, oh, wait, yeah, of course you can exceed it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But averages are basically not that. Well, that's going to be fun to see and interesting. It'll be funny, even if it's true, because the numbers, well, yeah.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the only thing that will change it is if the 33 remain, right? That's based on it being 31 average as well, right? So if the average is stays at 33, which we won't know until November, then you can exceed the 4060. Then it would be whatever I'd have to rerun the math and be like, okay, now it's 40 109 or whatever that
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is 33 being new, um, customers, right a day, uh, subscriptions, new subscription, not new customers, customer, the customers is a 21 or whatever we've always been using 21 and 31.
00:46:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Those, those are the ones that got us.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. met Melody was getting some pushback from Melody and she wanted to build it a certain way. I'm like, no, no, no. And then she's like, we need to talk about this. I attended the call and she explained it. And then when she was done talking, she was all like, this is it. I just said, wrong. It's like, that's to be rude. Wrong. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we don't like this. And then I explained it to her and her and the other guy were like, yeah, we could do it that way. And then we all get what we want. Your way, I lose a lot. You gain a lot. And I lose a lot. This way we both don't lose. You gain what you want to gain. I gain what I want to gain. And it's all better off. So then they're like, then now they're going about building that, which is essentially it involved like re-architecting the tags. It's like a slight re-architecture. But but because it's across like six products and yadda yadda. and we had to remove a bunch of tags, they're like, all right, we're gonna go build it out and then, I'm right, I mean, I know I'm right, because I thought about it, I'm like, I'm right, this will work, and it will resolve a bunch of issues, so they're in the process of doing that re-architecture and creating the missing tags, and then writing down, okay, we're gonna get rid of these tags, and this is how we're gonna get rid of them, and then they hooked up, they hooked up a plugin yesterday that helps them, they're very concerned about like, people losing access when they have two subscriptions, which really isn't that big a deal, but even that will be resolved, and then part of the plan would also be to eliminate the infused Woo plugin, which their convinced is somehow causing some of these issues, which may or may not be true, and I was Like, that's fine, because I took portions of that away from that. I took portions of the functionality away and put it in Zapier, and it's worked fine, but we could use make, like, either or, um, so the plan is for them to get it all mapped out, built, essentially, and then, then we're going to figure out when we can launch it. And we're basically at, like, the price is going to be, like, 77 and 87, think. Jeff didn't want to do the 77. I'm like, we have to, because if nothing happens, we've done this for nothing.
00:52:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remind me with the 77 and 87 are.
00:52:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do have that, but I didn't do it good that 77 a supplement 87 is full course, right? Okay. And we just had someone, this was online. like last week someone went on a Reddit and they started this thread and it was like do not buy me just cpa review it to rip off and it the guy was complaining that he was complaining about he was complaining that that didn't refund them or something it was like super super ready and then like a mild pile on started with this other guy that came in and then all these other people started commenting and it was just it's just so sad that it's so clear they think it's a supplement they think it's a supplement and then they also questioned the sixty seven dollars i'm like oh my god and then our people showed up the ninjas showed up and they're like what are you talking about like do the math If you buy a Becker for 3,000 if you buy a ninja and you take each second up to the three months at a time time 67 you're only spent you're spending less than a thousand dollars, and then they're like just the best I've never had a problem with him. He's the only person he's been in this industry forever He's the only person that comes right just the deluge of defenders and then I guess the mods came in They weren't around and they're like yeah, we're deleting this whole thing This is this person just joined reddit and their first thing is to to track and slag on one of the best cpa review courses There is delete they deleted the whole thing.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get the screens?
00:54:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's first no like I Was like it I was like on my phone To get well we have tons of those there's tons of those on on reddit So I do want to start using them on the new sales page because I think they're more powerful than yes You know testimonial block We have great ones. We have whole threads that just wave about us.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you for sure should be using them in your marketing.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. We have one that's literally called is Ninjacy. And this is like someone asking a question for real. Is Ninjacy Pay Review a scam? Like I couldn't have paid to have someone do that. We use it in our emails. In case you're wondering if Ninjacy Pay reviews a scam, go here. And it's all these people raving about it. We have this one dude on Reddit that's like are one of our biggest defenders. He's like, I passed all four sections using Ninja whenever, but his screen name is Nutella Nick. Oh, I know. I'm like, oh, buddy, it's hard to recognize you in marketing. Only because it's a trademark term, not no other reason.
00:55:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. But he showed up. He showed up and like went off like, this is .
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but couldn't you use it and then just like black out parts of the username like and you.
00:56:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, we don't even need to use this. No, there's tons of them. But I want to use those instead of the, I mean, we created these testimonial blocks. But I'm like, and we have like the Reddit logo. I'm man, we should be using just straight screen caps of those. And then, and then them in those locations, rather than us cutting pasting the actual thing and linking to it. Like we'll cut and paste and then link to the actual thing. But no one's probably clicking through. mean, that's something I can look at. But I doubt people are clicking through. Whereas they, if they see it's from Reddit, just from the, like literally like a better and then videos. It's like, okay, those are probably your two. best but i can split test this video testimonials yeah we use those those totally work i was just about to ask you about them because i think that like we have tons do you have a social media account or you just share that stuff regularly uh we i run them as ads on facebook this one this girl made is so good oh like oh my god you couldn't it's like it's like she made it on purpose but he didn't right and she sent it to us and we turned into an ad where do you stockpile your testimonials the video ones are in this service called boast and then the text ones we don't even gather anymore we just have so many it's ridiculous yeah but you should keep them current uh i mean they're not I don't think the date. I don't think we put dates on the testimonials. Um, any of them, really.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I don't even think we gather.
00:58:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, we gather them on the cancel. So they do, they do updates. I just haven't used a new one recently. Sometimes I'll you, I'll check out the video ones and maybe I'll swap in the video one here and there. Uh, but I try to let, you know, I'm trying to get someone that's like, they use Becker. They, they're a ninja only, right? I can only use like so many. Like I was with Becker and then this, right? So it's like, okay. and then I ran some of his ads and like you see which ones did good as ads, then I put them on the landing page and then I ran a test on the landing page at which one do people watch the most and I made that one first. Did you like that?
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish that we got to do another 71 completely separately because I I would so love to drive growth there, that would pay, would love to drop growth there too, hopefully I'll be able to do that as soon as the stupid tracking is worked out because I don't know how to drive growth there. I have so many ideas and there's stuff that you touch but not systematically. But once you get that set up, we'd be able to track everything. But it needs to be set up because I literally just been throwing stuff at the wall for years.
00:59:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still convinced I could turn off all the ads and nothing would happen. Or it would happen but it would take six months. I'm like, I don't want to find out that way.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Gosh, it's crazy just thinking about, first of all, it was seven years ago, and then you're like, I don't do email. I'm like, it doesn't work. I know, I know, look at that. And then maybe you might still be right. But regardless, the thing is, we've watched, we've learned it together with Mark is that there is a, you know, having multiple, so for him, it's vendors. For you, I think it would be channels, ad channels. Oh, yeah, like a formal approach and multiple tactics to what you're applying on those channels that don't in and of themselves make huge differences. But the compounding effect are like, first of all, anytime things dip, you don't really dip, you don't even feel it because everything else just kind of buoyed it up. But yeah, but the analytics portion of it is to be able to have very clear, reliable data is huge. And just
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
all the things that you've learned over the years anyway adding adding into that anyway that's awesome holy crap how's it 105 i could just whatever toy flies okay wait so meditations we're good you're taking care of you sound good found the good you've only just got her moving date so we gotta go visit the campus and then she moves in on his two day 2021 20 is a Friday i'm like probably moving in on the 21st that's a temper yeah she got her dorm assignment she's gonna have two roommates and a expert large triple and everything i mean it's the oh she told me the name of the building it's like an author's last name no i think it's a hog So I think can tag another, I don't think that is another, so the HAG haul, I guess, and I don't know what the hell is up with college right now, but you want to talk about a light schedule. I was like, you're kidding. That's it.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like four classes, period. What? That's it. That's it. And they're on the quarter system. So it's 10 weeks. And we have four classes, 10 weeks, and then 10 weeks. I don't know if some of them carry over, they're two quarter classes or whatever, but she's like maxed out on credits, which is like, I literally can't take anymore. She's like one credit guy, I'm like the total max, and that's four classes or something. And then her earliest classes at eight and her latest classes at eight p.m.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But also also.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a wide.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
breath yeah so what's she taking on that like what's her major bio no biology microbiology okay how far away is she doing the school yeah it's eight hours drive uh it's an hour of life hour now how is Denise doing i'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking able and leaving really yes yeah you don't need the care i'm like for though i just look at it as part of life i mean it's what happens unfortunately things move forward where we march on it's going to be interesting how mario handles not having a sister around even if they don't get along you what she's already acting weird yeah it's it's hard i don't know if it's related, but it's like, I think it might be.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're they're talking, they've been talking more than ever the last like two months.
01:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like amongst themselves or whatever. And she's definitely over the I hate Evelyn face. I wasn't that long, but it would be had for a while. Yeah. then, yeah, so it'll be interesting see how her and Denise react.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you revolve car, you need the ocean, and you need to figure out how to keep those two happy, because this is going to be very hard for them.
01:04:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I, whereas I was like, you know, she apparently, so Jenny DeRoz went to the school to UC Santa Cruz. And I don't know what I said to her, but she's like, Oh, yeah, no, like, you're only guaranteed housing your first semester. And then the second semester, it's like hit or miss, or your first year, you have to live on campus for year, you can't have a car. And then your second year, you can apply to live on campus. But it like hit her mess. She's like, it's like, she said when she was gone, there was like a borderline crisis to get housing. And then everyone's like, no, it's still like that. Like everyone's saying like getting housing the second year. So then you have to get off campus. And Jenny's like, when we went to go off campus, she's like, I literally, you need a dossier on yourself to get the gut housing. And then we go apply for it. 50 people are applying. And then it's like hit her mess. And of course, my takeaway is like, oh, I should buy two bedroom condo and Santa Cruz, little mirroring.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that play.
01:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, that's the entrepreneurial take is property. Right. I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pay rent or, or boarding to the school, why wouldn't I just pay to myself? Right.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm paying it either way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. like, I should go to, so a two bedroom condo. 800 grand, so I'm like, hmm, let's see how this election pans. I got about a year. like, can hit the fan between it's gonna hit the fan soon. What? they just revive, you see that the labor, the jobs, number revision that they just did, they're like, oops, turns out we were over by 800,000. You're kidding. Really? So that, until that, so that was like two, three days ago, leading up to that, and still even yesterday, people were talking about, oh, bed's gonna lower the rates. Well, part of the way they do that is they're using employment or rather unemployment as like a leading indicator. So it's like, they're like, unemployment's good, so you can lower the rates, is sort of already. And it's like, hmm, but if that number It was run by 800,000. Isn't this other number wrong? Like, isn't this leading indicator fake balls incorrect? Well, it's like, yes, but if they so they lower the rates, I mean, it sort of where this if you I was someone would show these charts, like the parallel between what's happening right now and like the two right before the 2008 crash is like very similar. A lot of the indicators look the same. So it's like, why wouldn't it go that way? And then lowering the rate. People are like, you know, a lot of financial people are like, you can't lower these rates. Like, you can't do that. You could trigger a much worse outcome. Ron doesn't say the whole time. There's no way this ranks. She's like, there's no way. There's no way that they keep saying soft landing. She's like, I don't see it. I don't see how it's possible. You have to pull a rabbit out of a hat. She's like, I don't believe it. I don't believe this is real and I would come in due time, like it's either it's going to happen, and then that would be like this quarter, right? They do. They only meet once a quarter. That meeting's probably in the next couple weeks. So they're either going to do it or they're not. And then the markets will react based on that. And we'll see. And then God only knows what happens with this election.
01:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want this. I don't want either one of them. But here's the thing about Trump is like, we know who he represents him. He represents who he is, what he is. We know his pattern. We know his MO because he's a steady douchebag. But like what his strengths are, we have some definitely definite economical power, There's there's some good.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's disgusting.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's right. Kamala is a puppet. Like she we don't I don't even know who she represents. I don't know what she represents. Somebody's behind her, now no idea who it is. I don't know what their MO is. I don't know anything about that. so she is a wild card that puts us at huge risk. And we have no idea. But why I think she'll win, which I don't want, but why I think she'll win, is because I think she will bring out the female and black voters just because she's woman and black, and that between the two of them, that's a population that has been largely just like, if everybody, I don't really care. I think a lot of females that never voted well now. And same with black people. And I think, and especially looking at the stats right now, how amazing she's doing, which is, again, terrifying. She's stupid. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't stand for anything. And I don't know who's behind her. That's the most, yeah. So like in terms of like business and needing to create as much. Like I want to get to being able to rent my house out, buy another one, like have some property investments as soon as possible. There's no solid guaranteed investment, but the one thing about like in my church, we do food stores. I'm like, I'm gonna have property stores. If I meet family to live, you know, it can either make me money or it can house my people, but one way or the other, like that's where I want to start with it. Like yeah, kids. So okay, let me get back to your Denise Rowland for a second and the girls eight hours away, holy crap, you should buy the property. She is gonna hit the fan. I'm so glad that you're doing the work of the analytics right now because that foundation, like as she hits the fan, there are, and this is why I teach what I teach, it's fundamentals, right? There are certain types of things, clean, accurate data so that you Because a lot of people are going to be trying to guess and figure out what to do, and you're going to have the ability to know what to do, plus all the things that you've already built, the systems, the teams, the reputation, having had a very smart offer for a while now, especially with it being the subscription model that you already paid the price for, all the dip and finances. There's so many things that you've been doing, and we knew that the recession was coming. It took longer than most people, most of the analysts, most of the VCs thought it was going to take because they pumped money in, but we knew it was going to happen. And it gave you enough time to do such a good work, but I don't like, I mean, you might feel a dip, but it's not going to hurt you at all.
01:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Why don't you think that will be a dip because in 2008, I went and looked at this at one point. randomly because of David in 2008 when that uncertainty enters right it's not going to help it helps his business because people are like I need to get a new job right I need to they also retreat to education so they go my domain and yours so they retreat to education and there was like a we got a bump a noticeable bump back then and we didn't have our own product so it was like oh that's interesting and you could see I look up here I think I looked at search day I looked at a bunch of stuff I was like oh that's interesting plus we the if a pandemic didn't take us out pretty sure research is not like it was like they shut
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
down the entire business and it was like and we made it yeah that's it's crazy but it's awesome also if i can just get through whatever the it's just the having taken care of everybody so long getting myself so far in debt trying to do that when i get this going and all the data that i have with it like i don't worry about anything also because of the investing that i'll do but like there's so many there's so much volatility for so many people which is why i'm helping three other families but it's it's scary for other people and then i'm going to see so many people i care about just struggling because they're already struggling because things are so expensive but it's also amazing to me what being strategic and consistent can do for people yeah yeah anyway all right well good job I'm so glad you're doing the GA4 stuff. I cannot state that enough. It is so important.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, good job.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really make some good plans for Mario and Denise and Evelyn too, although she's probably going to be having fun, but then she's also going to get very homesick and that you're going to be in the middle of all of that. Good luck.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do think it's great. Here's the silver lining. If you time it rightly, that's a word.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It actually is a word. That's the right way. You can like a flight to San Jose is like 60 bucks. So I was looking at that in my company. That's what we doable. So you could go visit her at the drop of a hat and it's not going to, right? Like 45 minute drive. Easy peasy. Like you could do that in the day anytime. Anytime you wanted, um, which was not the case for my parents playing from Boston to DC there in the sixty nine dollars life Made major of airports. You could just show Denise all the things that are on the table because she still doesn't really get like what you're Doing this. Yeah, we're gonna go. We're gonna go visit now because now we can go visit I was hoping it would play out like this. I go. Okay, great. I can buy a flight for like next Wednesday We fly up in there in the morning running a car driving the campus ago. This is your dorm This is where your first class is.
01:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this.
01:15:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is that We're looking at like theirs target. Okay, great because we're gonna be here in two weeks doing this. Yeah, we're three weeks doing this again.
01:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, good. They're gonna do good, but keep using that brain of yours for Building your family because this transition period sucks. It's hard But it's better when you're when you when you do the planning and when you do all this stuff. they're just going to need you. That's all I'm telling you. They're going to need your even killed and an entrepreneur. We solve these things.
01:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that bothers you. Let's fix that. Goodness. No parking. We're at the office. He's like, something's here.
01:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You took her to the office.
01:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Someone was supposed to be here. I mean, Eric and Stacy, and then I was like, can't be at home. Someone else was supposed to come out of office, who I think just, if it's them, I'm going to be surprised that you knew it was somebody else. Because Eric and Stacy, walking around the whole time, you haven't made a sound. I guess this is the other person's here.
01:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have, Zinni or Bell? Bells. All right, so I will let you go figure out who that is and I will talk to you Monday.

Hi.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:00:02 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How are you? I had to feed the animals. The animals. Yes. Oh, my God. My nephew was so amazing. He went back to Guelph, which is about two hours away. He just got back from two months in Europe. He graduated, and he took a year off before applying for a master's program. But he's going to do his little side business cleaning people's eaves troughs. And he was so cute because last night he was asking me all these questions so we can rank on page one of Google. So I was given everything to do. They said, I'm going to clean your e-shirts. Well, I'll pay you. You said you're going to charge $150 per house. No, you gave me so much free information. I'll do for free. So he came over dinner for free. I took all these pictures and videos of them so you can use Google Business listing. And then when I left and I came back, he had also filled up five bags of leaves because we have lot of leaves from the fall. So I sent him a hundred bucks. Aww.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a good kid.
00:00:58 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's a good kid. Yeah. How are you feeling? you've had lot of meetings and you were gonna grab something to eat before our call.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I grab something to eat. feel like I have something and my teeth is driving me nuts but I'm good. My kidney hurts a little bit but I have kidney pain a lot so deal with it and that also goes with diabetes so um and I've always had hypoglycemia and had issues so that makes sense but you're going frustrating and moving on.
00:01:30 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well um it's Halloween night are you giving up candy?
00:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't really clap. I live on a hill so I can just eat the whole city which is wonderful but you don't really like climbing up there so.
00:01:43 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh no it's good. If the drug oil rains here it's because I have to go give out some Halloween candies so it's like all right.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah you're later than me.
00:01:50 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well it's 4.36 it's not bad but it's supposed to rain tonight so if I were a parent I'd probably take my kids out earlier than 11 later so we'll see now.
00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You ready to get into this?
00:02:01 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me screen share. I want to go floss my teeth by now is what I want to do.
00:02:10 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you okay? can come back if you want.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I might take you up on that in a minute, but let's see. All right. So we were talking, I'm getting my bringing together. Um, first we were formulating the rocks for the. Yep. I'm not going to call it Q4, but really, to me, it goes into the first two to three weeks of January. Um, because trying to end things just at the new year, like the last two weeks are not, yeah, and really productive at all. Yeah, by middle of December, then it's going through my January, especially when you're talking about offers. Oh, I'm just review this. I didn't get or anything, know, that's what I think it made me one. Okay, so this is just going to be the one thing I didn't put in here is that this we will be organic organic. If it comes, it comes Q1 of 2025, we can consider actively marketing. I'm going to move this to the top because really actually, you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all of this and make this Q1 block, a Q1 rocks. Can I say this? I don't want to call this. And then add a card. here one in there. I just want to edit it. Oh, one card. There we come. Okay, we'll set that. And we're going to move this up here. Meeting agenda. That's not what I want to do. So I want to. I don't know how to do this. It's just is this card. would just want a new board.
00:05:07 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would be on the left hand side where it says boards and I see it says your boards and it's a plus sign.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:14 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We prepared our boards of this.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We'll see. This whole thing is considered a board because that's a workspace and this is a board and this is a list. It's not a, it's not a board that I need.
00:05:30 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a list. Oh, okay.
00:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, no, that's not right.
00:05:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what I can say, um, get rid of the menu on the left, hit X.
00:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on a second, because I've got the, um, not the right, sorry on the right, hit X. Yeah, which I don't even see because of zoom and got it.
00:05:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think the new list will be behind there, like after your last list, you can probably hit a plus. So keep going. Yeah, to the right.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. It's you. The Atlas name. And so I'm going to call this quarterly rocks and I'm going this list right over here. Good job. Thank you so much. Quarterly rocks and I'm going go queue for rocks and okay. And so this, I'm just going to move it into here even though we've got the image, there were some comments that went into there. And so meeting agenda of the E Queen. So one, three, high level done free clients. We're not talking about that right now. That can go. Let's see, quarterly rocks. that's the list. And the to-do items. We think about how any of this part of part of what we're going to have to do is figuring out. how to structure things as we go, but you'll, it'll be beneficial because you'll see, you know, like how I'm thinking about it because you're here with me while we do it. We'll also, I broke my nail earlier and I have to fix it. popped off because my hormones are like, so normally my nails don't pop and come undone. So I have really good stuff, but when my hormones change, one of the indicators is they don't stay sealed. so they pop more often. So anyway, we've got all these different things that tell me my hormones are whacked. But it also takes a little bit longer because I have to figure that out, but it, while it takes longer on the front end, it makes everything go smoother once we, and we get traction faster.
00:07:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like this was something that, oh, okay, that's because it was business HQ. So I'm going to move that list to my business HQ. I don't really know where I want to put that because we have a few different things.
00:08:16 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is this what you do for a lot of your clients?
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just kind of set up something like this? Not anymore. Not for a very long time.
00:08:22 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't do ops for anybody anymore. Just consult. Right. Gotcha.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody has project managers. so we do that. But I don't have a project manager. We will do this for ourselves. But it also is a great. And most people don't. And they don't have anybody good at it.
00:08:44 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the ones that they have, I trained.
00:08:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It's good too. It's a sharpening. My soft kind of thing. But also. This kind of structure, people need it.
00:08:57 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So.-hmm.
00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. It's. Rained up it's getting all the ideas out and having a place to be and then it's being able to put things and I say taskify which is not really a word but put it into a task an actionable item but then when you see it you can look at it go there's a logical chronological way that something needs to happen and then you can also start to see dependencies well chronologically these could happen simultaneously except this is dependent upon this is dependent upon that and normally people aren't looking at things like that especially if that's not the way that brain works which most people don't yeah so if we can train them to do that even though we can't give them like I can't give you them my brain to be able to process the way that I do but the visualization kind of leads leads them through it and so they can start thinking. It's, there's a saying that it's not believing or seeing is believing, believing is seeing, it depends on who you're talking to, whether not they think one is the other one is about faith and one is about whatever. But seeing sometimes is understanding and knowing. And so anyway, the visualization is really powerful. So project resources, I don't even know what this is. So we've got a master plan. We'll update that anyway. For us. So let's do what's happening now. So in progress, you are a live masterclass for you to I mean, that's a long thing, but it really is super clear. Yep. Yeah. And I use the ampersand for that. All right. And it would help if I could type things correctly. So let's just talk about this here a little bit. Last class. Where are you hosting it?
00:11:31 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Zoom. Time. What date? This Saturday, 10 a.m. Two to three hours.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember. Second. Second. Easter time.
00:11:49 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. It typed in November 3rd. It doesn't.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Small minor. Okay. Okay.
00:11:55 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I shouldn't have any. 10 a.m.
00:11:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
10 a.m. Okay.
00:12:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and Eastern time.
00:12:03 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, you said three hours. Two to three hours, yeah. And then on core repeat of it live for the people that can't make Saturday and also because I'm sharpening my saw and learning more on this, getting feedback Wednesday at 12 noon. So that the day after election day. You know, as a Canadian, I totally forgot about the election. Yeah.
00:12:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a time to have it depending on the I think a lot of people could not hear less. So it's interesting. The world is very different right now. Like, I think a lot of people care and a lot of people don't. think a lot of business owners don't. They're like, the best thing that I can do is more my business. It might be even more of an incentive for them to like take control of their lives. who knows, I would not not do it because of that. So yeah, statistically Tuesdays and Thursdays still Tuesdays Thursdays and Sundays are the best days for they're the most downtime type of days. So for webinars, like Sundays at 6pm, people are in their emails and they're buying stuff and that's been true for years and then it was still true. It is still true.
00:13:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's why some people have a lot of their end of like sale Tuesday night because then they have Sunday and Monday Tuesday. But let me tell you my thinking here. I actually prefer not that many people show up live, right? Because I only wanted to sell like minimum 10, like a grand just to cover it. But it looks like I might make three grand because there's like two grand now already sold. So more people bought today. But my concept of this is just without writing it down, which is explained, and this is kind of how I do things with us while teach this right sharpen the saw like it forces me the deadline to get all the curriculum together the SOPs together the checklist templates, but the final version is and this is what I told them all the emails they will get one year, Compton to all the upgrades to this program. So when this becomes or if this becomes $1,000 or $500, whatever, they don't pay anything more. They get one year access and that I will be creating a members area. And these will really be a sort of one three hour long video. They'll be like more like 10 videos, 10 minutes each, you know. So really, this is going to become a more, you know, what you call it easily to digest? yeah, consume course plus. I'm buying time because
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we just had the meeting yesterday to determine what is the big rock we're up selling this to eventually and we'd agree to be more of the CM pocket CMOCO offer and then also I think it was also like a maybe a group watching thing maybe or is it more just the but anyway so when I know what the end result is then when I record videos and stuff I can indoctrinate them into that other offer right so here's what I think you should I think everybody should keep this in mind all the time if you're going to be in any kind of coaching I think you should have top middle bottom tiers and the and there's multiple reasons for that but I'm going to touch on them super fast sure top tier higher money higher effective hourly rate but also higher level energy coming back from your clients when you work with high level people they teach you as much as you teach them you learn from them it's also higher energy and just higher value so it kind it it financially energy basically and intellectually fuels everything else that you do, the high level tier, okay? But you can only do a little bit of it. It also takes a lot of you energetically and intellectually, okay? The mid-level tier is to me, so we're talking about the 10% that not going to do a lot, the 10%, they're going to succeed no matter what you do, and then there's that 80%. And this is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most that are most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing, and we're gauging that by the things that we've set out. to attract them as well as the things that we've set up to filter out those who don't match this particular group set really well. So but they also give a significant enough amount of money that they that we're earning from them and they help fuel you know our lives and what we're doing in our business but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching right so we're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest pool of it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping what we need to do to improve what we're doing. Then the lower tier is kind of our give back but it's also the most scalable it's the most hands-off so it doesn't cost a lot anybody that wants it can probably afford it. by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week, if they can't, you know, if they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of this, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does don't give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do. So, anyone coaching and teaching should have all of these tiers for all of the reasons that I just said, they need the center group for the feedback loop and to make the impact, because anybody who's coaching wants to make an impact. That is part of what made them go into it in the first place. The high level group is needed because of what I said, because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. Um, you also want to have high level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high level connection. So that's important. And then the lower level thing, again, is just the super scalable, um, low, low impact. And if it continues to do well, that's also a market signal saying that this market still exists. Um, it continues to deal with lot of impact. So a lot of touching on it and everything that you do feeds each other. So everything that you do to serve your high level clients should, should come down. So you create, um, the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points. Three levels of earning power three levels of energy, you know what I mean, um, so it can be That you have those three levels for YouTube, but I wouldn't do that because The to be a high level YouTube creator and coach almost really feels like you've got a high level in video production and Yeah, in their minds probably yeah, and that seems like a lot of work Because there's a lot of skill involved. We're talking about huge processing power Yeah, time suck. So having a top middle and lower class for YouTube itself does not seem like a great idea as YouTube as a channel inside of marketing inside of a marketing Operation business hybrid makes much more sense to me as you are such a generalist and I am as well even even in my systems operations that if we're going to have an and you can't the bandwidth required to do more than one high-middle low level type of offering as a coaching consultant would take too much more than I would be willing to give more than you would probably be willing to get so to me that is the offer it's business sustainable um business growth um profits however you want to call it through a marketing systems and operations right and obviously it needs a sexier name but but that's it and so hopefully that gives you some clarity does yeah yeah so yeah um one of the things I'm going to do is put in um to uh
00:22:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Upwork just like an example looking for someone who can like here's the here's the problem you go you go to Fiverr to hire someone to do video editing for you and Because everybody's mind thanks to Helix permosi is on shorts They're charging like twenty five dollars for every minute because I think you're gonna do a 60 second short, right? From the scripts like well, yeah, well, use Veed and or cap cut myself But that's the first thing I want to outsource and so there's no I'm gonna pay twenty five dollars times ten minutes Right, so I'm just gonna go to upwork and offer twenty five dollars per, know Five to twelve minute video promise. I'll give you like, you know one video a week But probably more right because maybe share that VA with my students.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got a girl you could try Oh, it's not amazing. She's good and she's trainable. She's very smart and she loves to learn she communicates. Well, I think she's from Pakistan.
00:23:02 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on a second. Yeah, I still want to post the thing when I work because that's part of the training, like how to hire a VA as well, you know, but yeah, yeah.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was a work. Hold on a second. All right. Messages. She does Canva too. See if I can get her profile for you. I don't want to be a profile. No. Copy and then chat. I'll put in chat for you to open up. Thank you. You can look my carpet. Oh, so I posted a job. I can always tell from a cover letter of somebody's and be good if they're going to be exceptionally good. I'm trying to see where her first thing. Yeah, so I was needing somebody to do some combining for me and I posted a job, let me see, actually I'll job post. I'll show you because I wanted to show you like how just my process with it. So data organization virtual system. View job posts. Looking to combine several Google Docs into a large document, these docs are transcripts and the time stamps and other speakers removed before adding to the master document. Some are already in Google Drive folder and some will need to be extracted from note taker as at least 100 recordings. It's a simple task but I'm looking for a quality. send who communicates well is prompt, ask questions and as needed and cares about the quality of work. There are options for added opportunities for more work if you're interested to communicate well and are reliable. If you're interested, please send a cover letter explaining what interests you and let me know why I should hire you. Also, let me know if you prefer short-term clients or long-term clients, your attention to details required in order to be considered. So when you hire these low-cost people, generally speaking, you're not going to get a very articulate response and they're definitely not going to tell you how to solve the problem. But if you did exactly right, honestly, this is her reply, I'd suggest using Google Docs find and replace for you to locate and remove time stamps. I did this with AI so I ended up not doing anything and she says I've used this approach before when working on a project where I managed several interview transcripts and it saved me a lot of manual work. extracting records from a recording from Father NoTaker, I can ensure that everything is downloaded and efficiently. See, into the Google Drive folder you've provided, here are some other virtual assistant jobs I've done. And then, I'm genuinely interested in this job because I enjoy working on Google Docs and I'm well organized. My previous experience and handling somewhat transcription tasks as well as my attention to detail, notice the Oxford comma makes me confident I'd be a great fit for this role.
00:26:21 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
always ask questions when necessary to ensure I'm meeting expectations. mean the Oxford comma?
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I guess that's not really the Oxford comma because that would be the list.
00:26:31 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, just never heard of it. I'm just curious what you mean by that?
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's writing. was in key writing classes and things like that. The way that she uses the commas are extremely, this is very good English writing. Gotcha, She just did incredibly well. then we followed up and had different stuff. I ended up not needing her for that. So I asked her what other skills you have. And she does Canva and videos. Let's see, she shared a Google Drive with me. And like I said, these are not amazing. But because of her video response, her video, her emails, think that she could do really great if she's just trained and given instructions. She's very smart so she could do well. Let me show you this. Do you feel overwhelmed and anxious when it comes to taxes? All those laws, regulations, credits, Okay. And she's definitely got some interesting clients.
00:27:53 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a big business hydroponic towers.
00:27:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I want to get into it too. We do. just giving a huge like so good music she shows good music I think she was probably provided all these video clips so anyway but she is I think I hired her at like eight dollars an hour what was the contract view contract yeah eight dollars an hour so she could get those videos within your budget is what I'm saying mm-hmm if you're interested in that yeah so yeah okay so thank you for that time too you're welcome um every really really good I don't know experience whatever that's not the word a good track record for hiring good people through work and long term. It lasts for like years and years when I placed them with clients.
00:29:06 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to say, shoot, I lost my turn thought. Oh, do you use that scribe? I remember that tool you're mentioned for me to use.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't, there's nothing I've wanted to do with it. But no, but I do think it'd be very cool to check out and try if we had. Well, like if you're going to break a process down, which is what you do a lot, you know what would be really good is like your video where you doodled. I think you had a few of them, I know you had at least one. I would put that through scribe and see what it does just to get an idea of what it can do. Yeah, I'll start breaking the process down.
00:29:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'll start playing around with it for sure.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what can I do to support you in this and making sure that this goes well? let you get this recorded. I think, and once we get some feedback on how that call goes, there will be a lot that you and I can break down and then put into tasks and really start building something around that. But before you get there, how can I support you?
00:30:26 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think probably once I get the, like I said, high level in my head how I'm going to teach it, maybe when I just get the high level curriculum kind of put together, which will be tomorrow. I'll just shoot it over to you and look, you don't have to reveal because it's not going to make or break Saturday, right? But if you get a chance to review it, I think next week, the support will be more my thought process to make this a killer product, the final product, is going to be like, there's a part of it that and actually it's not going to be able to to be done next week because I want to get feedback from them and do a survey and all that stuff, what the challenges are. But my nirvana is for one aspect of it, and if it goes into a low ticket funnel, this will be up to one or up cell two, and is like ability just to hand off the SLP's to VA to do some work for them, like whether it's the research method or whether it's the video editing method or this the upload to YouTube method because I don't feel, hold on, I need to make sure I understand for you to hand off to a VA or them to get instructions and them to hand it off to a VA. Yeah, this is for the higher end product, right? me give you a better example, context. One of my friends has the organic group method put into a little ticket funnel. His upsell one that converts for $97 like crazy is called the automated growth stack, where hey, I will give you all the SOP's you need to hand off to a VA to an or to build and manage your Facebook group, only $97. Yeah.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, and so it's a $1 one time, not a $97 subscription.
00:32:11 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Correct. Unless we make this, remember, we're still deciding whether to sell it by a on demand webinar funnel for like $197 or $297, or whether we put this all into a low ticket funnel with the traditional $7 thing order bump of so one upsell too. Yeah.
00:32:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that I'm just thinking about this, let's see what you get out of the training and get all the feedback that you can. would love to be there and watch.
00:32:54 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you're welcome to.
00:32:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Observe and support.
00:32:58 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know what the because they do have girls this weekend.
00:33:06 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know what's going on. But I'm repeating it on Wednesday, remember that. And remember, this is my warm audience. I could just prepare, prepare nothing and get on and get some and love me, you know.
00:33:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yes. was I going with that? Oh, yeah. So just seeing seeing seeing the feedback, seeing what gets excited. So you're going to do it on zoom. Zoom doesn't have analytics does it?
00:33:35 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where you can you can measure engagement or does it? Um, I don't know if it does, but it'll be too small of a pool, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To really look at that. don't. Yes, it'll be a little bit different. It's definitely something to look at in the future. And you could probably get a pretty good temperature by how people are commenting or asking questions.
00:33:56 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I. You know this to be like you're just as good at this. I've been doing webinars since 2006 So I I orchestrate the engagement to a lot, right?
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well what I what I'm trying to get at though Is that um what I'm thinking is that whatever we can do to you know make it a a product stack that has All leads Anything that we can do to make them self-liquidating leads, right? So and honestly if it's all coming from YouTube, then that's a moot point because they're free You just putting anything but to to be able to convert as many people as we can into buyers Um, but I think that there's a stop point here, which is just like because we already talked about it We don't want to get into long-term YouTube by itself You know one-on-one Poaching time slot with Maria or you can get into our business growth stuff or YouTube marketing is a conversation that we have Because marketing Is something that we talk about often and YouTube marketing is what we're really loving right now So the only upsell beyond whatever this package is there is no Monthly subscription unless you join the the business growth one But really do you not need it because are you not trying to grow your business? Are you not trying to do it smart? you not trying to do it leverage? Are you not trying to do it optimize and Instead of just getting YouTube, you're getting all these other things So that's kind of what what I was thinking is like whatever the stack is that gives them everything that they need to follow your system On top of that if they want support Community access whatever it's either by maria's one-on-one time or
00:36:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
into our group that's bigger than YouTube but definitely includes lots of YouTube conversations because I can't imagine you going week like not wanting to talk about hey guess what's happening you know right right right and there's a whole other aspect that's not going to be covered on this part of the course but I think if we're now making it for offer owners and affiliates I think a huge aspect of it is branding personal brand right um so uh yeah and I've got um a friend of mine who's that life coach Melanie Childers she's gonna either pop on then or just do a separate call to help specifically the people that mess to be that said they're little scared to get on camera so that's just gonna be a bonus recording your space this YouTube accounts that that do really well so if you wanted to go do some research on that you'd be able to provide answers to those those people they can do really well yeah yeah yeah It's funny because I I I I've been in the last few months of faceless YouTube school community and she's she's made six figures herself with a fitness faceless thing um which is kind of cool and she just bought PLR to some fitness videos and created a youtube channel and think I mentioned this to you called five minute exercises or something but yeah go ahead.
00:37:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you know that less than two percent of youtube creators uh you you tubers create their own content that less than two percent of youtube accounts are actually create their own content less than two percent.
00:37:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
where'd you get that stuff from?
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:37:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Look at it.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah because it's um it was um it was comparing tiktok which is even lower it's like 1.5 on tiktok and then two one percentage of you tubers create one and four of those creators and create video content. So that's 25% still.
00:38:08 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow, it's very low. It is not what people would think you would. So, so is that meaning the rest is faceless?
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that kind of what? No, it's it's saying that it's curating content.
00:38:20 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, like, clips, somebody else's clips and you add something to it. Oh, got it.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. it. But it's not their own original content.
00:38:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, first of all, what I mean is that the opportunity out there for people who have something to say is huge.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also for people who don't want to be on camera, if they're following your strategy and creating the content according to your style, so they could do whiteboard drawings and have a picture of themselves or no picture. But as long as it's First of all, it's not all have to be visual, but if they're following your plan, let's say they get 25% less results than you do because it's faceless.
00:39:11 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it still not amazing results compared to nothing? Right.
00:39:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So it's still tapping into YouTube. Maybe you're not getting full power of YouTube because of this. But YouTube is a content provider. It's not just a face of your video, you know.
00:39:34 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I know, I think I mentioned this to you. I know one guy I consulted a few months ago. He was just buying the master resource rights and private label rights to faceless videos on Etsy. He bought them, then he created a frickin funnel. He's making 30 grand a month selling them via ads to his funnel. Here's a thousand faceless reels and he has a little died on how to do faceless reels and TikTok videos and YouTube shorts. And he's so doing so well, I haven't heard Boo from him for the last two months.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how well he's doing. Do you more help on this? So I wanted to get into that for a long time too. So we can do a case study where I'm following everything that you're doing. And they're following me while I create some content that is around. So like I got a, I told you about domain, videoprofessor.ai. So I'm like, what if I just teach all my stuff, but I don't, it's not about my face, it's about the content or whatever, what kind of results does it does it get? So and I'm a huge fan of leading by example. So for those people that have those questions, you could say, look, worst case scenario, you spend $97 and you learn that it is possible or it isn't possible. But regardless, you're going to learn, is the knowledge worth the $97? This is what this is so so this is what I teach people all the time They want to think that their money has to get a specific kind of outcome like that has to be money I'm like, but when you go to college, you're not guaranteed a job. You have a degree You paid for the education.
00:41:17 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh Consider yourself paying for the education.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're coming here. There's no way you didn't learn something There's way you didn't know what you didn't hear something now you have to ask yourself And I'm going to pay Maria for teaching me that so I had a new thought that's going to lead to a new thought That's going to lead to a new thought that cannot be measured the thoughts. So here's another thing Anyful can count the number of seeds in an apple, but only God can count the number of apples in a single seed Because in that seed very tree the tree bears apples those apples bear seeds those seeds bear trees and so on and so on and so on When you teach somebody a new thought and a new idea that is the seed that will bear. So it's important to use that. think you teach people and say when you're looking at this investment, like I'm going through a course right now and it's $2,000 and I found somebody way better. And he's got a refund and I'm probably not going to finish this course and I'm thinking, do I ask for a refund because I found something better? like, well, no, because I learned from him.
00:42:24 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right.
00:42:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I found something better.
00:42:27 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But if I go buy a dress and then I go find that dress, I'm not going to go return that dress.
00:42:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people would.
00:42:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Some people would like.
00:42:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not if I've already worn it and tried it on and I go find another one and I never wear that dress ever again. You know, that's just part of the buying experience. But I'm not going to take away from somebody who moved me through and gave me some new ideas and thoughts. Maybe they weren't one, which is another one. The last I will say, when I market things and talk to people, I'll plant the seed of business karma. do you want to be a chronic refunder? Because you reap what you sow. If you don't want people doing that to you, don't be that person to other people.
00:43:14 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. no, I'm from believing that too. $2,000 course was that you bought?
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Day trading.
00:43:23 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay.
00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I love it. I've always loved, like, I feel bad about now because I know more about horses, but the first time I ever went to a horse track, I picked the winners all but like two races. I'm just really good at stats and processing.
00:43:40 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, I don't like to see how that goes.
00:43:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I also want to understand the stock market a lot better than just the economy and how that goes. anyway, I did that. then I was like, man, this other guy is like way faster because the one that I'm learning from, he's so slow.
00:43:54 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he doesn't go linear. It's not well organized.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is he just brain dumped everything that he knows and it's good and it's useful But he isn't the best teacher Yeah for learning, you know, if somebody's better at teaching, gonna learn so anyway.
00:44:13 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, it makes sense Got it. Yeah. So anyways, um, yes to to that and it is on the rise and like You know, obviously there's gonna be so many Aspects of future changes of how AI is going to play a role in this, right? Cuz do you want to go like you and I talk about this the other day? Hey, Jen, right to create a duplicate of you and and to create videos for yourself, you know But I will tell you what you just said though that very few create their own stuff. That's probably why some of my videos Do so well because the comments are like you're so authentic like it because I think it comes across versus if it was just crowdsourcing what other people say. look, I'll admit, some of my videos is kind of crowdsourcing bit because I'll look at what's top and ranking stuff. Oh, this guy did a video on how to combine chat should be T and create an ebook.
00:45:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I've done that before, so I'm just going to teach it too. So there, there is another thing. And I wish I could quote it for you, but I've heard it from two people. But because there's so much information, it isn't about content creation so much as content curation and distilling. So what people need isn't all this information. That's what we've been selling as info marketers for two decades. Yeah, yeah. And we all know that it's paralysis by analysis and overwhelming all of this stuff. The winner is the one who can take the complex all these things and break it down. why I get paid so well, but also what I've seen you do is you break it down to small strategic steps. If you're talking about creating a list that they can go outsourced, you don't get more simple than that. I would say a few reasons, but I would say the biggest reason that you're being successful and will continue to be successful is because you have the ability to distill complex and and big quantity down into small things, but then you add your personality and your love on top of it. But that's difficult to replicate, so but if you can teach people that if they can do that, so they don't have to have the same personality or necessarily articulation, but whatever they know, if they can take what they know into the simplest actionable steps, people will love them also because it saves them time.
00:47:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and mental energy and their brains are tired. Yeah, and I was going to start the the the off of drawing a big circle and saying this is all the information about YouTube and how you can make money with it monetize it. I know this much about it. I'm not saying I'm the expert on all things YouTube but I know that this little bit that I've been able to do has produced results and that's I'm going to teach you this a little bit so you're not overwhelmed and you can choose to learn all the other stuff if you want later but just do this as your foundation and you will get results.
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep it simple, you know. I'll add one more thing to that. Is your goal to learn everything that there is to know about YouTube or is your goal to have YouTube help you get be the vehicle to the life that you want to making the amount of money that you want because if that's your goal you don't need to know everything about you. You need to know just enough to get to the results that you want to get to so it doesn't matter that I only know this part because I know the part that gets me the amount of money that I want in the amount of time that I want. That's what you're teaching.
00:48:05 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that. That's it in a nutshell.
00:48:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because people don't quantify. They don't ask themselves this or that. So they go in and I think I need to be a YouTube expert, which relates to I need to know everything there is about YouTube. How many times have you heard somebody say I got to go study and learn everything there is to know about this? Yeah.
00:48:25 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I wrote out the books this year.
00:48:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What did you and part of that's buffering though too.
00:48:32 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're feeling busy because they're learning but they're actually not doing and making money and getting proactive avoidance. That proactive avoidance, that's the words you use all the time that I love proactive because I'm writing this down so don't forget and that because there was a guy yesterday that asked me what makes your YouTube course different than the others right and I'm going to write this down proactive avoidance. I just said because you're not going to have to spend tens of hours like in other courses to actually try to figure it out. I'm just going to give you a simple system that's worked for me and got results.
00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I would say further, here's how I can prove it. at how many videos they make and look at how much time they spend on YouTube. And look at me, you're not seeing these about hours and hours and hours and hours of video. I'm putting out.
00:49:16 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It seriously is like three hours a week, they can do it.
00:49:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you can ask that, do you want to live on YouTube or do you want to live?
00:49:24 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't wait to get sales page rock and so you can add to it. All right, on that note, candy people are going to start coming, the little kiddos.
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I keep seeing you go like this, so we'll let you know.
00:49:40 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
because well, I don't know how well you can see it, but that's the the outdoor. So I'm waiting to see kids walking by because sometimes they have already been some people walking by. And so it's getting dark as you can see. Yeah, yeah.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my daughter needs to be done, lock the door for me. All right, she's got back. Okay, I will talk. See you soon. Have a good weekend. Have Halloween. Thank you. you. All right.

Hey.
00:00:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Hey.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I'm good. I'm good. a little bit of running around today, this morning. Yeah, your ends up kind of stuff. But I've finished up a quiz automation in those building or updating for 10 and get that over to him to review before I publish it.
00:00:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. How's that going with him?
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
mean, it's going well as far as I can. As far as I can tell, you know, we his Facebook group has like 7,800 members and it's hard to get good engagement, good response or get steady responses on the post. So the ones that do best or when it's like, hey, I've got this cool thing I use in my gym, who wants that kind of thing. And I did a post like that last week and said I need get like 50 comments to share the ads that Tim runs to bring in new leads and appointments and that's up to 77 comments now. Oh, Yeah, so that was good. So I think I'm just going to start doing more of those. And then we're. I'm just doing a Black Friday promotion. Well, it's not his Black Friday promotion. It's a webinar, where we're selling a done for you Black Friday promotion for Jim. So that's happening in the middle of October that I'm teaching that. So I've written a lot of the, most of the promo copy leading up to that and then just updating some language on the registration page.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long did it take you to get 50 comments?
00:02:40 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We got to 50 like in three days.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. And what kind of budget did you have for that?
00:02:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's all organic. That's awesome.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's in this group. So how's the conversation going around your working arrangement? And how are you feeling about it?
00:03:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I own my follow-up back to a gross summit So sending is before gross summit. send an outline of of how how it would work with me earning a percentage and at the same time I updated my recurring charge to the three grand And So I didn't even just follow up on that email and and ask him if If he's had a chance to review it He took I guess he's got a cabin somewhere up in North, Arizona and he was there for 10 days or so Available but I've taken some time after the event, but he's back in this week.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. So what are you thinking about your conversation? how would you?
00:04:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How are you framing it in your mind? Well, I later all out in the email. So it's, I want him to respond to that either via email or getting on a call and in the hammering. You know, just talking through the details, but it's like, you know, I want to be, I want to be at 5k or 5k a month for the work that I do outside of, of Titans. And the way I frame it is like, you know, I'll be incentivized because to make that, I've I've got to basically to make an extra 5k a month for, or I'm sorry, to make an extra 2k a month on top of what he's paying me. have to, for the year, I have to sell 400 grand for him. And that would, that would generate 24k for me.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. That's how I talked about it in the, in the email to him.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Can I see that? Would you like screen share real quick?
00:05:39 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'd love to see what you put together. Yeah, let me find that. Thank you. Can you read that?
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That sounds awesome. You'd have to be just so greedy and stingy. Thank you. know that.
00:07:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a it's a good deal.
00:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Heck yeah, it is. And so well, I love the way I you did such a good job, like you covered all the points. So you did the simple math, you wrote down the caveat to you wrote down, you know, what applies to what and what doesn't. You like you framed it so simple, so clear. No brainer. I know people are dumb enough to say no to stuff like this. It wouldn't make zero sense. So but then you know what you need to know. If somebody can say no to this, you know all you need to know about them. There's it's not they're not rational. They don't value you. and the work that you do, because by definition, you'd have to have earned it.
00:08:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. So, yeah, exactly. mean, I think that, you know, there's a possibility for somebody to say, another possibility someone would say, no, is that it feels like they're not confident that that we'll be able to get an accurate... No, that's not what I'm saying. Like, for example, this Black Friday promotion that's coming up, you know, Tim's created that webinar. My job is to get people to the webinar. He then sells them on the webinar. And then we've also got, you know, email follow-ups to people who attend and don't buy. And so... And as I'm talking this out and maybe this goes to your point of stinginess, maybe the nicer way I would frame it in my mind is, yeah maybe it is stinginess, it could also be like him thinking, you know, I created the webinar, I'm selling them, and he's just running the promotion. So maybe like a not not valuing, not not seeing the value and the work and effort that gets gets people onto the webinar, I'm totally making this up, this is not anything you said. I'm just trying to like, I mean, some of it comes down, could come down to just like some laziness too, like not wanting to have to think about how much percentage does Chris get, which which I mean I guess to your point would tell would be an important data point for me as well and I mean basically if he may come back and say well there are some more deals I'd want to exclude from this and I'm open to that because I don't know everything about his business I know a good bit but I'm open to the idea that you know I've got a blind spot and I'm a reasonable guy but so we have a conversation if he thinks things other than the gross summit should be excluded and at that point like if we can do a deal then I know I've got a ceiling here with him a 3k a month and and that's sort of like the clock ticking on you know But with me to get me where I want to be. But yeah, I think it's a no-brainer for him.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, so right there, highlight it. 24,000 is what you get if you generate 480,000. Yeah, he did all the work or whatever. That's Trump change really for what it is. And like I said, if you want two things or both, stingy or doesn't see how you're that valuable. But getting butts in seat and qualified butts in seats is a real value proposition. You could have the greatest product in the world. You could have the greatest pitch in the world. If there's nobody there to see it, doesn't do any good. If the right people aren't there to see it, doesn't do any good. So that's what you're doing. Yeah. know, it's it's it's brick and mortar business.
00:11:57 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's location, location, location, right?
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Offer in the world greatest pet you greatest from mama pro promotion and you're out in the boonies Nobody's ever gonna see it. Nobody's ever gonna buy it. Okay, so that's what a digital offer is until You have somebody writing the copy and doing the ads you're doing both Two things copy on its own no good without ads and people seeing it Add on its own. Oh good. It's not good copy good offer. So You know, yeah, that is all that is a it's two major services you're offering That in and of themselves That that fee Yeah, anyway, yeah, it is great So yeah, I'll just reply to this email and The just do one more thing in the example so that there's no like sticker shock So when you go 5% of 27,000 he's not doing that much like $1,300 or something like that.
00:13:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's like almost all right.
00:13:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we if you look at that and be like, okay, I'm still not even paying you $5,000 if I make $30,000.
00:13:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would put that number there because you look at it and goes, Oh, you generated $30,000 and I'm still not even paying you that $5,000.
00:13:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
was paying you before.
00:13:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, yeah, that's a good way to put in parentheses.
00:13:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
$1,300.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would put which brings my total to $4,300. And I think it's like, it's probably probably $13.50. Let me go do this. So what the heck? $27,000 times 0.05, $13.50. So that would be $43.50. And I would put that total there in the example and go, which is still less than the five.
00:14:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
a thousand you were originally paying me monthly. Yeah.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's the framing of that. That makes it go. Okay. Like honestly, he should feel crappy because you got downgraded, but you are upgrading everything that you're giving to him.
00:14:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, he's and he's tossing like more, more, more my way.
00:14:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you doing your effective hourly rate calculations when you're doing this work with him?
00:14:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I know that I want to keep it to five to six hours a week. And like today, I worked, I did two hours working on this infusion self automation and so I knew that tomorrow I won't spend as much time on his stuff. So I calculate your real time. No, I don't have a time chakra, I know, because my morning is my time that I do this kind of work. It's like, I've got my Tim and my Titans buckets. And I usually just write for an hour for Tim. But today, I don't know, because I need to actually build this automation, which I'm, and I documented it for him on a one-pager so that he could just see, because there's a lot of stuff in this automation. And he should see that and recognize what else I can do. What else I can do? Like it's a beast. Yeah, that's also an asset that he owned forever more and also that he could replicate and sell like Yeah Yeah, like this so they had done They had the bones of this built because they've got a they got a quiz they built this quiz Which which like so they they had like this This This built what I went in and did is I created a Nurture sequence to bring people into the quiz And then I'm pulling them out if they've already gone through the nurture sequence and then the big thing they want to sell is called business accelerator and Yeah, and accelerator I know I know and I'm saying be a and I'm in my character advertising, so it's like But Then these people here, if you score in one of these tags in the quiz, then they were putting them into a business accelerator. These were the emails that they had up there and they weren't really ready. I created this sequence here from the promotion that I wrote for them in June or May or June and it's pretty nice. set it up so it runs on specific days so that this promotion is always ending on Monday when people go in and then when they finish it, there is a tag that completed and then I'm giving them a soft docked out here so like not interested in getting my help to hit 30k. a click here or move from this promotion. So they can click that instead of unsubscribing. Right. Takes them to this page. And I even link to the promotion so they can look at it. And when that happens, they get tagged here, soft opt out. And then I'm looping them back into this hold. And inside of this hold, it just holds them for five months. And then kicks them out and then checks to see are they a business accelerator customer. So they go here, if they're not, then I'm going to put them back into the nurture sequence. And then anybody on the list that is not, so I created this check to see if they've been through the nurture sequence. So you can. Not anybody into that and then it'll go and see arcade have they been through the sequence before If they haven't then they're going to go straight into it if they have They're going back into this holding bin For the five months and Yeah, so though like those things are the things that i've built and And Added for him so i don't know that he's looked at the shot but Uh, his partner randy has and and really likes it And so i just put together this Wrote this up this morning so he could read it just to see the flow Like if this wasn't high level that kind of snapshot could be sold for a thousand dollars like that automation in and of itself could be thousands of dollars I get annoyed when people don't value you properly
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You already made that money drives me nuts.
00:20:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. mean, I think Tim's got a lot of money flowing out.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. But here's the thing. If you want more to come in, then you pay it to the people who bring it in. Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying and the people that help you keep it or and the people that help you keep getting more out of your existing assets. Like, that's the thing. It's there's a lot, you know, so many majority people are spinning their reel and it's feast or famine and it's their fault because it's the way they operate. It's the way they manage their business and you come in and you bring structure and leverage and consistency, which reduces stress. That stress relief is a real world value. That's a real life quality, real currency, real value, especially because reducing that allows him to operate at his higher level, which is where he is able to make the most money and not go crazy. Like, you want to get in the habit of learning how to express that that's what you bring into the table. And then one of the ways you can do is say, my goal is to block, right, to take off this load. And you can even insert things like, you know, I study psychology, I understand Maslow's hierarchy of needs. And I know that when we're stuck and we're in the vicious cycle, like, we just aren't operating at our highest level. And so when I'm coming to the table and I'm coming to the team, my job is to make sure that there is no, you know, pain and suffering. that we're all operating at the highest level that self-actualization, right? That's where we're delivering the most magic to our clients. That's where we're feeling the most magic ourselves and our teams. That's where the money flows, but not just for us, for our clients. And then they're able to deliver their best version of the product to their customers. And so I don't want you to think you're just getting a copywriter or a guy that does ads. Like, I'm, I bring all of this to the table, and hopefully you've already kind of felt some of that. Like, you want, so you might notice a little bit that it's not so dark anymore, right? But there's a whole level of degree of lightening that happens between coming over the mountain and high noon. It's so subtle that you really don't notice, but there is a distinctive difference in the level of light and warmth that happens in that process from like say 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.
00:23:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right?
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At peak level. And it's so subtle, it's almost imperceptible unless somebody is really paying attention to, oh yeah, look at where the sun's at right now and think about the warmth that it's giving and think about the light it's giving. We don't, we take it for granted, but where would we be without the sun? Right. So it is human nature to just kind of be in the warmth, bask in that light and that glow that is just offered and not notice it. So you have to help people notice it.
00:23:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's a good point. I do remember when I first started, Tim was Vlad and surprise that I knew how to use a diffusion soft. Yeah. and that was just being able to send broadcast demons. Um, but he, uh, will be the first time he's seen me build something a little more advanced.
00:24:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'd be like, boy, I'm just getting started.
00:24:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
come on. Let's go. Tim is like an expert builder and infusion soft. So I know that he'll appreciate it.
00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but he didn't have to do this. Like you saved his brain power and like, like, I know you can do this, but I know you got higher level things to do and saving you super power. I like doing that for you, you know, like, maybe don't love doing it.
00:24:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it's, I do enjoy like thinking through, uh, I'm not like, a, uh, a bill. But I do, like, thinking through how to, like, how these automations flow, that is fun for me. But I don't think I'd want to be building these all the time, I'd get, my head would just be too full.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There are so many people that you can get now that are low-cost overseas that, like, like, five, ten years ago, there was hardly anybody that was good at it. They weren't great at it. They weren't engineers. There are engineer level type automation specialists for $15 an hour, you know, that you can get, who get most of this. And so if you have a few maps and say, okay, go replicate this, but insert this type of which is a lot less moving pieces. and waiting for the campaign to open and to load and to give the attributes and all of that so they can do the actual connections and logic which takes more time and you can just kind of brainstorm it and then you've got basically these different maps and templates but then you're also thinking about the nurturing sequence like it did now you're talking about the customer experience so you this is tip to tail entry to exit your this is not copy this is everything from the beginning to the end other than actually fulfilling or doing the live sales but everything else you are touching touching and nurturing and optimizing and leveraging and that is high high value you're like several people in one for $3,000 a month. Don't just, ugh, don't let me see this bull, okay? All right, all right, right, all right.
00:27:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So yeah, I got to follow up with him on this, on this email and and yeah, I feel like things were, things were going really well. With, with 10. Everyone seems to be, everyone seems to be happy.
00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something to be said for going through it with people though. If, if they will reward you, you know, I've done that a lot of times and you stay, it's just, it's just different. Like I do business different, like we get in and it's like we're putting an elbow grease here in the trenches with people. That is not the most. Leverage thing to do in terms of instant revenue and return, but it is extremely leveraged in loyalty and The the depth of those relationships and how long they last and how long they continue to bless you is Is is very different and for me. They're more fulfilling When you know you brought somebody through it and they know you brought somebody that you helped bring them through it it's it's a whole different kind of thing and You know, you don't you don't just get that in any type of Arrangement, so that's something to think about to you know There's there's always trade-offs in the types of deals in business that we do, but it would be really nice to see you connect with somebody who you know is doing eight figures and Okay, um would like somebody to spearhead marketing and important prove the offer creation and look at what money are they leaving on the table, you know, and just mastermind what's happening. You don't do the copy, you can approve it, right? You don't do the ads, you can approve it, you don't do the automations, but you approve it, like all the resources there, like that would be, that's ideal and you should be getting paid a good amount of money for that, $10,000 a month. They'll be happy to do it because they don't have to think about it, they don't, yes, they're paying for all the resources, but they don't have to manage it, you're managing it well, you're giving them a report of this is what it costs us, but this is what I've made us, know, all you're doing is just getting information from them and then reporting information back and they're getting paid because they built everything up to that point and now they need somebody trustworthy to manage it and that trustworthy is the operative award because there's not a lot of that.
00:30:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yep. Yeah, I point. It's interesting with Tim, know Brian too, it's so easy for me to, I know what the offer is, what they're doing, get a little bit of their personality and their voice and like, I don't run into the same kind of like mental roadblocks doing this for somebody else that I do, like if I was the face, you know, like if someone's coming from me. And I've thought about this quite a bit and there's a part of that whole world of like being, being the guy that. feels, prison is too strong of a word, but it feels to me like I would start to feel trapped of like having to the pressure of like having to be on all the being the face, but I like that because I've got these, these things that come up as like, oh, just doesn't feel fun to me, but at the same time, like when I was doing wookers. I didn't feel that because, you know, the different, a difference there was we were selling this tool and, and I had a customer support team and so if anybody had trouble using the tool, it was just like, send them off over there and I've got, I've got this idea for a software that I've been researching a little bit to see like what's out there, but I first wrote this down when I was getting started to learn a little more about email deliverability and, and I was working with Adrian Savage from email smart who I still work with him in his team was, was solution that would take leads that come in through your regular forms and automatically input them into an infusion soft form behind the scenes so that if somebody is opting in through for lead magnet or even a purchase on a non-infusion soft, and this applies to any ESP, or CRM, but that it would then take that information, put them into, you know, get the tags and everything from the Thrive themes form, put them into a infusion soft in the background as a solution to be able to mail the people who are opting back in on your third party form, and sell that as a
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a as a software solution yeah I mean I wonder I wonder what the demand is for that but I'd like you thinking about SaaS again something I've been thinking about too is is just really kind of different leverage offers so I'm the same way with you know wanting to be the face and always be on I hate it I did a video and I boosted it as an ad on YouTube and it was short and it wasn't even good it wasn't made to be an ad but I did it because I have to push myself out of my comfort zone to an extent I don't have to but there's a lot of leverage in showing up and I want to do that on TikTok but I don't like doing it myself so I found this lady she's been around like 20 years and really I Ideally, it would be somebody like me would be my ideal business partner, because personality, energy, values, language, all of these things are important to me. But being able to have somebody that's in integrity, she's like a female version of a lot of these male marketers that I'm just like, that language is not, but she's not. She was just a woman in man's world and so kind of adopted some of this stuff. But she has been making other people millions and millions she's made millions, but just and she's like mid 50s and she stays home and takes care of her mom and but so much time spending and taking care of other people. And she's but she's all over the board because she's got this hustle mentality. You know what? I can just create some structure for you so easily. And we barely talked and people are like giving her comments like, you're back. You're amazing. Your energy's amazing. You're this. You're that. And I'm like it doesn't take much. I love that. So what I get in return though is she's really great at marketing She's all over the board for herself, but for other people she's really focused Yeah, and she's able to get it done and she loves showing up on video and she has no problem with it And I'm like, you know what we could do to talk lives together And I only have to show up long enough to have a conversation with you You she loves talking about things every morning. She's writing an email every morning. She's doing a video And I'm like, that's amazing like so I'll just let you do most of it I'll do my part and I'll bring something to the table, but she's never been served the way she serves But I would do that you never been served the way you serve and I think Finding that person and they're going to be somebody like you that's just they don't act like a face. Really maybe they do sometimes But they are just consistent and the way they show up or or they're really inconsistent and they in the way that they show up as the face and then they disappear because they are all over the board and so they need a rock like you right they like you know being on video and they like talking and they like promoting but they don't know how to run things smoothly so they're always working they have made lots of money for other people right but not as much for themselves so just starting to like kind of put out your feelers and your intentions to attract somebody like that that you can align with who knows they don't want to do it by themselves but they do want to do it and they want to show up every day just not by themselves because of the riffing because of the face because even if neither one of you really wants to be the face you can do it a little they can do it little you can do it together that energy feels very different it's not like being on it's just like talking to them and kind of taking that, capturing it sending it out. So like we were talking this morning about her and I just doing conversations on live on TikTok because the audience there is so, there's so much of the untapped, Facebook attracts the people that are in the old I am crowd, The hardcore marketers. So they bring in the people that have been brainwashed and you're competing with that. TikTok is all over the board. These are people like just hearing the ideas for the first time. And so they don't have these predisposed opinions about what things should be, whatever, and they're just easier to persuade. They're not jaded like people on Facebook. And so we can go over there, have some conversations, take the, so do TikTok, TikTok likes consistency. have to show up. Tube likes quality. YouTube does not care if you're consistent. YouTube just wants you to create something that people want to consume. Stay on their platform. They will send your one-year-old video over and over and over again, as long as people are still watching it and they don't care if you've never created another video. So we can take the best of the clips from TikTok and turn that into a quality YouTube video. Put that over there. The thing about YouTube is it gives amazingly targeted low-cost leads. So without it feeling like a drain, it will just feel like I'm showing up talking to Maria but we're doing it on TikTok live and it doesn't feel like pressure because I'm just having conversation with her and people are observing and I would do that anyway. I don't have an issue with it that I wouldn't think about it so much. Whereas if I'm talking to a camera, it's exhausting to my soul. I'm looking at myself going, this is
00:41:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So douchey, I hate it.
00:41:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's it's not it's necessary, but it is not organic and not natural. And I don't like it. And I don't want to do things that don't look so I don't. Yeah. Anyway, but I know because we're always in this evolutionary evolutionary conversation about what is your offer kind of what is your thing. And I think that for most people it should be a hybrid. So I'm not going to give up my high level clients, and especially like my doctors and my attorneys, I'm having the time of my life with them. Because these are people that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, you know, in in going to school, they're gonna be a debt for a long time. They're just used to paying for knowledge. And they're not like, I gotta make $10 million by the end of the year. And I need to make $10 million for every $5,000 I spend with you. know what I mean, debt service, he's like Tina, finally, I've been trying to tell you that you needed to like experience this. I'm like, I know, I know. But, um, but he's like, last night, he's like, I'm so glad that you're finally out of the IM world. I'm like, babe, that's never gonna happen and I'll tell you why. First of all, I wouldn't be where I'm at without having taken this path. But second of all, when moms and dads are trying to figure out how they save their family and how they get this extra income and they have no other way and they go to the internet, the first people they're gonna run into is internet marketers because internet marketers are the ones spending all the money to advertise to them. So I need to be there to show them, look, yes, there are all these opportunities, but here's what you need to do to guard yourself. Here's how you run real business practices, but you don't have to have an MBA and you don't have to be, you know what I mean? Like, very few people can simplify it like I can and talk to the average person and watch out for them. And because I have. of my other clients and my other business. I don't I don't have to charge them an arm and a leg. I'm planning on giving some of my best stuff away for free on YouTube just to be like learn it. And here's what I know because I've seen it happen with people over and over again. You give away your best stuff. Really smart people with a lot of money didn't have to pay to learn it. So they're watching you they're going, you know what? I want to hire that person and they will send you an email be like, how do I give you some money?
00:43:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
How do we work together? Yep.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ten to thousands of dollars and deals happen because somebody saw you thought you were smart but you have to show that instead of showing all your schmuckery and your like 10 million upsells and downsells.
00:43:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? I mean that's how Tim came to me.
00:43:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I'm saying.
00:43:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I threw the bootcamp.
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Saw your smartness out there. Like I got to get that guy.
00:43:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah maybe.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So put more stuff out. but it doesn't have to be your face. That's the other thing and I got to remind myself of this because yes it's a popular thing but people don't care if you're screen sharing and they can hear you and there's and there's like cap cut and script make it so easy to caption what you're saying and if the captions are right and you know how to do this because this is marketing magic and we do this right the headline the hook they need to see the right things and hear the right things they don't have to see your face so much and it could be your picture which is not the same thing it's not the same burden it's not the same energy cap cut and a script and loom now has AI editing so it's crazy you're just like oh take out this line and it automatically does it you don't have to go through that how do I like zoom into the timeline and get right to that one second and clip these words oh my gosh it is crazy easy how fast the stuff could be done. So whatever you want to teach, whatever offer you want to do, if you want to do it yourself, do it the way that you want to do it and trust that it's it's going to work because you teach simple, clear, fundamentals, you teach fundamentals too, because you've been studying the fundamentals from gene.
00:45:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.
00:52:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
A lot of that is I go through the exercises that I created for BAM on Desire and Product Performance, the channel, like channeling desire and market sophistication. Yeah, mean that that could technically be a that's interesting. That could be a series with the goal. I'm not selling a core or some selling like working with me.
00:53:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it could just be a soft like at the end. like if you, if this is something you want in your business, and you don't have somebody driving this, let me know, like I'm, I'm not the cheapest guy. I'm not the, um, the laborer. I'm the profit partner. So if you're looking for the, the guy to hire that works for you, I'm not the one. But if you're looking for the guy to be, you know, a profit sharing partner in your business, let me know. And it used to be soft. The other thing is you would drop in there. This is the exercise that I use that I created for BAM.
00:53:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
BAM, by the way, is right through advertising mastery.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it is a companion guide to Gene Schwartz is this, because I am partners with Brian Kurtz.
00:53:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so now you've just given your pedigree.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's going to be powerful too. But it up there. Right now I'm douchey way, like just like FYI, this is where this came from.
00:54:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's not a bad idea actually. If I looked at it as I'm not trying to sell a course, I'm but selling my services. Yeah, I hadn't really thought about it that way. It's funny like Brian and I, Brian just got invited to speak to this virtual. But to this group of marketers in Japan about breakthrough advertising and he looped me in. He's like, I want Chris to be on this call with me. This guy, Hyro or however you say his name, H-I-R-O. he's got a little community there in Japan studying breakthrough advertising. And. So, Brian are going to be speaking to them in December, and I mean, who knows where we'll come out of that, but it was like, I wouldn't have gotten invited into that if I hadn't done all this stuff with Break to Arotize it, so that was just reminder. I, do you know Esther Kiss?
00:55:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? Yes! She's awesome.
00:55:28 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, I don't know if she, I got a, is an automated email, but she reached out, she got on my list, and one of my sequences in the profit sharing thing, she replied, and asked if I was interested in any kind of PR or media work for me, and I'm not, I'm not interested in that for me, but then I was like, huh, it across my arm before, was like, uh, thinking of Break through Arotizing, like, if there was a more of a PR strategy for that book in media strategy to talk about like isn't this a cool story that here's this book that's almost 60 years old and still you know changing lives and we could talk about you know run some media about it kind of even showcasing it as a collector's item and and and and just go go out to a little bit of a broader market non people who aren't copywriters but I think that there could be a cool story of the history of the book and the story and who gene was and and just kind of build the allure around around this text and so I'm gonna I'm gonna do a call with her and the and Brian
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just to see what what she thinks about that As an approach Esther is so smart and she is so Real so humble like she's just she's she's one of those people, you know, just I don't know I think she's the same no matter what yeah, and I don't think she likes playing the game. I think she loves what she does and And loves when she comes across real genuine people and knows how rare they are. She's one of those really rare people Tell her I said hi we talked to her Yeah, she just we've never done any work together, but we You know when you you've got that just kind of vibe from somebody and you interact and you like for me I have these little love affairs with these ladies on Facebook and just like just adore you. I love you You're so smart whatever I gush they gush It's it's a mutual thing and then you don't talk to people for years and then it happens And again, and it's, it's just kind of amazing. I don't know if do that, but, but we women do that. Like you just really see each other and you're like, you're awesome. I think the men do too, because I have that similar interaction with men. a little bit different because you got to be, you know, respectful. it's very, because you say the wrong thing to the wrong person. like, wait a minute, he's married.
00:58:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're married. What is happening here? like, no, no, not like that. But anyway, yeah, right, right.
00:58:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, she is, she is, that would be really interesting to see if there's any kind of synergy there. And I wonder with Jeremy also, just because she does PR, he does podcasting, very similar kind of. It's a different path to this, to the same type of thing, which is awareness, brand awareness. Yeah, really. That's what podcasting does, right?
00:58:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Brand awareness and education, right?
00:58:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just pure, like a direct. response to marketing, which is a different type of psychology. It's it's like surgical marketing to me is what direct response is. Podcasting is like explosive marketing is like here's all the stuff. And PR is also surgical but it's like it's just it's not I mean it's it's I don't know like it's like getting stitches versus getting heart surgery. You know what I mean? Yeah it's interesting. Really keep. I say keep but because we've talked about it but I don't know that it's a big thing but that is the thing that I've been thinking about you since like 2020 2020 started talking about networking community is the people like that that are just really family or truth oriented like Esther doesn't have kids but she is a she is a mama kind of heart you know what I mean like she she she mamas her people and is loving and nurturing like just like you can tell that she loves her people yeah and making money is it's not a make money at all costs and it's they very much care about their relationships and I feel like I don't know you you also have much different values than just making money yes finding those types of people and having exploratory conversations with like what can we do together how can I help you help me but what can we create together and especially in terms of like content that maybe you can put out out on YouTube knowing that if it's quality, it can last forever and just be a beacon to the person, God will send them to you because he's amazing with that. Yeah, yes. Anyway, I'm excited about everything. I feel like I shed the last bit of the snake skin of COVID. You know, like the whole holding back, like it was happening around the beginning of this year, which is wild because that was a long time. And now I'm like, it's not like it didn't happen and there's not real things because we feel the after effects, but it is that I'm not sitting down for the next 10 years. I'm not taking it easy for the next 10 years. I'm not to burn myself out, but dude, I'm going to school. I'm on a mission. I'm doing all these like partnerships, taking care of my kids too. And I'm exhausted and I'm the happiest I've been in.
01:02:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
in a long time. That's awesome.
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Being exhausted for having labored well is good. But also I nap like two or three times a day sometimes. Yeah.
01:02:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Naps are awesome.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. I love Naps. Yeah. Okay. So let me know how Tim replies to you.
01:02:23 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't go all month. I mean, I guess if you're feeling great about things, but I'm still here. I'm here to do feedback on anything. Oh, my stuff. I don't even know. Like you can tell I'm all over the board. I don't know if there's there's stuff for us to do or not to do, but I don't want to waste your time when I get to it. And maybe I just keep helping you with yourself or whatever. And we just maybe we share the back and forth of here's what I'm working on. Here's what you could add to it. Here's what you're going take from that kind of thing. but yeah you we we got to get you to what you really deserve you've been running fast.
01:03:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah it's yeah I mean no pressure you know how to reach me if you want to kick some ideas around. I do have I did get an introduction to this young financial advisor here in town because I found somebody in TXL that works in the financial space with advisors and I've been I've been really interested in wanting to explore marketing and selling these infinite banking concepts and so I did call with him yesterday and he's not really into infinite banking but he does know the financial advisor space and so he he said there's a guy in Nashville that he does about half million a year he's like mid to late 20s and he did this great True to this guy. He's super responsive. So he and I are going to meet on October 7th. And he's got a podcast that he does. I just want to learn like what he's doing and let him know what I'm looking to do, which is I want to create the marketing. Like I don't want to write the policies at all. Like I don't want to get into that, but I want to sell them to people. And if I do this, I can get my life insurance license over weekend and then earn the commissions of the policies that I help sell.
01:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I keep forgetting about that. And you know, Business 101 is diversify. That is the best moat against poor economic times. The money is not Ever going away like ever. It's always out there and and we have so much access to it, but the average person isn't thinking about it. They're not trying to. They're just worrying about it. You If you have different areas that you can get to, but they're not consuming and they're not taking all your time and they're not taking all your energy and you're just building a machine like an engine, right? We've talked about around each of these types of things in the beginning, they're way more work and investment, but then you get in and you figure out how they work and you figure out how to leverage it. But I love that. And I love it being in, you know, the financial space where you can get money working for you plus the helping other people do the same thing. Like that really feeds the mission that you've always had, which is give back help others. And in terms of like business, but I think it, I don't think it had to be business. think business was the vehicle that you had naturally, but I think. Think that like kids you you so the proper type of stuff like huge I think you just want to see everybody be free powerful and happy and it doesn't matter how it gets there As long as it's something you're interested in you want everybody else to have it which is also about you Free powerful and happy I'm gonna write that down And those I want for people All right, I gotta get my girl. Oh go get her. Yes. All right. have a great day It's great talking to you and don't be stranger

I'm sleepy, I got up at 5.30, but I'm good.
00:00:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It breaks your throat behind me, I was gonna think, oh yeah, that's funny because you know what honestly I'm just waking up like I woke up early but I feel kind of groggy too but I know I'm getting better and I wrote out instead of reading the Bible this morning I actually just wrote out one of my favorite ones is I can she I just wrote it right but what I'm loving I have this for like seven years I've barely used it I use it for videos for posting videos online and stuff but I have this big it's not it's not your your smaller size I've got I'm just gonna bring it just so you can see the size of it.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like yeah, so I'm using Notability and I'm he's not even bigger than mine I've got the iPad Pro and I thought I had the bigger one but maybe they go there.
00:00:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is like the 12.9 inch on a second. Okay, maybe it's my head small.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. No, I mean, I'm Hold on. No, yours looks way bigger.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And a little for comparison.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was a pretty big Bible. That's yeah, I mean, this is this is mine with the magic case and stuff. I didn't know they go.
00:01:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They've got that big double point. No, let's see. This is my iPhone.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 15. See, Jesus, maybe yours is the same size. It's just kind of the optical illusion of me.
00:01:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When we show you this alert, this is my this is my lock screen.
00:01:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, cool. I love him.
00:01:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you doing on your big old iPad?
00:01:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, so I have this app called Notability.
00:01:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You ever heard it?
00:01:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not sure I have actually. Okay. So it's just an app where, like besides just knows the stuff, he didn't get right on it. But what I've been journaling on it, right? So you saw the picture of it from my yesterday, so that's what I was using, you know, I was writing on it. So, and I just grabbed like a template, so it was right, and then what I do is I used to do marketing videos on it, that's kind of what I have it, like yesterday's thing, like I make it in Canva, but then, you know, I put it here, see, and then when I come up, then I might have a graph, but then I can, you know, talk to it, right? Yeah. so here, then I kind of, you know, draw it. So it kind of keeps people's attention, right, when you're drawing on it. And ages ago, I used to use it, I have a stand for it, so I used to put it up here and then just record my videos, and then upload it to Facebook or Facebook ads, whatever. So, of course, video ads made easy, and I was trying to people how to record the iPad or their phone. It's I like drawing. I guess that's why I got the bigger screen probably QA is that way you got the bigger?
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that and my older lady eyes. Yeah Yeah, this stage where I wear glasses all the time except for when I'm working on a screen cuz I have to go like this. Yeah, I had coke bottles losses from age seven till 20 Six maybe and I got LASIK But now they're they're starting to disintegrate again and So what happens now do you have to get LASIK together? What do they say to freedom? I would probably really just have to deal with it because what happens when we get older is the muscles start to weaken and So the distance from near and far becomes more difficult But I'm like there's got to be an exercise and everybody's like nope There's no exercise and then I finally saw a video And someone's like, yeah, you just go focus out here, focus in here, focus out there, and keep doing it.
00:04:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, that makes sense. So I need to try that. I don't have good eye genes. I'm a little bit the same. look at Lasik, but I've been wearing context, gosh, since I was like 13. And for every step, I don't have to get it. And then now, you know, not only my 50s, I'm like, maybe I'll just wait. But yeah, this is interesting.
00:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If there's a surgery I can get, I will do it. I mean, Lasik was really painful, but it's still tolerable. it in the hours later, I had perfect vision, which was amazing because the peripheral, like I get a little vertigo and just oriented with the rims of my glasses. And then my hair and like, there's all this stuff. So I don't have my full peripheral access because of that. And yeah, I think if there's a surgery and also technology keeps evolving so quickly and we will. But because I have a stigmatism, I can't really where contacts, a stigmatism and the bifocal view issues, so it has to be some significant improvement in technology to really help me a lot, or basically get a new cornea.
00:05:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a high level surgery, and I'm not sure I'm going to go there, and that's not going to go there. don't You're right with technology. Who knows? Five years from now, yeah.
00:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So you are, you got a process to try to work on finding your compass, yeah. So sorry, I got a hair in my mouth. Um, we get to talk longer, tomorrow I'd love to just kind of like, hammer you with some questions and go deep, whatever, but for today what I would love to know is, do you feel like, um, you have enough to just keep you focused on
00:06:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
getting more clarity and I like to break things down by the week like if you have an idea like I know what I want to do today I know why I want to do it today my day is full if I get done at the end of the day and these things are done I will have felt like I was on track even if I don't know the big picture I have steps for my now yeah I feel I feel that like I feel more calm or comfortable that I think it's just more about also just taking the action as well to kind of just figure out what what the final kind of compass is right now so so direct answer your question yeah yes I have on my schedule like what I know I need to done today actually want to get your opinion on the power graphic I've started on your your stuff so it's a balance between my own stuff and then also client-like, but I'm really excited about the whole YouTube channel and helping women over in their 40s and 50s kind of reinvent themselves how to start making money online. It's very basic, but I think that's needed and I vacillate between working with beginners versus people for CEOs and already doing really well because I can do both, but I think by doing especially if we've probably come across this a lot for you, a lot of people are scared of getting laid off their executive job, and then how do they do consulting or coaching or do they do a digital offer? That's what I'm sort of playing with and I've got already laid out out of 10 YouTube videos that I want to do, so it's more just starting it and yeah, just kind of going with that. I did have another person reach out to me since yesterday's video. So I said, hey, I once bought left for I kind of thought I could use one more consulting client. So I'm going to probably just quote on something not like huge amount of per month because I don't want. I don't want the responsibility. I love creating. You asked me what brings you joy. I love creating. love low ticket funnels. And I thought, oh my god, I like, yeah, start focusing on that and help me with that. But also maybe make some in advance and flip it, right? Hey, I got a converting offer here. Try some ads for it. already converting. If you have a good back end that this works perfectly for your offer, know, buy this for me for life 15 or 25k, right? So it's done because a lot of people pay 20k to get something done, like, and they don't know if it's going to work, you know? or they're announced as paralysis because I don't to, know, to case really low compared to what, you know, but. uh he's like changed his topic for me three times the last you know 30 days so that's why I haven't started on his because like right when my meet and then we're gonna go with this literally few days later oh no I decided to change my offer I'm gonna do this so best how about we do front in here so I didn't even respond to him he's in front of my dude I didn't even respond to his last text when he said oh I'd rather do this of like I'm gonna come full service and no we decided on this you need to stick with it because you're going or you can pay a new price because I've already started this so if that's that important to you we're renegotiating that's a new contract that's a new price yeah your indecision is not my obligation is not my responsibility is is not anything we had an agreement you renegotiating opens my renegotiating so either we're done and I'm paid by or if you want help the price that you pay for your uncertainty is your
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
delay, but also my fee, because your uncertainty is not my burden.
00:10:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like that. That's good. Yeah. Oh, and then other things besides business, like, because I know a lot of it's about self-love, self-care, my nails done here straight. So, oh, you're both red. Yeah, I noticed that. And next week, I'm going to go get my hair highlighted, because I just, you know, everyone will feel good when we're doing that.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:10:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just have to figure out some of my office space since, like, I sprained my knee, and it's kind of hard to go up and down stairs when my office was. So, I'm right here, my living room, and I did bring my soft box lighting down to record part of the video yesterday. So, I'm kind of getting settled in on that. So, I think I'm making movements on that too.
00:10:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Yeah, it's the environment makes a big deal. When I go into the bathroom and I see myself and my hair looks dull and my energy. my color looks dull. I don't really wear jewelry because I can't.
00:11:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would. I love sparkly.
00:11:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love sparkly beauty. The beauty of the earth, the beauty anywhere, energizes me. I think it does that to everybody. look at beauty and you just, whether it's the ocean or the sunset or whatever, beauty is powerful. Sometimes people use it really superficially, but I think that there's something to be said for like even in Adam and Eve, we're in the garden of Eden and it was perfect and God said, go dress this garden.
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you made it perfect.
00:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to go do something to improve it? Like, improvements upon what we have is part of the plan to always, you know, all of these things. so if we are continually improving our environment, I'm adding more light, light. or color, for me, lights a big deal.
00:12:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't have enough windows, I'm depressed.
00:12:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If everything is really dark, I'm depressed. Yeah, so it's a big deal. So you going and doing that, creating the content, just pondering on your compass. For me, I call it an anchor because my compass is more a moral compass, it's my values.
00:12:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that can't be somebody else or something else.
00:12:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is my own personal values, but my anchor that everything is attached to is God. It's that I have a Father and a Heavenly Mother. And I want to be like my Heavenly Mother and I want to be like them. And I love them and I want to honor them and I don't want to hurt their children, even if their children are really mean and horrible to me, I have to remember that hurting them is hurting him. And so I have, you know what I mean? Like I just thinking about those things. um actually creates my values and my compass comes from that but I don't I personally just don't think of it as my compass I think of it as my my center um maybe like the pole which my compass operates like it's my north pole kind of thing yeah yeah so but additionally you're you agreed to show up to talk to me every day so yeah for me I did this with you I got two other women that I will speak with weekly nobody else daily yeah but but I put that into my life um the exercising my mission and just all these little things and I draw a little bit of energy from it but the social part of it though especially the women yeah because we tend to encourage each other and also we catch each other if we're playing small yeah or you know if we're dealing with somebody who's a using us. And then, you know, that word gets thrown around very loosely, but tab using just means using poorly. It doesn't mean that you're baiting us. It doesn't mean that you're a terrible horrible man. But to pay for your time and to make an agreement and then to add more work on it because somebody changed their mind is abusing. It's not using you as a grade-upon outside of, you know. So I built things like that into my life so that I don't keep having it. You're building that. One way or another, things are going to just improve because of the compounding effect of the environment that you're creating and the energy that you're improving. So it's awesome. love how simple it is. And again, that's like a fundamental principle, right? It's just improve your environment. It's what you're having showing up in your life consistently and things just get better.
00:14:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. yeah, so like I yeah, so Oh, feeling good. You know, I know, um, as part of, uh, sort of into searching around my mom as well. And, uh, There's a little bit of codependency between us, right? You know, so, so even though I love spending time for, I can't spend every single minute of like a lunch or dinner with her because then I'm the crutch to her and she needs to start socializing on her own. So I kind of had that realization, like even like she's funny, called this morning. My brother was there on, can you stop by? was way to work. And so he picked up and said, I'm glad you're there. And they said, yeah, I brought my Macapuccino. So cool. And then, and then, and then, and then when I talk to my mom, So will I see you today? And I'm like, well, no pause there. And then you also have, we have one girl a week that comes and takes her shopping to her favorite grocery store and all this stuff, like the three hours spent time with her. And, uh, I said, no, you're seeing Lisa today. And will I see you tomorrow? Like she wants every day. And I said, well, we'll see, mom. But, um, you know, so, so that was a big, I mean, sort of realized that a while ago, too, because I know my sister even said she lives in five hour flight, but she said, you two really could pet her on each other, like she's come to, like, like literally, if I don't call her for a couple days, when I was sick about a while ago, I love five voicemails from her. But yeah, where are you? But yeah, when you come by, or if we could bring some orange juice to you, like, so it's adorable. But at the same time, I know that she's got a fly on her wings, too, and not just depend on me. So, because she's got a lot of friends, does art tomorrow afternoon for art friends. Like, got a lot of activities. I just don't want her, um, I guess what I'm saying is it was just a good realization and me encouraging her, because when she called me, why don't you call so-and-so your friend? Why don't you call, you know, this person, like, so I'm, you know, it's just, it's just a place that I'm co-hosting her, you know, it's that ever, it's that question of what's, what does she want? I still feel she'll be better socializing in a retirement home, but I also have to let go of the wheel and let her decide that, you know, that's the thing, yeah.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really tough. The one thing, especially working on my psychology classes is studying the difference between individualistic cultures and collectivist cultures, like Japan, China, Eastern cultures, African cultures, they're collectivist. They are more about the collective group and the community rather than the individual. The individual isn't lost though. It's just that we all are part of each other and we have, you know, Latinas are multi-generational houses and nobody calls that codependent because it's called family. And the thing about this individualistic culture I feel like there's a lot of the adversary of Satan, darkness that tries to pull families apart and cause it pop culture and psychology and says dependency. And so I would say trust your heart and your feelings. I do think we all need to work on our socializing. I think that our happiness is attached to a single other person, whether it's a spouse or a child or a friend or whatever. I think that's too much burden. I think that we're supposed to have bigger communities. But I do think that it is really a dark and poor thing that we have called it individualistic and independent and separated ourselves from each other. The happiest and the most, the longest living cultures have three or four generations in their house. They don't lock their doors, their windows are always open, nobody calls that codependency, they live the longest. I don't think it's Italy, but it's in that area. Yeah, so I would say that you have a very strong heart, and I think that that is what your compass is, your love and your heart. I think your love is. I think the reason you thought it was your dad was because you loved him so much, because he had so much of your heart. But really, I think it's your heart. I think your heart tells you what is true, I think that when we feel lost, we look for guidance, and I think we have to be very careful to not just who we look at, but what is the why behind it. solid are they in their compass? how happy are they? How happy have their decisions made them? Do they have a lot of love in their lives? Do they have really loving relationships? Are they complaining about other relationships a lot?
00:20:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they feel bitter and angry?
00:20:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're going to take advice, take it from advice from people who are happy, who are centered, who are peaceful. Yeah. But yeah, so it's a hard thing. for sure need to be able to have our own identity that just is us. But part of us is part of other people. Your mom still has your cells in her body. She is attached to you. It's tethered. It's not, she's not a friend. She's not, um, yeah. Anyway, just, just something I've considered, you know, my mom was really, really abusive to me. We aren't close, but I a thing about her every day, I want to get to the point where I can buy her as she wants a traveling van or an RV and just to be free and go wherever she wants to go. She'll never be able to do that for herself. And so my goal is that in five years, I can make that happen for her.
00:21:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Along with the ability to help her sustain that and but I'll only do it if she will agree to join groups where she can travel into other people. Because we don't have a kind of relationship where we can live together. Although I would and I don't plan on having a set house, plan being portable, mobile and going out anywhere. Otherwise I would make a place for her that was close to me even though we don't get along well because I think that that's how important it is. And God told us honor your mother and father that they days may be long upon the earth. And here's the thing that people never quote this by the way, but they also say parents provoke not nice children. and unto wrath lest he esteem thee as thine enemy. Always talk about honor your parents, but they don't talk about the parents role, too, honor their children. Anyway, some sort of thought as you're going through this, think adding the friends and the community is great, but if you just love being with your mom and it brings you, she's not gonna be here forever.
00:22:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I know, yeah, yeah. So I'm not gonna live in my house here, but with the dog and the cat, the dog's 85 pounds, and I'm scared. Yeah, knock your mom over. Yeah, yeah, it's little dangerous for her. Yeah. And she does like her own place. She likes her own solace. And then she's an artist, too, so she likes, yeah, that's why she was no, like, she even freaked out us hiring Lisa to spend three hours of her every Tuesday, who's a retired nurse and perfect for her, right?
00:22:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom's a retired nurse, you know? Strong woman, huh?
00:22:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah, no, thank you for that. That's that's that's And also, because yeah, Lithuanian is the sense is my mom and dad were born Lithuania, even though they met in Canada when they were, you know, in their 20s. But like our East European heritage, like typically, yeah, the parents live with the kids, you know, like, like my dad's sister had my dad's, actually they live side by side, they had two little houses side by side, you know. And so, but no, my mom's funny.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's like, no, I love that. I'm really excited about tomorrow, because I want to ask lots of questions, but I'm also really excited.
00:23:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
would love to see the power wrap right that you started. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not like, what do you call a, it's important just to be very simple about it, but I like it like the start of it. That's, that's kind of it. Oh, did I send you what Maui made? You sent me the Canva presentations.
00:24:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. I get to send this to you because I have a graphic sky. You're going to be annoyed that I've worked with for like 10 years. He's from the Philippines and I was like, I told him I was going to have it and want it. But I wasn't ready for it yet. But he's like, here, man, I already got to start it. I was like, Maui, I didn't even give you instructions yet.
00:24:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But this is what he made.
00:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I sent you on Facebook because I don't know how to download it from here. Oh, you sent me on Facebook? Hold on. Hold on. I will screen share with you. You're going to laugh. I think you're going to laugh. Watch this.
00:24:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's good too.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's beautiful.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like it. Yeah.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Why is there an iced tea? either. No, he is a goofball. I don't know.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he's generous. She got a dick in it. It could be coffee too. But yeah, he's really good.
00:25:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
By the way, you're graphic. he's he's wonderful. Um, he's got three daughters and a wife there in the Philippines. And he's respectful, so kind, works quickly. Very humble. Yeah, I love, I love the Filipino people.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're very good people. Well, I love it.
00:25:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, God. So any updated this spreadsheet for me too? Is this the right one? No, that's not the right one. Let's see if I can get animation of open client stuff.
00:25:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, Maui, can you go take, you know, put it in a spreadsheet? So like, I want to improve how this looks a little bit better. So I was working on that. The other thing, is this the right thing? Did you happen to take a look at this?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I know you told me about it this morning, but I haven't had a chance yet, but I will this afternoon.
00:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, I wondered if it might be helpful.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It would take a whole, probably five minutes. I don't want to, but if I just read it to you.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. how it flows because the difference of the text versus like my voice is the difference, right?
00:26:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah. Yeah.
00:26:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I'm gonna get my water.
00:26:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got.
00:26:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Um, probably needs to work on this, but anyway. All right. Hey there, genius. I know you're a genius because you just chose a path of working so much smarter. You don't know me yet, but you're going to learn very quickly that I am hyper excited about what I do. Part of that might just be the H and the ADHD, but I don't it. And what I can tell you is that if you're a person who's also struggled to focus, you are going to love what I teach you if you're willing to suspend your irritation.
00:27:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
about doing organizational tasks, everything I have ever done since high school has been around getting the greatest results from the least amount of effort.
00:27:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not because I'm lazy but because I despise waste and I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day and only a handful of those really spent on what matters to me. I want an amazing life and I figured out how to create that for myself. Along the way I figured out how to help people who have totally different values and mental processes do the same. The exercise you're about to go through has been life-changing for so many. It is deceptively simple. It looks like an ordinary spreadsheet but and I need you to really hear me on this. Pretend that the spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter but in real life it's a superhero. I first had people go through this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I have been delighted to learn that this exercise alone own was deemed worth the price of my full course at that time. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful and valuable in helping people make the most amount of money with the least amount of time and stress. I'll give you two other examples of how this exercise impacted two very different people. One, a voice coach and a musician who hated numbers and all things administrative. By the way, I have yet to meet a business owner who liked the advent and stuff, but she trusted me and so she did the exercise. When she finally finished the work, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. I'll link her testimony below if you want to hear from her. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music and she got there three years early. In fact, I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday, a video of her on a ranch inviting me to come visit. When I tell you I'm different, but I can get two results.
00:28:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope that you will trust me just enough to try this for yourself.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll also tell you got a doctor client in mind who just this week just did this exercise and how it flipped what he thought he knew about his business. He has multiple businesses with varying degrees of effort and profit margins. He was 1000% positive that one particular channel was the most profitable turns out. Another part of his business actually makes him $1,666 more per hour than the one that made him the most amount of money. So by switching five hours a week from one business to the other, he will make over 86. No, I'm actually did that math. It was like 430,000 more per year.
00:29:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
told you my math.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, 430 half a million dollars almost more. This is why you're such a genius because you're going to learn in just a few minutes, what wasn't taught in medical school and isn't taught how to be anywhere else, including business schools, but in tiny corners of the world where some someone nerdy like me figured out how to do some awesome math and you stumbled into one of those corners. You may not know how to make. But you may know how to make money, but if you do not know what to do to make the most amount of money in the least amount of time in your own business with your own skill sets, then you might be spending more time in low profit activities and cutting your earning power in half or more. That is what this exercise is going to reveal. I'm not going to teach you how to make money. You should not be here. If you don't already have a business that generates money. What I am going to show you is how to leverage your time according to your skills and your existing business. You will discover ways to improve things according to your own values, skills, and resources.
00:30:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There is nothing magic here, even if it feels like it is when you're done.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I will help you receive is clarity. That clarity will move you like few things ever have and you will do it with so much confidence. Do the work. Tell me your mom that you can't.
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Ready to see? Let's go. I love it. Love it.
00:30:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's perfect.
00:30:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yay! I love it I love it um so like when you do that video do you um do you do do captions underneath or are you gonna just let like we can do everything what I'll do is I'll start it first I think you should have captions because the study that I read is that people are watching videos at work or they can't listen and they want to consume the content so you need to make it so that they can consume it on mute wherever they're at whenever they're at perfect I also think maybe popping up some little emojis some little like one or two pictures of what it looks like or little things just the the engagement right so it's not just my face and just the words because we do have that ADHD but also if it's done right they reinforce the message your graphic artist seems so good if you give them the script you might come up with a few things things to keep me.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's that's a great idea. I don't have a video editor. But you know, what I should do is talk to him and see what kind of because I don't because I pay him hourly. And if he's got a slow machine and stuff, I'm not I don't I don't want him to do that. But yeah, I would love to be able to give him more consistent work. So I will see if he wants to get into some super simple video editing.
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, good idea. I'm like using CapCut or VDDIO. We have our guy. He's not as creative or didn't he doesn't listen to my instructions. So we have him back on Pinterest. But we did I did train him on these CapCut and how to do stuff. So he was able to do it for the Philippines. just though he thought he could do a lot more other things besides what I asked him to do to a video.
00:32:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, what are you doing?
00:32:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so yeah, but no, no big deal. But anyways, yeah, that could be cool. But
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's perfect like and that's huge about the doctor and meaning like oh my gosh I was like do yeah like this by the way is paid for my coaching for years if you actually implement what I've just taught you a five hour shift each week yeah the problem is that the business model he has has limitations to how much he can do and grow but but he had no idea he was 100% sure it was yeah I feel like it's got to be more than that I've got to do the math hold on a second that's huge no really huge what's tall well congratulations that's a big win so I get up with all the time Maria that's what these things do wait we do what sorry this activity that's what it does this happens all the time that kind of revelation that can result in millions pretty quickly if I'm working with high-level people and for low low where I don't say low level people, but lower earning people. What happens is that clarity confidence, which reduces stress. It reduces their mental friction every day. So even though they're not making as much money fast, I removed a huge burden. This, this is normal, like getting massive cause as normal anyway.
00:34:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, when I like about it, too, is that like even for me, like, even though, yeah, I still figure out the exact offer and, you know, what business I want to have over the next, you know, year, five years, even 10 years out. Um, but what do I do now? Like just doing that activity is like, regardless, like I was doing nothing to build my audience, like it was, it was like crazy and a lot of shiny object syndrome, you know, not going lie, like, oh, yeah, want to research YouTube videos and before I know it, I'm two hours into it. It's like, no, it didn't need. So it was interesting. was really good for me to go, okay, if I want to make money, I better start showing up more, period. like even if I haven't figured it all out yet, just show up more because I know that I used to teach people, hey, more lives you do the more money you make, you know.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you have way to capture the people that show up, like you have an offer to make because showing up doesn't do any good if you don't offer to drive them to follow up sequence to continue to nurture them to ascend them. So, you know, that's a big conversation. But yeah, for sure, I'm glad that that was insightful for you.
00:35:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, how can I just, I know we're supposed to get going because we want to keep this short, how can I help you get this low-tech offer off the ground? Because originally, typically I do the graphics, but you kind of had a guy do it, which is amazing, right? go with that. do you do you drink coffee, right? you drink coffee? Oh, you don't?
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then keep it as the iced tea. I don't drink iced tea either.
00:35:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, but typically, like I kind of put it up on like a could funnel page or something and and the person then imports that into their click funnels, or they if they have goal level, they import there. I'm looking at system I own myself because I got pissed off at active campaign tripling the price of my service. Yeah, they do a lot changes and they change plans and it's like my bill tripled. I like what are you guys doing them? So they're because they added AI in it and they added the sales pipeline management to it, but I don't want those features. So yeah, so anyways, so a lot of people I know are starting to use the system. But yeah, what can I do to help move the little ticket offer forward?
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got decided to use Wordpress and Elementor and funnel kit. And this is a landing page that I liked the template of and that's really too much for a this low ticket offer, but it's very easy to pick and choose a few things from here and then got everything else. And with funnel kits, they have really simple, and I didn't know she'd done this, a good job for her. Really simple stuff. mean, this looks like an onter page, really, this is the basic template for an onter page also. So really, I feel like I get the copy in my sales letter. The things that need to happen is ads follow up sequences. I don't know, you know, you've already has your offer and you know what you're do, you do, but any first of all, any just kind of directional support saying, okay, this is what we need to do next. Let's set a date, let's set a time. Giving feedback on the copy is amazing. But, you know, I haven't run ads in, I mean, 12 years.
00:38:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still think that I could do amazing at it, but I don't want to. I want to serve my clients. I want to create the content. So whatever I can tap other people's brains for and pay for or exchange, you know, my services for. Or that's what I want to do because, and this is what I teach everybody is the more types of work you do, the more friction you create because of the, yeah, get out of flow of, you know, if it's analytical, if it's creative, if it's administrative, all those different types of things, it takes a while to shift from one to another. And so I want to minimize the shifting and the only way that I can do that will the best way for me to do that, especially with the minimal amount of time that I'm that I want to work. And so that when I do what I do, I do it at the highest level is by using other people for the other things. Now, I'll probably always tweak some copy and be like, oh, let's do this. Let's do that a little bit. So I feel like I'm pretty good at copy and psychology and persuasion. But any help in the creation or suggestions or, hey, you should probably have a seven day follow up sequence for this. And maybe these are the bullet points or these are things. Anything that reduces my mental load by zooming me into the next step a little bit closer, just because I can get there doesn't mean that it doesn't help lift my burden.
00:39:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, have a good like a typically I deliver the load ticket off where there's like a little Google slide presentation and it's like maybe some suggestions templates for the abandoned cart email series. Wait, if you're using this template, is there an Abandoned carts. Do they first click a button and enter the email to get to the order checkout page? Initially, it's not a deal breaker at by any means.
00:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no funnel kit. Let me go Abandoned card to see what Google tells me Captain V. It's boost orders time. follow up some brothers. I don't know They probably your sales page example again.
00:40:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
me see what happens when they click the button to buy it That you're this one. Yeah, when they say get in there what happened? Oh, it takes right there Okay, so there's two choices You could just take them right there and we just test that out And then the next choice can be when they click that button kind of frank hernsel They enter their email not their name or anything else. They're just their email to then get to this page So then there's an automation that we can run that checks after life say 15 minutes Then they buy or not and if they didn't buy then typically a three email Series that's called a band and cart where it's like hey notice you Didn't check out finish your checkout process, you know, did like get in the way and you can include your customer testimonial, come back and buy it. But it's not critical because I just saw today, I was talking about lady that has a $77 frontend offer teaching people how to become fractional consultants. And she uses a Sam cart and she has no band cart and yet she's converting at 5%, which is really good for a $77 offer. So, you know, we could start with this first and then see what the conversion rates are and then go from there.
00:41:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I like that. And also, I've got my dev girl putting in Google Analytics on there to make sure that we can track all of that.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, beginning. Another note, like, I think you and I talk about this. Do you, are you going to start a YouTube channel?
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I know. I mean, I know that I mean, all of my business has been a word of mouth and it's always also and the way people I've had people recommend me who've never even worked with me because of my Facebook posts. So my content is powerful and it wasn't even video. I can't even tell you how many times I've been told you should write a you should do a podcast, you should be on video, whatever. So I know that I need to do that and I know that YouTube is the king for lower cost leads. You tap into the SEO power there as well. So yeah, I would want to create the content for YouTube and repurpose elsewhere rather than the other way around.
00:42:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I'm kind of attacking that strategy too. So I just because Facebook's good and ads are good, but it's just it's when you turn ads off for whatever reason that all of a sudden it's nothing, right? get no more traffic. Whereas YouTube, some of my friends that have started their YouTube tube channel even a couple years ago, they're still getting traffic from something from three years ago a video they did, right?
00:43:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what do we think about this over the other one? With the express checkout option up there versus this? I love when these things are up at the top, especially if there's Apple Pay. Should I do that?
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, because they already saw the sales page you clicked to buy, but go back to the top then again.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can get rid of most of the stuff.
00:43:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's very simplistic and yeah, that's fine. Let's see what that's there. It reminded me a little But what Shopify looks like, and that's kind of why I was thinking maybe subconsciously, that's a good thing. Yeah, anything that is familiar. Yeah, like the top part necessarily, but that part there. Right. Shopify sometimes, you know.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but just replace this with like a purple strip. What is Shopify as a blue or purple? I don't remember.
00:44:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it's purple. Uh, well, it depends on if someone changed the cart, because the standard one, I think, is just white with your logo will be on the top left, right?
00:44:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I think this will probably be better. Sorry, and that's the thing, I think, too, that will be great about our short calls is that, so when we get clarity on what are the steps, be like, okay, what did you do? And then like, okay, well these are the things I have to do, but I'm not sure if I should do this or this or This or this? Yeah, I think that is going to become a very big part of the conversation, probably for both of us. I was thinking this, I was thinking this, here's my criteria, got anything to add to it to help me kind of like narrow it down. And then obviously we make our own decisions, but that feedback with somebody who understands all the nuance of the decision is super helpful. And then, okay, cool, then I'm not gonna sit with that all day going should I do that?
00:45:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Should I do that?
00:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that little echo is just enough. And even if it's wrong, it doesn't even matter if it's wrong. Sometimes just hearing something back gets us to take action. We learn if it's right or wrong through testing.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're never going to guess everything correctly. Our opinions don't really mean anything. But we use them before we activate ourselves into action. Yeah. so anyway, but I think that I'll get inhabited being much faster with that kind of stuff and like.
00:46:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyways, anyway, cool. Love it. Okay. Wow. Let's go Have an amazing day. All right. See you.

Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.

Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.
