## Quote 1

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. üíô -end post- I‚Äôm Tina Marie, and I‚Äôm a business consultant that has helped several startups grow to million dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. To tell you how I got here, I‚Äôd have to go back a good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80 (think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route and made a good $65 a month. From that point on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made it happen. I worked in fields picking crops with migrant workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16 year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had decided I wanted to go into law. I managed to get a full ride to college and then quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when I realized I couldn‚Äôt stand the agendas and propoganda that came with the education. Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and started working in a call center that housed tech giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the ranks to account management during my 6 years there. I learned that I have a knack for improving any environment I worked in via optimization. My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even realized the power of what I had created. After the birth of daughters, I decided to figure out how to replace my full time income from home. While I went down the ‚ÄúSQUIRREL!!!‚Äù path that most entrepreneurs find themselves on, realized I could take my existing skills and find a home for them online. I‚Äôve been growing companies as a secret weapon on the inside ever since... all while having the time to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in sports and do the things that matter most to me. And now... 16 years after starting online and 17 years after my first child, I‚Äôm sharing my systems with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am. Working smarter and not harder is not cliche... It‚Äôs an anthem to live by. Follow me, and I‚Äôll show you :) 1. Math is Your Friend 2. Start with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 3. Mindset 3.1 You Actually Are Expert Enough 3.2 Being Broke Helps No One 3.3 Why You and Not Some Other Expert 4. Pricing and Packaging 4.1 10% Rule of Thumb 4.2 Lead With Value 4.3 Map a Value Ladder 4.4 Don‚Äôt Overthink It 4.5 Your Core Offer 4.6 Upsells 5. Example Scenarios 5.1 Scenario One ‚ÄìLowballed 5.2 Scenario Two - Bump the Core Offer 5.3 Scenario Three - Bump in Price + Conversion 5.4 Scenario Four - Vip Pricing 5.5 Scenario Five - Double the Upsell Price 5.6 Scenario Six - Tripped Up 5.7 Scenarios Seven - Lower Upsell Price 5.8 Scenario Eight - Lower Core Offer Price 5.9 Scenarios Nine - More Please 5.10 Scenario Ten - High Roller 6. Bottom Line Table of Contents Math Is Your Friend. Chapter 1 Most entrepreneurs do not go into business because they love crunching numbers and balancing the books. It is impossible to tell someone you are not speaking to personally exactly how they should price and package their offers. This is my solution to that problem. I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios with different types of products and packages that you can plug into that should help you see what you can change to get more profits out of your business, with very little additional work other than creating the offers and writing them up. Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals. There is a reason for that... Start With ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù? Chapter 2 Why is it so hard to charge the right price? If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have value. If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they can... you have verifiable value. When YOU are your product, how you value yourself has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle. Here are some things you need to consider in your mind when you figure out your value to your clients: Could they do will do for them, or as well or as fast as you could? Mindset. Chapter 3 You Actually Are Expert Enough. Chapter 3: Part 1 Most unpaid experts don‚Äôt yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you‚Äôre okay with that, right? Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it. Well... when you‚Äôre giving value to a complete stranger who you are only interacting with through websites, text, videos and other marketing materials... even socially on the interwebs... Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn‚Äôt really going to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don‚Äôt charge properly you will end up broke. If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value Look, let‚Äôs say your neighbor wants you to come help him on the computer because he‚Äôs a technoob and well, you‚Äôre awesome. But, because he‚Äôs your friend and lives next door... he doesn‚Äôt offer money, he offers to send you over some of his killer BBQ when he grills this weekend. Being Broke Helps No One. Chapter 3: Part 2 You are not going to be around to help anyone because you‚Äôre broke and depressed. But the economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET. You know... the ones who don‚Äôt want to do business with that douchebag Steve who may be as good or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn‚Äôt worth the investment. Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I‚ÄôM RIGHT. So stop arguing with me and with yourself and listen up. Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it‚Äôs the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace. I don‚Äôt want this to go to your head or anything... Why You and Not Some Other Expert? Chapter 3: Part 3 There are a ton of reasons why people will want to pay you and not someone else. I don‚Äôt want to spend a long time on this so just think about how you‚Äôve chosen one person over another simply on feeling instead of value. If you show up and do the work, you can find a way to get a piece of the market. That‚Äôs my pep talk. If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love. (Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE) Pricing and Packaging. Chapter 4 Remember, I don‚Äôt know exactly what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre offering or how good you are. If you feel like you‚Äôre not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them. Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb to follow. If you‚Äôre offering one on one consulting time or ... 10% Rule of Thumb. Chapter 4: Part 1 Take the highest price you‚Äôre comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price. Let‚Äôs talk about the different types of products and services you might offer. This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services. Any physical products could be added in as well... just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly. Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions. DON‚ÄôT BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay. *note ‚Äì correct pricing and packaging for value isn‚Äôt going to be enough if you don‚Äôt know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard for you, study the book called ‚ÄúPitch Anything‚Äù and work on that skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill. Lead With Value. Chapter 4: Part 2 First of all, I‚Äôm a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money. I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads. Do the same thing for your market. You‚Äôre reading my ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù version of that right now. I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I‚Äôm worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest. If I can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôll probably not convince you I‚Äôm worth your time anyway and that‚Äôs just not a foundation I can build on. So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do. Map a Value Ladder. Chapter 4: Part 3 The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire. You can have many different entry points into your marketing ‚Äúeco system‚Äù... it does not have to be simply linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, ‚ÄúFastest Path to Cash‚Äù let‚Äôs consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards. Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is between $6-$20. There‚Äôs so many ways you can validate that is worth more than dinner for two. It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When you look at that and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a no brainer‚Äù... You‚Äôve got a winner. Don‚Äôt Overthink It. Chapter 4: Part 4 Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It‚Äôs going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven‚Äôt seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money. So focus on this part! Pretend it‚Äôs your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this. You would tell them: ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! ‚Ä¢ Benefit! What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price. Your Core Offer. Chapter 4: Part 5 The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size. My preference is that this is scaleable, so it‚Äôs a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point. Upsells. Chapter 4: Part 6 Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you‚Äôve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want. Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it. I‚Äôll use one of my own value ladders as an example: It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market. Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It‚Äôs harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who‚Äôs focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more. TripWire Offer ‚Äì Projects in a Box Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the ‚Äúorganizationally challenged‚Äù get organized fast. $17 per template Core Offer ‚Äì My Freedom Systems - $97 Four modules in a membership site teaching people Time management, Upsell 1 ‚Äì Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free) I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that‚Äôs recorded for all members of the group. Free Optin/Lead Magnet ‚Äì 10 Ways to $10k Upsell 2 ‚Äì Business Consultation Call $299 90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what‚Äôs next in the business to increase cash and freedom. RARE UPSELL ‚Äì I offer this to less than 1% of my audience Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I‚Äôll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month. It‚Äôs not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment. Applying this to your offer. Think hard and DON‚ÄôT undervalue yourself. Okay... Here‚Äôs the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you. Did I just hear you say ‚ÄúFinally!!!!‚Äù??? I better not have! I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales. Without context, the numbers don‚Äôt mean anything. If you got to this point and skipped the rest above... Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and read it. The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through. Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers. Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them. Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage? Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is it worth? Example Scenarios. Chapter 5 Scenario One: Lowballed. Chapter 5: Part 1 Lowballed. When you‚Äôre too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes? Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $5 750 $3,750 Core Offer $20 150 $3,000 Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350 Total Revenue $10,100 Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer. Chapter 5: Part 2 Bump the Core Offer. Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it‚Äôs still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. Here‚Äôs the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS ‚Äúyes‚Äôs‚Äù to get to $10k a month. When you think about what‚Äôs harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúyes‚Äù that‚Äôs scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $10 500 $5,000 Core Offer $27 100 $2,700 Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345 Total Revenue $10,045 Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion. Chapter 5: Part 3 Bump in Price + Conversion. Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes. As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 475 $5,700 Core Offer $37 75 $2,775 Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675 Total Revenue $10,150 Scenario Four: Vip Pricing. Chapter 5: Part 4 Vip Pricing. This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN‚ÄôT IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 450 $5,400 Core Offer $37 45 $1,665 Upsell 1 $97 10 $970 Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994 Total Revenue $10,029 Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 5 Double the Upsell Price. Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 300 $3,600 Core Offer $37 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,232 Scenario Six: Tripped Up. Chapter 5: Part 6 Tripped Up. Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 275 $5,500 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 5 $985 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,162 Scenario Seven: Lower Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 7 Lower Upsell Price. Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,353 Scenario Eight: Lower Core Offer Price. Chapter 5: Part 8 Lower Core Offer Price. Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $47 45 $2,115 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,082 Scenario Nine: More Please. Chapter 5: Part 9 More Please. Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn‚Äôt that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $14,317 Scenario Ten: High Roller. Chapter 5: Part 10 High Roller. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference. Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $16,317 Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales. In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market. If you‚Äôve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more. Bottom Line.

## Quote 2

> There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.

## Quote 3

> Yep. So maybe we consider changing the branding and putting out the language. of hey you guys have seen me be doing you know this thing that thing because one thing that I am is I'm always a student I'm always a teacher I'm always a marketer and in that vein I've done these things in the past but really I'm an expert marketer and it helps you know to state who you are how are they going to know if you don't tell them yeah and and that goes back to the pedigree and the authority post of this is what I've done what you see is what I get excited about because this is social media and I'm being social talking about these things yeah what you don't know is I've done this and this and this and this and clearly this is what I'm focused on and I'm working with you know another systems at like another business growth expert who focuses primarily on systems and teams but is also amazing at market. marketing and that kind of thing so but but I think that you should always think about what are people thinking when they're looking at you and what are your the people that you you're like your ideal clients the ones that would pay the most the ones that you learn the most from the ones that you want to maybe do profit sharing with what are they thinking when they see what you're putting out there just something to think about and if it matters so to me it's a long-term leverage play to always know like what are other the high leverage people thinking when they see it yeah I also am I don't care who thinks what I'm just gonna be me and you know teach and do whatever but I do but there's wisdom that I've learned in considering those things because I have the best opportunity to serve my people when when I'm leveraged, when I'm making good money, when I'm working with very smart, high level people. So I need to make sure that they're aware that I'm out there and that they know what I'm capable of. So those opportunities come so that I keep sharpening my saw and up leveling, you know what I mean? they need to know that I'm out there and what I'm so anyway just something to think about is like who there's an audience that you serve and there's the uh not the stalkers but what are they the the lurkers. The lurkers are the high dollar payers that never say anything but DM you and say hey look I've seen you. I've been like I've got money you know I mean? They they operate very differently but I but I I want you to always think about what are the lurkers thinking when they want to.

## Quote 4

> I'm sure you know what that feels like I think we've all been in a place where whether it was money or relationships where there was something we're like, I don't need anybody to know that that's hard. Not everybody like you hopefully have somebody that talked to But so I would love and I've got time and I've got energy. would love to come up with a plan, especially knowing that you need to generate some revenue. Really, honestly, every chance we get, and we could be talking on it through Boxer, I would love to figure out. So when I'm working, now, I only have one client for the last, I don't know, eight years, who's ever been in the situation of I have to make money. Well, too, everybody else is seven and eight bigger businesses. But I have had plenty of opportunity with the two to really have to go through these exercises multiple times over. it is to figure out what your assets are, including those connections, who would, like, if you put out an offer that is, say, 500 to 1,000 or if you're going to do the DFI, mean you could get your You could do that for $5,000 for the right person and then your your month is done And you're not overburdening yourself with so much work that you can't have enough time to build the smaller offers That are easier to sell that you can sell in your sleep because you know that system really well And in the meantime, you're also sharpening your saw again and refreshing your memory on a VSL on all the market research that has to be done on the language on the system, whatever, and If you happen to be documenting your process as you go, I can't remember What thing I don't think it's descriptive something where If you if it watches your screen record, it will turn it into an SOP Which then you could use as training for the done with you or the do it yourself ESL. But I remember when Ryan Dies first did his split testing on VSLs.

## Quote 5

> No. All right. So good job, you guys. Okay. So John still wants to know what he can do to make his job a long term career that allows him to provide for his growing family. And you talked about how to become indispensable by consistently growing as a case manager, team lead. Mentor for Mary and Paralegal. I love that. That is one of my favorite things. have two kind of I don't know, M.O.'s part of my M.O. two aspects to my M.O. which would be one having unimpeachable character. That means I am the same everywhere. My feistiness, I will punch an old man in church if he's encroaching upon a young lady's face. I don't care. You can be high priest. I don't care. If you crowd a knee back off and if you don't take the signal, I have punched people. Okay. I'm a defender at all times. I'm enthusiastic all times. I love God and Jesus at all times. I sometimes swear really badly. Jesus loves me at all times. You know, but that means because I'm the same everywhere that I go that if somebody says something and it is out of alignment with my character, everybody's gonna do know that that's not true. Even if they don't like me and they don't want to defend me, they'll just be like, that's not possible because she's literally always the same person. So unimpeachable character meaning just you're just the same and you're person of quality and integrity. I sometimes I'm not the most polite I can be rude, but I'm never hurtful, I'm never vengeful, I'm never dishonest, I'm never um anything that somebody would go like those qualities, right? So that's one thing. The other thing what was the oh this I am always seeking to increase my value to those I serve. So I think everybody is technically replaceable, but that word indispensable is one that I'm always looking for. I've been a consultant for 22 years. My business is 100% what I'm mouth. I have not done any marketing and it's been a six figure business for working about 10 to 15 hours a week, by the way, since, I don't even know, it's about nine years. So, I have the people pay me a lot and in my industry, I am an anomaly. This doesn't happen. My business stands out even at like the highest level coaches. There are a few exceptions that that can do what I do, but almost nobody does. And here's why is because when I feel like, and this has happened several times, I feel like we're having the same conversations and we're just maintaining, but we're not growing. Well, my job is growth. My job is improvement. They can maintain if they get to the point where they're like, yeah, Tina, I'm doing all the things you taught me. I've got nothing else to teach them, then I don't lose that client. I don't want to, mostly because all my clients are really awesome, but also because then I've got to go replace that and I don't want to do that either. So I'm always sharpening my saw. I'm always looking for a way to be better at what I do. I'm looking at the new technologies, I'm improving my study of psychology, I'm improving my study of leadership, I'm improving my study of operations, and because I'm always growing, and also because I'm working with people who are always growing, that conversation continues to evolve and I know that they're not having that conversation anywhere else. Plus I'm paying attention to them, I'm taking notes, I'm thinking about what they're working on throughout the week. I don't just talk to them and then I don't think about them until I talk to them again the next week. And so because of that, I know because most of us don't have somebody that is really paying close attention to how well we're doing, and looking to make sure that we're doing better every week. So I know that I'm serving a very unique function for people that probably no one else is serving except for maybe their mama's. No. And so what you said is great is what are the functions that he can serve that maybe other people in the team aren't serving or what can he do best, but because we can't all do, like there are some things I just, I don't pay attention to details really well. So I do if I'm listening, but if you're going to give me a 20 page document, I'm never going to read it and I'll read half of it because I will read a paragraph and then there's my place and think a new thought and my brain just can't focus. So we've all got weaknesses, things that we don't do really well. The point is not to try to get better at the things that we don't do well. The point is to be excellent at the things that we do well because that's already in our real house and what that does is create so much lift that where our weaknesses creates drag the lift over compensates for that does that make sense uh so I love that you did that how did he respond to it um I mean he he was positive and he agreed with me which is his natural response you know that did he and this is what I want you to listen for and I also want you to tell him if he doesn't give this to you that this is what you're looking for and the conversation is not going to end until he does this which is give me an example of how you would do that what do you think about when I say that what does that look like to you open ended so he can't parent your words back to him and if he tries to parent your words back to him you say okay but that's what I say said. In your own words, what does that mean? What does that look like? And then you can just be quiet and let him sit in the awkwardness. However long it takes until he decides to not well also did you know that I think it's like two twelve is statistically across the board the least productive minute of the hour of every day and guess what our meaning is it's right around there so I won't take it personal just little bit just little bit and I'm sick did you eat oh that's not good did you eat chicken or beef I did the chicken first today so now you get to look forward to the beam all right all right all right this is last Please come and say some words. Um, so with John, there's, there's a little work to do, but I love what you're doing. I love the goals, nine cases ready for demand, 200 K and fees. So what I would like to see, I don't know if you have this next week is, and this may take some time in my brain literally can't even picture the start of it because generally when I want something like this, I will create a foundation. But I would love to see team steps, um, with all the cases that you have, who's working on what on a spreadsheet and then what that equates to monetarily so that we can track that improvement so that we can track your performance, your leadership performance. Obviously, we're going to have the big number at the end, which is what are the gross to. but if we break it down by how each individual set of goals impacted that bottom line number, then you'll be able to have an even bigger impact to that bottom line number, because now you know what the little levers are, right? specific goals by what specific people was able to create that lift?

> Um, and now he just, he almost never has that energy. And when he does, he automatically is like, yeah. But this is what's good, and this is what's good, and this is what's good, and I'm like that's my boy right there So It's all it's all the process anyway. Oh crap the time. Geez Okay So I want you to start thinking more about how do you get more of your most profitable activity or More out of your most profitable activity. So you're not necessarily trying to spend more time doing it But trying to milk what you can out of it sometimes it's more time and then How we can support that the other work activities? This is where time tracking comes in we want to figure out what we can delegate and so if you look at it and go These are things also. What is not getting done? That should be done. Go ahead and put that down there and we'll highlight that in a different way Things that you know should be happening in your business, but isn't we want that list And then step two, oh, you did, no, I knew you didn't. Okay, yeah, step two. I really want you to fill out step two because what that is is things that energize you, things that drain you. it ranks how good you are at stuff. So that helps with delegation, but it also helps us figure out where's the sharpening of the saw activities that we need to do. And even if we're only putting a little bit of saw sharpening activities monthly, right? The pace is gonna be dictated by you and what you wanna do. But categorizing the things that you do across profitability and then energy and then skill really helps us rank where the time goes so that we can get the most out of it and also how we can utilize other people to get the most out of your existing team and assets and kind of future pace and figure out What would come next in order to get you to more of the profitable either activities or higher leverage profitable activities? Yep, I like that plan Okay All right, so I will send you some notes and In a few minutes because otherwise I might forget and I don't want to do that And then I will talk to you Monday cool.

## Quote 7

> So I don't think we're at 2008 now, but it started in 2006. People really have focused on 2008, but it started happening in 2006. If I recall correctly, going through all of that, it was shifting then. Anyway, so always be thinking leveraged, and the most leveraged thing that I think that you can do is be a high-paid consultant. Now, why that's leveraged is how much time you spend doing it. You have enough connections, but here's the other thing is, you're in a situation where almost everybody is not highly leveraged, and that's the issue. don't have the kind of money to make you a highly paid consultant. So the way that you could be leveraged is having somebody that you can actually use, who is not as smart as you, might be very good and should be very skilled, but not as smart as you and aware as you in terms of being leveraged. So a lot of the contractors are not making, probably not going to be making the money that they were, because the people they were working for are losing money kind of a fist because they don't manage their business as well, and they don't manage their money well. There is going to be a shortage of client work for those middle level people who are really good at what they do, but who don't have a marketing engine to get them new clients and who are losing clients because their clients can't be. So what I think that, and this is going to be like we've talked about rolling up your sleeves, and you've been there for a while, but It feels different when you have somebody else to riff with and to work with. I think what you should be figuring out is, and to me, I think Chris, one of your most powerful and valuable skills is offer creation. The hook and the offer is high level strategy, but then most people don't have the fulfillment team to write that copy, write the email, write the sales pages, write the follow-up sequences, and that actually is not as valuable, but it is necessary to offer creation. Most people don't have the brain for the offer creation that can write copy pretty well. Okay, and they don't have the co-honies to say, hey, this is what you should be doing, and here's why, and they won't do to do the math, but they can write the persuasive copy. So what I think that you should do, and this will take a little bit of time because you gotta find the right person, but I think that you should focus on a consulting gig that makes you a minimum of $100 to $150 per hour, effective hourly rate based off your number, and that might change after you go plug everything in. And then what you do is you price it accordingly, and then you go hire a copywriter to help create your vision that you copy chief, again, trying to focus on that effective hourly rate, being an increase of what you've already been doing. So that way mentally you're like, yes, I'm working more, but I have raised my value and I can see it. So that level of satisfaction, and basically what you're doing is removing that friction and that resistance that's been stressing you out of I could be doing better. because now you know you are doing better. Does that make sense? Yeah. So I know you got to go, but what I want you to do, and let's revisit this. Again, we don't have to wait until we meet. can have these conversations, okay? Look for some consulting jobs where they need help with offer creation and leveraging their business so that they're not bleeding money and they're getting the most out of what they already have, right? Repurposing things, improving their offers, their leverage. Nobody's talking about leverage, really, you know that. But that's the saving grace for us in these hard times, is leverage. So create leverage, and then you go leverage somebody else's writing skills and ability, or even chat GPT and train it well, but focus on leverage because that's the thing that's going to keep you, especially in this third month. people from stressing out. We need to talk more. You've got a lot on your plate. Use me. This is my genius zone and I want to use it for you. I don't want the third month to be stressful for you. There's no need for it. You've got too much value and too much that you bring to the table to ever feel that again, no matter what the economy is. Okay.

## Quote 8

> I was like, wow, they had a VIP level. And this is because this this thing right here, I'm going to highlight it in yellow. This is their seems to be their new focus is building this community. This is this is on Um, mighty networks, okay, $39 per month. And I imagine, you know, that's, this could be a play that, and John mentioned this on our first call, it's called grow and transform. Um, getting more people into this would be freaking child's play with a proper email. Um, So this could be the guts of what we suggest for them as a focus. Um, So, so that's, that's, that's a potential direction. Now, just to give you a picture of, of their business model, they kind of have two paths or two buckets. And these are absolutely not clear on their website either. Uh, because there's a lot of confusing crime. crossover. But they have the RTT therapy and personal development. And here they give away some regifts. Here's the landing pages to get a therapy partner. So so Marissa does not do therapy calls. She has a team of therapists that are trained. And people book calls just like they would from any therapists. So there's that. This, if I had to guess, is a small percentage of their revenue. Because they're therapists, we don't know because they haven't asked those questions per se, the career, the career path where they become a therapist and are allowed to offer RTT to their, to their clients. That's the 15. This is the $15,000 high ticket thing. think this is probably 95% of their revenue.

## Quote 9

> So an evergreen thing that runs that sells this $39 a month deal to where they don't have to do this is the first time they ever did the reinvent yourself summit that's a brand new thing. I have no idea how it produced. And a lot, I watched probably 10 of those sessions released the replay and most of them were recorded previously, which is a big undertaking, but now they have an asset that they can use. just, my opinion would be, this is incongruent with RTT because it's a bunch of random value that is not going deeper with their unique ability. So Marissa showed up and she did, she was, I think on three of the days, she was the first segment where she led them through a meditation or a sorry, I keep calling a meditation hypnosis, which great, but to me, they're running somebody else's playbook here. which is incongruent with this offer. So what we would do for them, essentially, this would be what I would look at, is I would go to their, let me share a second. I'm sure my browser. Here's a re-event yourself summit. Lander. They had some ballers in here. Jim Wick. John Asiraf, James Altucher, Pace Morvey's huge. He's a $600 million guy. But he's real estate. And then, anyway, this is a very, very random sampling, which I think is good five years ago. I don't think summits convert very well. And I could be wrong, but if I had to guess, I would say this didn't exceed their expectations. Here are landing pages. This is a landing page for free gift that is for somebody who doesn't know what path they want to go on. Here are an example of four gifts that they give away for free. So you click on this and you fill out your name, for each of these. So potentially, we could take one experience from this bucket. This is the this is the heal your self personal development bucket. This is the I am enough meditation. She has a book called I am enough. This could be a big one because that could also support the book. So my questions to them would be which of these produce the most revenue. And then we would take this automation or sorry this hypnosis and automate a four or five day email based experience for this. And also do the same thing for their free gifts. Let me see where that was the free gift. Okay, here's the opt in for the training courses, which is essentially just a prospectus that or a guide that it can opt in for. But we can take either their prospectus or their guide and then turn that into an experience that's delivered over time so that people can determine if being a therapist is right for them. So that being said, that right now they're pulling, based on our previous conversation, they're pulling a lot of their therapists from those who go through the personal development track and they say, hey, this would be really fun to make money with. And so there's a bridge that goes from the personal development track to the certified therapist track. And that is, is this right for me? My, my sister-in-law is a, she's a fangirl of Marissa. to like hardcore fan girl. This is almost all she can talk about. It's wild. And she's the kind of know it all girl that, you know, she has a solution to everything that yells you. And she's been considering this, but she's still on the fence. So it's an interesting ecosystem. They have, here's their book of call, which is literally just a book of call. this apply now just goes to their certificate or their $4,500 course for their, they call it certification. So is only $4,500 and they have a $15,000 like business in a box version of that. based on what I understand. Anyway, here is the shop just to get a real quick overview. They sell bundles of hypnosis audios. And each one of these kind of has its own little bucket. It is very unclear which of these does the best other than best seller bundle. And then here they categorize these based on the buckets that they serve love and relationship, health, overcoming addictions, personal development, wealth and success, weight management. And these trainings are our courses. So there's also these other foundation certificate for hypnotherapy. um, foundation certificate for rapid transformational therapy, I guess you can get started for 240 bucks. Um, confident coach, certificate and applied and this is the one videos. They have trainings and then they have a certification and then a business and a box $15,000 thing. Uh, sold via phone call and live events, most likely. And also have a couple of webinars. I didn't mention that. Um, I don't really want to touch a webinar, but, uh, they have one. So it seems to me like the, the better questions would be which one makes them the most money. Um, is $39 a month, their current focus, if it is, why don't we turn their current assets into an automated evergreen experience that upsells people into the $39 month thing at a very, very high rate. At $39 a month, based on their current price points of their hypnosis audios and people going through the hypnosis, conversion rates gonna be really, really good. I wouldn't be shocked to have 15, 20, 30% in terms of immersion. So, this to me would be, I think we can be reasonable in our... communication of expectations. But to me, this would be a home run. I can't imagine not hitting a home run with this. This is right in my house.

## Quote 10

> So generally, the approach is going to be group wise. The support and the so there's also the coach in private praise and public type of thing. So, for example, let's say you have team meeting and somebody says something that is too critical, right? It's not constructive feedback. First of all, you also want to, you don't just want to tell people hey, you're safe and you can say whatever you want to and nobody's going to say anything because that's safe without a purpose. goal is that we also want to make ourselves those people who can accept constructive feedback. So part of the culture and the values need to be, I'm a person who wants to grow and I want to be the best version of myself. So that's actually where you start is asking and trying to figure out like, how do you feel about personal development? How do you feel about, you know, do you have goals to improve yourself professionally, personally, as the communicator, as a team member, as a person, as a parent, as whatever. Because if that value doesn't exist, all of these efforts are moved. They will placate and patronize, but it will be ineffective. This has to be an intrinsic motivation to want to be better. For the most part, I think that sweet law does a good job of attracting those types of people. There are exceptions, and you can tell that those are the people that basically show up for a paycheck. And there's not a lot that you can do with that except for just create strong guardrails basically. So that they know, you know, if you're here for the paycheck, this is what you got to do to get the paycheck. But just so you know, our culture is we're here to be the best that we can be as teams, but also as individuals. And so if you want to enjoy being here, if you want to stay here a long time, then, you know, consider getting on board with these goals and these values. And here's why you might want to do it. Here's here's the reward for it. at the end of the day, there are people who are intrinsically motivated and driven and there are people who are not there only externally driven. Those really aren't very common, honestly. people have intrinsic drive, but they don't necessarily, first of all, even have a consciousness of it. They don't know what their own motivators are. They've never contemplated it. They don't have anybody mentoring them and guiding them. So, it starts with the conversations and just awareness. And from that sparks questions, which return answers, which generally spark additional questions deeper. And it's a series of just probing, gathering information, analyzing the information, adjusting the trajectory and where you're going based on that information. And then probing again, and it's an iterative process ongoing. but those are the types of conversations that will lead to most of it and it starts with kind of assessing who do you have on the team and what drives them. Let me this creating a safe space for VRE. So you have me go back to, let me switch my create one for just you and yep that'll be sweet. So I have a tab manager and I have different sets of tabs for each of my clients. So they automatically opens up all the things that I'm working in.

## Quote 11

> that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.

## Quote 12

> So no, I had like four or five. That was the original. And then I realized that there's, um, there's the next level stuff. So like the sharpen your saw and like mind your heart, those two last ones. They are like, how do you feed the visionary? How do you keep that person, um, up with everything, sharpening your shawl, whatever you're the best at, you have to keep doing it. You do it normally and naturally, but basically it's the shield against apathy and complacency. And then the mind's your heart or yeah, mind's your heart. So that's about heart and mind. It's that we're human beings. Um, and if you don't constantly feed yourself with positive information that strengthens you, that encourages you. urges you that uplifts you when it's a fan because it will, when you lose a spouse, when you lose a child, when you lose some function in your body, when you lose a parent, whatever, whatever happens when we go through a recession, something's going to happen to you. If you haven't intentionally been fortifying yourself on a daily basis, on a steady basis, when that comes, it's going to crush you. So that's something that is a part of my process, right? We do it in our coaching sessions and things like that. But it's not, you know, technically the business stuff, but it 100% is a strategy. It's an intentional strategy. It's a regular part of my practice. And so it got added into it. And yeah, anyway, so that's how it came about. So with Visa, I would just say, what are the things you always teach people? And I would show her how to use chat TBT and a Google Doc, and just go like, what are the things like, tell me some of the stories? Well, in those stories, we're going to extract a concept and she could start by telling chat GPT stories and then go okay what is the premise what is the concept that I taught and I could teach her how to do those things and then now she's got something that she can be working with if it's three o'clock in the morning and she can't sleep and she's like these things are on her mind but you don't want to go call somebody because everybody else is sleeping because they're saying they're not really um you know what I mean so that could be I could teach her those things because that's what I've been doing with this is using chat GPT telling it stories and then having it give me some like extraction like what did you notice I'm like oh yeah that's what I do and then I go write something what yeah yeah so anyway okay so sorry that was just there no even clear ending point I've got lots of questions for you and I've already taken a letter of time so I'll wait till next week but also thank you for being

> Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.

## Quote 14

> A compartmentalizing and keeping her in a job role that works for her. It's not a bad thing when people have employee mindsets. Where would we be without those people who are like, you just want to show up and do the job and then want to go home? I don't want to own the business, don't want all that responsibility. Those are the people that show up and run our businesses without taking it away from us and selling it to the highest bidder. We need those people badly, but you really need to know who they are and you need to, like you say, show up for them and ask of them only what really they can handle well. What we want to do is the same reason people get and stay in bad relationships is because it's comfortable and it's there. It's what in front of you, and it's a lot of work breaking somebody else in, but that is not the way to excellence, that's not the way to growth, that's not the way to even being happy in the end, no matter what it is, even if it's a professional relationship. Yeah, so, you know, there's been, you may have grown out of the relationship you had with Mary, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a place, but I mean your perspective of what she was to you, is to you, whatever your right hand, which Dan and I would both disagree with, but we both know we're not there every day. I don't know if Salka would disagree, but Salka would disagree, he's probably just probably disagreeing no matter what.

So, this is total close, and this is resolved. So, this is probably paid, and this is, we came to. It got settled. Resolution's probably settled. All right. That proportion is correct. That's interesting. This disparity is pretty big. It's not a month roughly, not quite a month, but then. The speed to act. actually closed. Now it's only really a week difference. Anyway, these are the targets. So this is last 90 days. Let's do the first quarter. Or for the gimme, let's see, equals last quarter is roughly the last 90 days. I don't want that. We'll just do this here. I feel like that number was higher, so, too many one. All right, Lorenz, keep track of your number and Sam's number, 319, 291, Patrick, keep track of your number. Even though we know that that's skewed and Tyler's number 301. So I'm gonna switch it back to 90 days real quick It's got it Yeah That's weird I would not expect that to go up, but it did for everybody I think In the last 90 days, I wonder how that report pulls data Hmm any thoughts guys Maybe like increasing cases Yeah, that's a significant jump though, so for Lorenz it was 346 versus what? three twenty three nineteen three nineteen so twenty seven days so less than a month but still that's a month and then Samantha's number change to you remember what her the number one I feel like it was like 200 something yeah hers was like two ninety something okay and then Tyler let's go switch that back again one more time and it was this year so let's everything up till now so three nineteen yep and then hers was two ninety one so she's roughly 20 day difference higher which is about what yours is right friends yeah and then Tyler's what was Tyler's is he's went down No, that should probably do. It's just an easy, different window side by side. Real one, watch out, 281. Okay, yeah, so here's one up. Here's one. Oh yeah, he did the opposite. So this actually went down. This is 90 days. Well, and where's the volume?
