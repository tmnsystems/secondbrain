## Quote 1

> Don't let that ABT replace me because I'm better, but you know, but you can do it. It can it can probe and do something. And matter of fact, the way that my copy evolved was that and it was crazy because. So I went through and I was making a lead magnet for. Principles and priorities. And I had just told it the importance of. That the reason it's, it's the first. concept in the first pillar that I teach is because values, principles and values, they inform priority and priority informs what gets done and what gets measured. And that obviously is going to inform what we actually have and so then it goes through and it goes the secret way to like how I'm going to go read it. I'm just going to do this normal wrap up. Someone is just crazy. Tick tock marketing strategies is where we ended up writing this I think. I gave it bunch of notes after that. going Oh, you know what actually I sent it to some of that. But it was, yeah, no, I really, I do really want to tell you this show this. I had to scroll up past the billions of conversations that we have. Okay, it was after our ball of reality. never mind. I'm just priority. So no one cares. That's how I can find it because I told it no one cares. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. Okay, so it wrote this. It said title, the surprising key to unlocking your business potential, how core values transform your priorities. And I was like, nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's not good at all. What people care about is actually getting traction and momentum in their business and they feel stuck. I'm pretty sure you have enough understanding about human emotion to be able to write better than this. What questions do you need to ask yourself? People are writing to make sure that you are writing something that will evoke powerful emotion So it asked the questions six of them. What are the primary pain points of my audience? Then it asked another question, and then what emotions are tied to the pain point? What transformation are they seeking? What's the immediate benefit they will gain from my solution? How can I create urgency in the sense of importance? What proof of credibility can I provide and then? The new copy it did not ask you questions. It did not answer it It answered itself and then wrote the copy without any further interaction for me The new title unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack Introduction feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks announcing progress. You're not alone Most business owners struggle with the same issues feeling like they're spinning their rails without getting any traction The good news is there's a simple yet powerful solution that can change everything in just minutes So I have taught it that stuff but it doesn't matter because in the past I taught it so many things and it won't pull from it and it won't take the psychology that I had taught it and it didn't put it into copy like it just it took so much training and this I like what I just told you like nobody cares blah blah whatever I would go 20 rounds and still not get anything great but what it did right there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve word headline unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack um I will read the rest of that next is feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks oh mama keep reading you know what I mean mm-hmm so um but where it started where is it started like unlocking your priorities give her a brat there else I'm out there

## Quote 2

> And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.

## Quote 3

> Oh, yes, I know that. Yeah. So he has done this great presentation, and you might have seen it because lots of people. We'll have done it, but it's you have a jar and next to the jar are sand and rocks, pebbles and bigger rocks and water. And he says, can you fit all of this into the jar? And people try to do it and it doesn't work, it won't all fit. But then he starts with a fresh jar and he puts in the big rocks first and then he puts in the smaller rocks and then he puts in the sand and then he puts in the water and everything fits in the jar. And so he said the only way that you can get everything in is by starting with the big rocks first. So that's where terminology and a lot of business stuff has come up with big rocks and it's what matters most is what you start with because even at the end of the day, let's say some of the stuff doesn't get into the jar, you got what matters most. So you kind of decide through a series of priorities, principles, values, and whatnot. of evaluating what it is that you're doing. So what are the big rocks for each business? What are the big rocks for you as a person? What are the big rocks for you as a father? And we do have some homework to come back to you with the family values.

## Quote 4

> Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.

## Quote 5

> And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.

## Quote 6

> I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.

## Quote 7

> Well, and my faith believes that he was resurrected resurrected like with a physical body and that we were all spirits before we came here and that we receive our bodies and that we will be resurrected and we see them back again, but they will be changed and unable to die unable to be corrupted and What we know about science that makes perfect sense to me that there's the ability to figure that out, you know Anyway, it's all fascinating to me, but yeah, yeah, so We spent so much time on that. really want to know that I mean, I don't regret that. I just want to make sure that we also do But it's anyway, it's part of journey we do that we do Mercer's course. Yeah, yes, yes. But this is the thing, though, is that I've really been able to I've been leaning more into the whole list approach because the business is nothing without the solidity of the CEO behind it, the visionary behind it, the the person and all of those values. Like I think about Mark, I think about everyone's evolution that I've ever worked with. And the biggest transformation happened with the person, then then their business, the business had a correlating transformation. But 100% every time the person had the bigger transformation. Like when you think about who you work with, how much time has been working with them, the way that you handle them, but also like your sleep, your hormone health, your physical health, I did I'm not the one that did all of that, but you've been on this journey, we discuss it, and then you go and do different things. But just being an assistant or facilitator or whatever it is to that process, and knowing that the systems, the teams, all those processes are critical, they're the simplest part of it. They're really easy to do. The first thing is kind of editing, modifying the person that's running it so that their prime is to be able to understand the power, the need for not only creating the infrastructure, you know, in the particular way, in the logical way, which to me also is part of my mission. What I don't to out of people's lives. I feel like that's kind of preparing them for when they're ready to talk to God, when they're ready to have him in their life, because they now recognize people that lie. They now recognize chaos. They now recognize darkness a little bit differently. And that's not the conversations we have, but it happens. They become happier people, but they put more order in their lives. They put more goodness in their lives. They put more integrity in their lives and in their business. Anyway, it's just been wild. The things that you happen, you're like, it's wild, but of course, I've been having so much of that, the people that marks into me. I was just like, I want different clients. And I was like, do you have anybody? And then he sent me somebody and that guy was awesome. And then there's, he's talking about another person that as I'm working with the new doctor and just, Working on the mission talking to you all the things that you're going through. I'm just like it's just it just keeps getting better Faster, but also like right Darker on the other side. You know what I mean? Like the polarity. It's wild. Anyway, okay. Yes. Marshall Mercer Mercer Where are we happening? Huh?

## Quote 8

> Teamwork and prioritization. So this was the thing I was going to come back to you on this cat and we talked about it last week and Lauren, you and I talked about it, which is now looking at all the things that have to get done each week. There's a standard operating procedure, right? Every case needs to be worked out. There are certain things that have to be done. But when it comes to priority, some cases are worth more than others. Some are have more work to do in them. Every client is important, right? case matters. neglecting any is not an option. But that doesn't mean that we can't sort of triage and prioritize according to what's most valuable. And I'll give you perspective on this. Again, taking into account that at neglect is not optional, not acceptable. So we're not talking about not taking care of somebody because they're not valuable enough. That's not what we're talking about. But like Patrick, we were talking about when you do incentive pay, one of the things that you're talking about is making sure that everybody knows that they're equally valuable and you thinking about using incentive pay to show that. But what I explained to you and I'll tell you, Lauren, I know you know this but just something to think about is that when it comes to how you show up in your job, you're not the same because you've invested in a law degree, you've invested the time in that, you've invested the money in that. on top of that, you have liability on you. You can get sued, they can't get sued. So there is a real priority. station slash kind of ranking in in hierarchy, if you want to call it in kind of in everything in life. Now, abuse of the hierarchy can get us into trouble, right? But not acknowledging it can as well. So at the end of the day, sweet law is a business. And what is the main objective of what your values are, how you treat people inside of that, that's culture, that's important. But at the end of the day, there is no business if it's not profitable. And making sure that we have the ability to pay everybody, pay everybody well, so that, you know, we've got lawyers here, like if there aren't attorneys, we can't help anybody, right? If there aren't good legal assistance, we can't help any of their good case managers, we can't help anybody, or we can't help them best. So, profit matters and just thinking about that. Again, neglect is not not negligible and not optional. So, just ranking, looking at things, how do you and how do your teams think about what has to get done every morning? Who determines priority for their tasks? Do you prioritize your day? Do you get it and you say, okay, here's my plan for the day, and here's why it's going to go down this way.

## Quote 9

> Really, just good communication, if it's last second, it's not going to matter. But I would expect the same from you if I'm like last second on my daughter's having an issue, I need to go do this. So, but that is part of the things that I learned to do in business too, is make sure that the people that I work with on a regular basis, so like customers or patients wouldn't necessarily be the same thing, partners and anybody that you have like a consistent kind of energy exchange, you want to have at least compatible values. They don't have to be the same, but they have to be compatible so that the things that are important to you, you never feel like you have to apologize for. And likewise, that's a gift that you get to give to somebody else that reciprocity, right? that they know that they're safe with you and comfortable with you and I was one of the most liberating things that I ever did was change that in my practice and let's see how long has it been? I would say probably nine years and I've been doing this for 22 years, um really more aggressively. I mean honestly I fired, I fired my main client that I'd had for nine years last year so it's uh everything is iterative line-up online kind of kind of type of thing where you you we grow in degrees I guess it would be an even better way like you think about the way that the sun comes up and the illumination of the earth it is um by degrees literally degrees right? It comes up and you know that it's coming up and you can tell that it's coming up and you can at more light and you can feel that warmth like all of those things that the sun gives increases just slowly and so we grow the same way and it's important to keep that in mind because you can't rush the sun we can't really rush our growth either you can't skip a step it can't go from here to here it has to do the whole gamut so anyway uh these things okay so long version of glad we could be scheduled welcome to adac right anyway so i did review your sleep journal and um and your journal journal which my writing is pretty bad so i'm not judging but it was a little difficult i was like let's just say and i think i deciphered most of it but um let me move this over here so i can see i've written the journal like the same way i mean i started writing a journal when i was about six six or seven years old when i

## Quote 10

> Oh yes, thank you. That's how little I've been in it. I really wanted to be prepared and have things organized for you, but this is the thing. I'm starting to get to a point where, oh, I could stop my video. Sorry. uh where I can't do things by myself so much so I'm a business consultant and what I do for to earn my money for the most part is um I get on meetings with clients who pay me really well and I help them with their systems and their teams and their operations and their mindset and all kinds of things I take a really holistic approach to business so um I've been doing that for 22 years but um and everything I've done has been 100% word of mouth and I get paid really really well and it's been amazing and it's been a blessing um and I've been raising four children by myself for that same amount of time but now I in this background is relevant so that you understand just kind of like um a little bit about me and understand where um you know what you could offer what how you might be helpful and because I would really like, I think there's a potential for a great long term arrangement. But I think that it's helpful to understand the background. So two of my daughters are fully grown now and I've got a 17 year old and a 14 year old. And so I needed a lot less and the reason I chose the work that I did and the reason I got good at what I got good at was because I needed work to be very efficient. I needed business to be very efficient so that I had plenty of time to be mom. And because I got good at that, I was able to train it to other people and that's what they came you up for. But I only worked about 10 hours a week. And I mean, that's how good of a business it is that even in 10 hours a week, I could still take really good care of my family. So I'm good at what I do. But I need to work more because I'm a mama at heart. and without little kids at home to take care of, I really want to put it into business right now. And so I want to help more people, but because my business has always been 100% word of mouth, I can't just grow it. I don't have a marketing engine for it at all. I've never run ads for it, I've never needed to. And I've never had, I've never launched a course, but I really felt called because my approach is so different. You know, I'm not about the hustle and grind. I'm not about, you know, make as much money as you can, just because you can. It's really about using business to help you have a full fulfilling and happy life. And that looks different for everybody. Everybody's brains are different. Everybody's skills are different. Their finances are different. Their family time is different. You know what I mean? All these different things. And so I'm able to teach people. how to build there and optimize their business based on their own values and their own resources and things like that. So there's a couple things going on. One of the things is I'm working on building that course. I'm having somebody help kind of extract information for me. I'm using AI to help me just organize and take all of the stuff that I've been doing on repeat for 22 years. And productizing it so that I can offer it to people who can't afford $500 to $1,000 an hour to work with me. So that's part of it. And then the other thing is though I would like to also build a system that can help me find the higher level clients that I have and they are going to be know multi seven figure earners. I've got doctors, I've got lawyers, I've got market I've got copywriters, I've got, I've had property managers, I have lots of different types of people. So working on all of that and inside of that, because I've been working on building businesses with other people, and also because when I first got started, it wasn't as a consultant, it was, I did web design, I did graphic design, I did copywriting, I customized WordPress, I customized PHP scripts, I built automations, so I have a lot of the, I know that there's a lot of great things that we can do just to kind of build a really good engine and machine using technology, and I want to leverage all of that. But I don't want to be the one doing the work and thinking about that, I want to stay in my own lane of helping the business people do their job well. So when you said automations make your brain light up, That's awesome. That's so fun. And maybe it'll be something where you'll look at things and go, oh, I see we're doing it this way, you know, have you thought about doing this or incorporating that? And not necessarily immediately, but just thinking about what I would love is if I give you a task, if you have a thought about it, like I think, you know, have you thought about doing it that way, right? I think maybe this would be better or this is a potential problem I see.

## Quote 11

> Okay, because what I would like to see is basically anything that you have that you track any of your business. So what would be really helpful is, okay, this is the record, anything that you can do to give me a full understanding of why you do it, why you do it this way, what it tracks, how long you've been tracking it, that type of thing. That honestly, if that was all that we accomplished over the next couple of weeks is transferring that data so I could start kind of wrapping my head around it so that I can formulate the best questions. But here's the thing I want you to always think about when you're planning out your day, when you're planning out your week, when you're planning out your month, when you're planning out your quarter, and I don't even know if you think about it in terms of quarterly goals and things like that, that would have been my guess. Which is okay, we're just really getting track to like you're just very brand new on your own, you know, I never. used to think like that. It's really only been probably the last 10 years that I've been working that way and I could improve a lot and I do the quotes because so for example I have Mark and I think I told you to read Emith. lot of these business type books assume values that I have that I don't have and then I never will have. For example Mark's value is if I want to go in the office for month I'm not going to go into the office for a month. Now almost anybody who's a business consultant is going to say you're insane that's stupid you can't run a business like that. I would not because I would say you're not going to run the best business that way. There's going to be a lot that's going to suffer that way but there's trade-offs. If you have enough leaders in the business it's profitable. Your people are happy and your highest value is the freedom. to do what you want to with your time, I think you created the perfect thing. And business books and business courses don't approach things like that. They will give you that judge you kind of like, well, you could do better. You could hire someone, you could do this. Yeah, it's, but everything comes with more stress, every person that you hire, it's more stressed, it's more responsibility, it's more expectations. And we've already talked about how failure to mean expectations is where most stress and anxiety comes from. The more people you involve, and the more, you know, you're like, these are our goals, this is what we're doing, the more you have expectations that you have to meet. So if your higher value is flexibility, and fluidity in life, so that you can be a free agent across the board, then the trade-offs are going to be, you're going to lose some of the structure, and you're going to lose some of the benefit of the structure and momentum, but you're going to maintain that autonomy. and that freedom throughout your life. So you're leveraging everything as much as you can, not for the sake of revenue. Revenue is feeding the autonomy. Revenue is the secondary thing. The autonomy and the freedom is the first thing, which is generally who I'm working with, because yeah, I could do all of that, I don't want to. I don't either. I could have been a valedictorian and I'm like, that's way too much effort. I don't want to study. I will, whatever I accumulate during the class, that's it. I still graduated with honors, but I did zero homework. Zero studying. I'm just like, why? I'd rather play soccer. rather do this. I'd rather do that. I'd rather go, yeah. cheerleader and football and track and softball and tennis. Is that everything?

Like, I'm just going to tell her to hire someone for $50 to recreate it in System I owe because I was trying to do it a little bit on the weekend, but learning new technology, even though I like System I owe, I think it's really good. And there's another woman that that big Facebook group that that that that lady runs digital wealth, whatever, she teaches them System I owe as well. She's got a really a business model. Do you want me to do this? Give it to you in a nutshell. know we're supposed to do this for nine. Okay, so $47 I'm in the thing and she's teaching a lot about social media, building organic growth, but very, very emotionally positive mindset stuff in there, which I think is really good for lot of people. Like it's almost like this is kind of maybe the end result what we want. So I'm like, holy cow, this is good. But what she does is anyone who buys, she has a regular opt-in how to make money online, start a business online webinar, and then sells her courses, which she whitelables to you. So for $900 at the end of the web or if you buy it, you get her whole funnels and Kooloo Testimals everything and the ability to resell her stuff. And the training is really in-depth about how to take it inside. System IO is the choice that they use because it can have the whole course in there and everything. And there's crazy amount of testimonials that people Then all she needs to teach someone, because think about it, she's simplified, starting on business from the complex to just simple, where you're just focusing on branding and traffic, social organic traffic, you could use ads too. And you don't have to now worry about delivery, because you have a proven product that's actually high values. It's not crap. know, like some other people sell licensing stuff too. And then if one chooses to then create their own digital products, they've already then locked in, locked in, how to do traffic and have a personal brand and the list, your own list.

## Quote 13

> Not because I'm lazy but because I despise waste and I have finite energy and only 24 hours a day and only a handful of those really spent on what matters to me. I want an amazing life and I figured out how to create that for myself. Along the way I figured out how to help people who have totally different values and mental processes do the same. The exercise you're about to go through has been life-changing for so many. It is deceptively simple. It looks like an ordinary spreadsheet but and I need you to really hear me on this. Pretend that the spreadsheet is like Clark Kent. It only looks like a nerdy news reporter but in real life it's a superhero. I first had people go through this exercise 12 years ago under another program called My Freedom Systems. I have been delighted to learn that this exercise alone own was deemed worth the price of my full course at that time. And not only that, but 12 years later, these principles are still just as useful and valuable in helping people make the most amount of money with the least amount of time and stress. I'll give you two other examples of how this exercise impacted two very different people. One, a voice coach and a musician who hated numbers and all things administrative. By the way, I have yet to meet a business owner who liked the advent and stuff, but she trusted me and so she did the exercise. When she finally finished the work, she immediately saw how she could reach her goals exponentially faster. I'll link her testimony below if you want to hear from her. She wanted to buy a ranch to foster children and teach music and she got there three years early. In fact, I just got the sweetest message from her on my birthday, a video of her on a ranch inviting me to come visit. When I tell you I'm different, but I can get two results.

## Quote 14

> I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?

## Quote 15

> So that's really limited. I can't have a lot of that. Then there's the give back. There's the people. I just want to help all the moms. I want to help the dads too, but especially the moms. the moms are gonna go help the dads. moms are gonna help the brothers. It's like, then they're gonna be taken care of if I take care of the women. 100%. But I want to be able to help them. And that is not a very profitable thing in the offers that I'm thinking about doing because they can't pay as high level. My earnings per hour to start with, like if the number gets bigger, but then I have to hire more people and manage because the more important thing to me is really serving that community very well. So the margins are going to be much smaller. They should still be good, but much smaller. a lot more group effort and but it's a completely different level of fulfillment, a different level of I'm going to say the same things over and over and over and over and over again, which I kind of do anyway, because fundamental concepts, right? But I'm going to say the real big stick things over and over again. And so that doesn't satisfy my big brain efforts, right? The one is like, let me think about all the fun exciting new things, let me learn, let me explore. And on top of that, I'm also serving my mission on top of that, I'm in school for my psychology degree. So, which sounds like a lot and compared to how it's been for the last several years, but I was bored in languishing and I didn't know that. But with those are the compartments. And so when I'm looking at everybody, unless it's, well, even the doctors and attorneys, the entrepreneur visionary ones that reach out to me, they love marketing. They love automations. They love leverage. So I'm working with people who are also, no matter what they're doing, they're not the average type. They have different levels of fulfillment that needs to happen. So all of us need something that has staying power that has the compounding. It's the steady rock, right? So it's got a community. You've got followers. You've got a constant message that really just doesn't change. It's a fundamental message. It's a fundamental thing for you. think it's copy and marketing or maybe even just direct response itself, which is getting people to respond to you based off of what you're doing. But there's also just kind of business. I would really put you more in the marketing realm of what gets excited because of what you go back to most. is offers and serving the the market. So, but you're also interested in business and you're interested in freedom and you're interested in self-providence and you're interested in sustainability and you're interested in people working for their own values not for some arbitrary amount of dollars, not for shiny objects because you want to keep up with the Joneses, right? So, you're the, we talked about this before like average Joe, but the not average, like it's not average. It's think that, so when I'm talking to you about me, to change things. What I think it is is that, and I also know that when we get clearer on what we want, that's when it comes to us, right? Because you can set a really clear attention. Your conversation starts to change who you pay attention to and want to even converse with changes because you've made this switch in your mind and made a decision. This is what I want to attract. So there are two paths that I think that you could consider, and one is, potentially three, one is a consulting gig that is a profit sharing performance-based incentive that is decided from the beginning, so you're not arguing about it. it could be relatively small, feel better not be having a hot flash going on. Okay, then pause is awesome. Anyway, so it isn't about necessarily how big the percentage is, but it's that that there is a growth opportunity, right? Because then the onus is on you is to leverage that. And you can potentially either reinvest some of your earnings into somebody that so you're barely touching it. And that's an engine because it's an engine for you because you brought it because it will keep making money and then you have a person that helps you with it. Like I've been telling you I want you for sure to be using other people's time and talent a little bit more, but first we've got to get you to the money where you can really do that. So that's one version of it. Another one is a you know a profit sharing partnership, but not with somebody old. this is not an ageist thing because some people can be really old and just really just like they're they're still at it there's there's all kind of things but I mean like old in their heart just like right you know like it without fire let's let's put it with that somebody who has fire in them for the stuff that they're doing and maybe they hate marketing but they love their products love the market love but but don't love marketing you know there are lots of those people they're really good at fulfillment and they may be good at marketing but they hate it and they or they also have come to the realization that they're splitting their time doing something that they're not efficient at and can make so much more money so that is the thing I really think that you should be kind of super powering your magnet for yeah Somebody who's very energized very excited and has a profitable product who just realized that They are ready for you know a full-time marketer and can pay a base pay plus performance So your original EHR isn't going to be very high, but your job is to do some really good marketing Research and to see that you're willing to put some skin in the game and go I think that if I put these split tests in if I Created this order bump if I created this continuity program if I Make sure your list hygiene was really good and improved your inbox, but I don't like that's a whole lot of stuff Mm-hmm, but you know, and so it's an investment But that's how you explain to them and justify why you're going to give me this percentage Because there's this is a lot but you really need to make a list of these are all the things I'm doing. This is Each one of these are expert level full time jobs. Do you understand that person like that I'm talking to you? These are all full email, like list manager, full time job, affiliate manager, full time job, marketer, full time job, copywriter, full time job, right? These are expert level things, and you can do all of these things, or you can hire somebody out. So either there's a budget for it, so it's not coming out of you and you make that agreement, to begin with, but either way, I think that that's super leverage, gets you into some exciting stuff, and can keep your EHR around $250 or better. For sure, better would be great. Cause let's do some quick during math. Hold on a second. So if we did, if we had you working at, go away, what is this, these camp? called you base camp. Bye Felicia, hold on, kept you here later. turn 50. I can say, turn 50. the truck times 30 times 4 equals $32,000 a month.
