00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I went into my own settings and check like aah.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good, 1996, I was Apple support. You're kidding.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.

And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Because Maria always does that for everybody else, I want to put that script in. Well, and also in a smart way that like, I, you know, I could, you know, put up a thing in analytics thing to do some stuff. It's just I don't want to be then tied up for the next month, doing done for you work at the cost of my stuff. So, so there's a happy medium. But I do know that I got pretty energized when I saw that YouTube video this morning about those guys that made it two million to nine months. I'm like, what? But yeah, I mean, there's, there's, and I have some, like, like one gal just paid me 500 this morning just to do a VSL script for her, which I know should be more, but I figure if it only takes me two solid hours to do it, I could just leverage that and sell maybe a few more in Ellen's group, because I just mentioned to her all, I was thinking of doing this, and she said, okay, I'll pay you. The licensing of the funnel that I've built, I'm in talks with this one guy that might want to buy it. So, but I've never done it before licensed on actual funnels, so I don't know what the details, so we'll see if that goes anywhere. But that basically, I would transfer the funnel, my ad copy, the actual ebook I created into his thing. But, There's some nuances to it though because it wasn't a profitable funnel. It's a break even funnel Which is still amazing for look take a funnel that was meant to sell People to kreena's and mine like you know now it's for just one cape product program and book a call to her 4800 things So that's the only thing and part of me was like if I have money just sitting in the bank account I could just run out to it in a new account and find a really good ecom Academy ecom course to Be an affiliate for and use the funnel cuz it was 20% conversion rate like for this $3 thing So I'm like man But that's the issue just missing a back end So I don't know if this guy would want it without a back end and I'm not going to that's kreena's intellectual property like how to Build a drop ship store and I don't want to go create a course without I don't want to sell it to him Without him knowing all of the details like I never want that because he could be someone to be the future that would buy other funnels that I'm make or something he knows.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right? So I mean, as long as you're up front about what he gets and what he doesn't get, then let him design.
00:10:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, that's what I've done. I've sent him everything. All the Facebook ads cost the screenshots of all the funnel stats, everything. So from the get go, this is really built for someone who already has a mid ticket or high ticket 1000 or more ecom kind of course and then it's perfect for them. But it's interesting. was I'm learning this because then he's like, let's say a ClickFunnels platform. said, well, no, I wouldn't get my ClickFunnels account. Like, so all these things, I guess some people who are into buying and selling funnels, it's a really interesting, you know, I guess they're used to you just giving them everything. So I think, like, if I were to do it again, I would put it into System IO and be like a separate account, right? Because like, that's it. And then here, here's just this my account and the email I set up for this funnel like that.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, you could duplicate eight. So, and this is what I was talking to Seth about doing, too, is because he's got that breakthrough challenge. And in Ontoport, you can just shove it into somebody else's Ontoport account. You can do that in high level. It's called Snapshot. And if you did that in System.io, but what if you duplicated that in these other things, and you said, oh, if you got System.io, it's already built for you. Here you go. Here's the cost of, so it's not even really a licensing fee. It's a, you know, how we had those, like, templates for VSLs and things like that. You could get infusion socks, campaigns, where they had it. It was, it was basically a part of infusion soft. wasn't a show they do it now. It's not even called that anymore. Now it's like a keep or something, right? Anyway, but you could either do it yourself. It probably wouldn't take too long as long as you were familiar. with it. But if it's basically so you've got landing pages, sales page, checkout pages, unless they're all in one, order bumps, fulfillment. Well, thank you pages, right? And then whatever the sequences are, all of the platforms are relatively similar. As long as you can navigate to it, you just create it and create the automations. It will probably only take you a few hours. And now you've got it in multiple platforms, and you can tell it to people on the platform that they're on. As long as the platform allows you to share it, like high level does, on-trip port does, and you'd have to have an on-trip port account, which is way too expensive for that, but high level.
00:12:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And system IO would be just copying the funnel or if I just create a separate account. Yeah. I'm still here. level for that too, to an extent. so yeah, so, so it is, we'll just see where that goes. And because yeah, I just had that brainstorm yesterday morning, I'm like, wait a minute. There's one on that basically, I created some tip to tail and it's like, what the ? Like, I should be compensated for this, you know? So, but it did make me think of all my other stuff, too. Like, I have micro for magic. I've got high ticket toolkit.
00:13:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have, like, a document, a library of what what offers you have and what you sold them for?
00:13:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, up to date current one, but yes.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I would probably just need an hour to make it up to date with stuff.
00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, what if, what if you did that and we brainstorm together and figure out maybe there's a different type of stock that you could offer or you offer this and then upsell down to all the type of thing. just to generate some cash for you without bogging you down timeways and done for you type stuff.
00:14:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if I crack the core on how to sell, like you mean like sell the funnel to other people, like to like.
00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, so like, yeah, the micro offer magic, like itself, if it's a course, like what I wanna see, what is your library of things that you have that you've sold that you could sell again, maybe with a couple of tweaks, maybe you need to update a checkout page, maybe you need to connect to people. I don't know, like what is everything that you have that is still relative, where you could put together an offer and say, you know, here's all the things, pick one, choose one, or pay this price and get everything, that type of thing.
00:14:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, like to the consumer to buy. Yeah, than like sell the actual pay, this is a converting funnel, I want this. Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because, so you said you need $3,000 a month, is your, like, light's on cost?
00:15:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, yeah, $3,000 a month, doesn't it? was really $5,000 a month?
00:15:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. if we could figure out, um, just, so I like to do hybrid things so that we reduce the burden, um, it's the done with you done for you stuff that has higher ticket and you can sell easier, but it comes with a bigger burden. So you want to kind of offset that with another type of offer, if you can, which doesn't increase the burden so much, but also gives you a little bit more income and then potentially has, you can sell other things affiliate offers, your own offers, whatever. But, um, so in order for us to sell, like, a 6k package, we don't have to do anything other than. Write an offer get some eyeballs on it. I'm thinking and You I mean if we sell two of those you're good We're right and and if if we can sell to you we can sell two more we can sell two more like Not all the ones right, but build up the queue for it. feel like that is the simplest way to Put some money into your need account and then siphon off the tiny for whatever We might be building and meanwhile give us a little time.
00:16:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give you some breathing space So that we can build something that's scalable and build some con together So wait, so let's just repeat that last part like if I brain just zoned out for a second but to me like If you and I create a 6k offer Sales page for or even a Google Doc with what's including right here's we get here's the problem is here's what you get That might be a faster path to cash in the next two weeks.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's exactly what I'm saying.
00:17:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, that's what I thought. And I agree. That's sort of why I've held off. was going to send out 30 looms a day to all my people saying, hey, I've got this 100 days to 1k days. You know, thinking of, you know, launching this and book a call for me if you're interested. then I was going to sell whoever gets on the call, but I know it's not a. I wanted to wait until we kind of strategize because yeah, because I'd rather have something we build together.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if I'm going to do looms, I'd rather do looms than to that.
00:17:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the most lovers thing because there's no overhead cost to that. So we can just split it 50 50. I can pay for ads if you're strapped right now and we just figure all of that later. So. And or I just paid for it and like you're doing some of the looms like that's the thing we can figure out how to split like I don't. there's a lot of things I don't like to do that you love to do. So if we figure out a good balance where you're happy with what you're doing, I'm happy with what we're doing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm sure that we can find those things really well. And of course, I'm a grown woman, I can do things I don't want to do and will do things I don't want to do. And likewise, but I think that's the fastest easiest thing to not bog us down to also establish a little bit of a brand awareness with us operating together. A kind of a mutual audience, which is going to have a different vibe than just Maria or Justina. And then when you have the money and you're reading, you're not like, how do I hustle up some money? Now we can talk about structure more frequently and really build out what's our long term thing, build our maybe individual courses, not individual, like a combined course, serve in the way that we're talking about, you know, we could and calls and co-working all of that stuff that we were discussing, but I think it's not, we can't even have that conversation until we've got money coming in for you if you don't have to worry about it.
00:19:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm supposed to get started for us working together, right? So now it's time to pull the trigger.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it'd be so great to fulfill that for somebody. You can't get a quality, that. I don't even know anywhere where you could go get somebody who's going to give you the business structure that I would give them and the marketing that you would give them. For that price and for the level of service that we would give them, the handholding that just we've got you and not talking down to you.
00:19:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's so much condescension in this world.
00:19:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You know, like, and I was talking to my love last night and he is so glad that I'm working. with no years and doctors and things like that. he's like, you just, he goes, I'm glad you're done with the internet marketing world.
00:20:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, I'm not, I'm never going to be, but here's why.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People need me. Like, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't have this experience if it wasn't for my path through here. Well, there are so many of us who, people just, they go here because the marketers are marketing. All they know is I need to make money and I need to do it from home because I've got kids or I'm taking care of my parents. Like I can't leave, but I need to change my life and the opportunities available to me aren't working. So they go online about business, the people that are the loudest are internet marketers. So that's who they're going to hear. said, I have to be there to teach them there is real business to be learned and taught and available to them in where they're at. They're in the internet marketing world. I'm going to be here being a voice of reason and logic and real systems. Real service, real values, real KPIs, you know, and not just how can I get money out of people as fast as I can and launch the next thing before they catch on to what I'm doing.
00:21:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:21:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Oh, this is reaction.
00:21:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He said, yeah, you're right. I know you have a call. just say it like that, but. Yeah, but it's been a long time trying to get him. Because he just hates that. He just knows how many of these people that and some of them look like. Christian choir boys and they're in the back rooms like bankrupting people and getting them to sell their houses and mortgage them to buy this mastermind coaching thing. And then these people aren't qualified. They just got sold and they lose their houses and they lose their, you know, they get divorced. They just, it destroys them. people suicide, like it's. Yeah, really.
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
horrible thing and they're out here like I'm the greatest thing in the world and people are literally worshiping them and It's really disgusting So yeah, that's why I have my pros and cons because there's a bit of a bro culture, you know Alex from Ozzie and who he attracts, right?
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I don't want anything to do with it I almost even don't study it because I look at it and then as soon as I hear like The things that he has said he's like, yeah I was willing first of all he lied and he admitted to lying and he was like whatever it takes to make the money and He said different things I'm like you told me enough to know that you have no integrity that Selling is the bottom line and that you can't be trusted Why would I listen to you that that makes no sense? want nothing to do with pretty much everybody in this world Or they're all about and hub and yeah, just go park it over here And I'm just like I there is a group of people that you know, and it's not the super religion disorienting, but it's the conservative. Like, I want to make money. I do love marketing. It's exciting. But I don't want to be slimy about it. And I don't want to be condescending. And I don't want to sell a grandma out of her home or a dad out of his retirement or, you know, all that kind of thing. And there's particular language that's used in a particular vibe, energy. And I'm in that world, but I'm not of that world.
00:23:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what mean? Yeah, exactly. No, I'm the same. Yeah. What do you want to do?
00:23:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want to open up a Google Doc and start mapping out? Yes. So you now is the thing that you were looking at today, the YouTube stuff relative to what what we were doing. Does it have any bearing in terms of like creating an offer or structure?
00:23:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
we'll open up the Google Doc. think you started one, right? It might as far as The initial part of the YouTube video was kind of interesting how they just decided to throw up a 5K offer that really wasn't really created yet, but they were always one week ahead, right, and but they made sure they treated the customer like gold so they got what they want. So, it probably was your typical thing of they, I mean, it was all in German, right, so I don't know what the inside of the school program is, but it was probably definitely all about having a good offer building an audience, you know, having accountability. That was one thing that was intriguing. They offered a weekly accountability person or no daily, I think, so we could have Sally check in on them every day if we wanted to, you know. But yeah, yes, so I mean I can take a look at this off.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I've got Stephanie Stephanie's $30 an hour and that's mostly because it's partially benevolent and she needed and I believe in a button so I don't do that but she could help with that too.
00:25:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, and, and, or even down the road have a I be that person right that yeah, I'm trying to get my documents alone.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:25:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure. Yeah.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mama, I'm a bear marketing that one. Okay. Let me share. Okay. That's weird. You just said participants can now see your application, which I've never. It's never said that before.
00:25:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just. Yeah. Oh, yes.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't really have. Um, the offer, I put it, it was in, I think I just set it in box or my bad. Hold on. I don't want this.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You gonna buy another backup?
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. I think I might just pin a room like I really don't even want to do any video period, but I'm like, do you think this is upstairs?
00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two of our bedrooms are that dark blue color actually that you have.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I like these just, um, when I, when I look at, like the contrast and the energy of the light in, in some videos, I also like there was, they have this like bright yellow and I just think the energy of the bright yellow is really nice. Um, and I, I think about energy and I think about the color psychology, uh, a lot yellow is calming and trust, blue is trust also. anyway, um, see, here's your Google doc. I'm not open to that. And then also, I think it was just a voice message that I left you about what we could do or maybe we just talked about it.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know. I love it in the voice.
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I put it in a Google Doc? About the offer? Let me look at the amount of shared stuff that you shared with me. Okay. I think it was in a voice message to be honest.
00:27:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I just put a path for making $50k a month. There it is. It's a different doc. Oh, Tina Partnership. Yeah. I've been almost manic this week, but yeah, so I went there like SL, $6,000, a written custom business, ops slash system slash team plan, and a custom marketing plan. We'll create it together on a two hour call with them. We do not fulfill it. it's created, right? We don't build anything. just tell them how to do it. But then what we could do is upsell them into a group coaching where they get support or it could just not be group coaching if we don't want to have like a group offer with them and anything. But the follow up is, you know, 200 or $400 a month and I would go more with like 400 a month for ongoing support through voxer and email. So like they could ask a question and be like, I don't know what to do about this or I'm stuck. got a row of blocks. So maybe they need some brainstorming. Maybe they need us to build a formula for them to do some calculations because they can't put the things together. But what I'm thinking here is before, so we can sell it to anybody, but we'll give them some criteria for us. have to have this, right? So anything that basically spells out, you know how to make money and you're not going to risk losing your home or not beating your kids in order to make this payment and investment with us. We could do some financing offer as well, but I still would want to put this in here. And I do think we should offer financing because I think that people that we want to help most might need that kind of help. So then what we do is we have them fill out a very thorough thing form and it will help us understand what their assets are.
00:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you have that you have sold before?
00:29:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times did you sell it? How much did you make over what period of time? How did you get leads and eyeballs on it? Do you currently have, you know, a flow of eyeballs, even if it's five a month on your offer? Do you have a social media following? Do you post blogs? you have a group like all of the potential ways that you have organic traffic coming to your offer? Do you You have money for an ad budget. If so, what is it? You know, we want to be able to spend at least a couple dollars a day because we could do something with that little bit, even if it's on YouTube. Are you comfortable with making videos? Have you made videos? you have a video editor? All of these types of things, right? OK. We're going to tell them $6,000 plus. You should set aside roughly $1,000 budget for contractors and ads. So we're going to minimize everything. But I think that we could get, if we needed graphics or video editing, we could get that done. And we could give them a decent ad budget with an extra $1,000 that they spend. And so part of our marketing plan would be taking stock of what they already have and who they have, right?
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what their products are and say, OK, and we would do the same thing for them that we would do for us, which is not the best. Sorry, Chin, you want me to start writing this?
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in there because I'm not as much an auditory person like I can do whatever you like yes I do have badminton recording so um okay from there too okay okay I lost my train of thought and it's totally okay it's just the way my brain works um so so my thinking was that if we do a really um thorough written intake so if they can't express to us in writing what they have if they can't answer the intake form well we already know we're gonna have issues being successful with them okay okay um but but if they have something so we're we're going to say okay here is the most leveraged offer that we see and I would do for everybody a hard-brid thing so I would say I would um now we would do this together right and and and come to some sort of agreement kind of riff a little bit before we talk to them but I think our target should always always be help them find kind of the tier thing which is done for you done with you and DIY type of version meaning there's either a product that you buy yourself and maybe it's not done anything you don't have to do anything maybe it's just a product that you purchase but we want to figure out a value stack where there is a scaling because we want them to get their money back ASAP right and we know that the higher value things generally tend to be a bigger investment and if they were already good at packaging these things together then they wouldn't be reaching out to us so that's my premise is that they're going to need help figure out that option so then what we have to look at and is go okay what would it take to fulfill this what kind of support do you need are you going to need somebody to help you create some graphics for social media or for ads are you going to You need a video editor, know, did you because YouTube ads are going to be the least expensive if you're willing to do it and probably get you the best results in terms of getting leads. Can you write it? Do you need to go hire some copywriting help? you like some AI prompts to help you write stuff because we can help you with that? Well, um, so I think that if somebody, so what we would want to do is figure out what is the baseline of what somebody's doing like, can they, are they already generating or have they ever generated even $2,000 on selling something, selling a service or product? Maybe that number needs to be like for my clients, it's a minimum of your earning $50,000 a month and that's minimum because Even at that point generally their profit margin suck and they're not managing money. Well, it's just this weird Growth period generally it's not super optimized They hustled to get there and they're like I can't get out of this thing Whereas it's lower they're more conservative with the expenses because they need everything to count so Yes, so I thinking about what the parameters are and giving some really clear examples So a person who fits it can look at it and go yeah, that's me.
00:34:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's totally me.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh That makes sense and then so We would do a profit calculator Well Okay, so I have different versions of this and I just plug in people's numbers and There are formulas that you can do change. So I'm going to duplicate this. This was actually something I had been thinking about for myself. Um, so let's say, um, Maria, Tina, um, joint business plan, um, and offer creation. And it's 6,000. And if we sold three a month, um, then we come over here. There's no attrition. So that's just how much it would make us. But then let's say that we upsell them to, um, private access, and it's monthly and it's $400. It's those same people. So, um, oh, sorry. Yeah, sold is three. And it's price annually, price monthly, 400. And so then that would come over, I'm thinking it was wrong with that one. Yeah, price annual, price quarterly. Yeah, anyway, we'll just do it this way, 1,200. It'll go populated like it's supposed to. It's not there's something wrong with my formula. But anyway, fix the formula. But we could do something like this with them and show them, OK, here's all you have to do. And so you play around with prices a little bit until you get a number over here that matches what they needed to be. And the first target is going to be how much money they need to make. And the second target is going to be how do they see how their investment in us has returned to them. At the very least, they should make their money back. But, you know, we'd like to at least double their return on investment and that shouldn't be hard if we're selecting the right people and just giving them the value is the clarity and the confidence. So most of the time people have stuff and they're like, yeah, but I don't, should I do this? Should I do that? And so they're not clear. And when they make a decision, they're still, I don't know if I should do this. I'm picking something. And so they hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, they don't pull the trigger, they do it and they're like two days later, it's not working and they abandon ship and they go do something else. They don't have confidence, but you can't abandon ship. It takes weeks most of time to get an offer to convert, get the ads to work well, to dial the audience in that type of thing and start actually making money. It can be different, it depends on where you're running ads, depends on how good your ad is, depends on your offer, it depends on your pricing. along all of these different things. But on average, I would say roughly around six weeks before you really get some kind of traction. So anyway, and so we can look at the different things that they offer and say, okay, so here's where people come in, and maybe it's a $5 offer. How many people do you need to make X? And if that conversion rate percentage is 2% up to the next offer, then at this price point, how much does that make? That type of thing. I've seen you do those types of numbers in your posts, but this would be something where we clear it and we'd make all the formulas correct and make sure that they're working. And so like lead magnet here, leads per month, let's say it's 500 eyeballs on there, cost per lead is, we'll say it's $2, convert to product, we'll say it's, so if you did a $3 offer, you got like 50% right?
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Conversion was 20%. Well, it's 29%.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
29%. Price of product was $3. And so average cost probably, why not? I definitely average value per lead. Oh, yeah. So if they upsell, but then you had a $25 offering and more converted to that, right?
00:39:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Well, the average order value one day or value was about $30 as well. But then within 30 days, like they're on a thing to buy a $1,000 or $4,800 thing, but we've never ran it long enough to calculate, you know, what the conversions were on that.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So there are some things missing in here because I was doing it as an exercise and then I stopped, but we could create something like this where we screen share and we walk them through and we would populate it with information from their intake form. They already told us about their products and they already and we would have gone and looked at them So we'll do a little research before getting on the call so that we can make that two hours and be done We're done.
00:40:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah Well, I walk people through on today's it's okay if I share screen.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, me stop. I'm sure what I got I walked through and maybe we make an amalgamation of stuff But I walk people through today like a customer journey map, right? Like and actually was giving examples one was even yours PTM Maximizer and say you offered a six and six score of six figures six months. Okay, whatever free school please example and I share with them my you know journey map here, but then it goes into a Like this is rated live on the call with one of the people today So then it goes into a value ladder like this kind of a high-ticket ascension thing from low ticket So yeah, so her case it wasn't free. This is this was your micro offer So basically, where's your micro offers? hers was Facebook ads for financial advisors, let's say it's 1440, and then what's your order bump? 27, it doesn't have to be in order but this could just be upsell or whatever. So maybe that's better if I just say upsell, upsell one. And then I'll just, just for the remedy, I'll just take up 100 deals, pack of the safe proven, Facebook and IG proven templates. And then I asked her what does she want next, her lifestyle? Cause she does have a hot done for you stuff, like, but she said, I'd like to select her 1000 of course, that's more passive. So yeah, let's create the 100K scale fast systems on nine seven. So then it fills all this, populates this out, right? So did you build this? Yeah. Nice. So yeah, and also I have a whole ad challenge calculator, all that stuff too. then here if we work backwards so let's work backwards how much do we really want to make and she said she wants to make 15 grand a month so okay so we weren't just played to the numbers everything in blue is what you change so well let's say um you want seven sales of a thousand and and that's almost 7,000 here right let's just for easier number let's change just a thousand so i'm a graphical person right so i like seeing graphically what it is uh oops i love that so step 300k skills this is so so say we got seven sales that's seven grand and then okay well how what's the agreement going to be of the people that bought up cell one um it could be of people who just bought the micro carbon can skip step two but i like to have it up so on yeah so so this is five percent so so so in order to make 7,000 here we need 140 people here right the five percent and then that's um you know total revenue here would be 380 because the Facebook and IG templates was 27. could always change that price point and that changes this too. And it's like, okay, what's the conversion rate, people for $27, people who bought the $14, you know, Facebook ads for financial buyers, what's the conversion rate needed? An order of $1 should convert at 30 to 50% or else you're bad, you know, and an upsell should convert at about 30%, especially since it's only $27. So, 40% is very, very conservative. That's going to bring in this money and then how many, you know, sales of this micro-off you need 350 sales. So, that's a 10% conversion rate because it's only $14. Again, this could change drastically if it's like 3%. So, that's for $15,000. So, how many page visits do you need? $3,500. I have a whole ad calculator. Basically, if you're paying, say, this could be all organic, first of all, or joint ventures, know, people have your email. I'll give you a 50% commission on the front end or whatever, or it could be, hey, you're paying a dollar or $2 per click, then you can figure out your ad spend as well. So still good. If you're paying $2 per click, $7000 to double your money when it's almost passive. That's cool. So that's what we have. then like when we do it list, so moving is something pretty like this. I did your PT maximizer, say, okay, you have a school. So, so, uh, 100 days to 10k. So no less up that one. Is it here? Yeah. So I was like, okay, your value ladder was you had a school group, and you have a private time energy maximizer, 20 bucks, and then you've got 6,000, you know, 6,000 a third course and that 6,000. So wherever the course name is, right? So, so two sales, you know, that's that's 12 grand, say 5% of the people to buy profit time energy maximizer. buy it. So the thing that's wrong with this is that you could skip this middle one and just have two steps. Like, so 5% of these people, 267 people buy it, right? But anyway, say you have a 15% of your free school community buy your $20 thing, then you only need 267 people in your free school community to produce 12,800 a month, sort of. Anyway, so yeah. Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. Yeah. Video came back and I'm like, oh, I just moped.
00:45:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. But I guess the biggest thing is, so what's the promise?
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, always work backwards.
00:45:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, we're going to learn each other how we each work. But what's the ultimate promise? We're giving them like, for these guys, they're promises like five figure months, right? So in a six week course, they gave them all the tools to create test optimized. They had a community. Coaching forward to our calls a week, which is a lot. I wish they had accountability. Again, accountability partner who supports you on a daily basis, support by the community and chat. But there was no done for you stuff there either. And if we come back to, there's.
00:46:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's two articles one on one or group group.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was the price? Yeah, group.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. What was the promise?
00:46:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You. They, they kind of are promising. So here they're levels. They have the free community. They have this mission five, six weeks. A self-employed person, you can grow your monthly sales in a relaxed manner to five digit figures. So they're promising five figures a month, whether it's 1000. Wait, no, is that 10,000? so 10,000. Yeah, they're promising 10k months then. Actually, their YouTube video was called YouTube. They had a YouTube. to video. I think it had the word 10k in it. Yeah, become part of the school revolution, learn how to easily make 10 to 15k a month with one hour day. That's, that was their promise.
00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I think that the promise is that we cut your time to actually launching your products like by 80 or 90 percent and actually make sure you do it with clarity and confidence. Because if you're trying to come up with a business plan yourself and figure out the offer, the offer is one of the hardest things for people to figure out, to figure out the price points. We could offer, so not only the offer but the hook, right? Because it's going to happen in our heads where we're going, this is why somebody would want to buy this. So the hook for the coffee is going to come out. The USP is going to come out.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We will help you define your USP.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We will help you define, so in your offer, that's going to be the price points, the potential order bump, upsell one, upsell two, so an entire value stack, as well as a way to create where possible. We have to put a caveat, a recurring subscription revenue, MRR for you. There is no, we can't guarantee you're going to make sales. Now we can also offer to create an ad set for them, just some really basic stuff. You've got Canva skills, I've got Canva skills, we've got people, when you put the hook, like we have some kind of templated meaning, I mean, there's just a really basic thing, there's the kind of glory shot, there's a picture of whatever the product is, or a screenshot of the result, or it depends. and all of the product is by far, right? And then a headline and then a call to action. We could do that in our sleep. So we could just go ahead and create it. We could have some different Canva templates or get a low cost person to do this for us and build that in, right? So we're gonna invest maybe bucks having so many creative graphics. But ultimately we should have somebody who's working for us build a library of ad graphics that we can use and just rotate through, changing up the color scheme, dimensions, things like that, depending on the platform. We would also give them channel marketing, channel advice, right? Here's how you put this up to Instagram. Here's and we would tell them, so like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and then Twitter, potentially LinkedIn, depending on who it is. And, basically say, okay, here's the version of the content that you use for this, this, this, and this, give them advice. And that's it. We're structuring everything for you, but also, so a lot of times, people are like, oh, I can't. I don't have anybody to help with this. I don't know how to we'll write a copy for you. You and I can rip copy out, but it is correct. We can recommend copywriters to you so you get access to our Rolodex, right? We'll introduce you to somebody to hire for copy for graphics, for video editing, for any of the things that you need. So you get our our service provider, Rolodex. And then, like, so now you have of a plan by two marketing and business mavens with a combined nearly 60 years worth of experience in business and a top level experience, making a lot of money and in a sustainable way and integrity. Right? So we've seen we've both generated millions for others tens of millions of hundreds millions from over a million for myself personally while barely working really and taking care of my kids. So what we're doing is in the matter of two hours taking all the stuff that they've had and they've been thinking about and will create multiple versions of the offer, right? Because you're The document, the calculator that you just had did that, mine does it where you can kind of mix and match, like here's the different things that you can offer. Some people will take this, people will take that type of thing, so a different kind of offer stack. We could help them define their avatar so they know who they're marketing to so that they can dial in their messaging and get really clear on their messaging. It's probably too expensive for us to pay for a similar web, if we have a few people buying this, I would love to have an account of similar web and look at their competitors and figure out how they could stand up there.
00:52:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me ask you a question, why do you like similar web so much versus just doing like a typical, like, like, I And I'm just riffing with you here because you can see where they're paying for ads that you can't necessarily see in a Google search.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like there might be a place that they're running ads and spending a lot of money that you can't tell on a Google search, which means your buyers are there and you know that because because I tell them to do a abundance analysis right where you just competitive analysis, basically, where they I line competitors, what their headline headline benefits are, but I get what you're saying, so they know that that's great too. And it's probably better for somebody who's got a lot more money to spend and who can go, you know, spend money in these areas where it, but it's basically just a potential pools of customers that you can't identify.
00:53:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's not just who your competitors are and what their offer is, but it's true.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are they getting their customers from?
00:53:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's really just market research, but yes, yeah, so and we would do that ahead of time and bring that to them to the call We wouldn't spend our time doing research on the call what we would do is show them everything that we came up with and Spend all the time making sure that they're really clear on what we figured out Hmm, I think we could do that in an hour of our own time before the calm. Yeah so They're coming away with like I can do this and then though so We would recommend and say 90% of people are going to want the follow-up because you're going to have questions and You know, this is a this is the plan, right? is $6,000 is plan It's not the support, but the support is only $400 a month and you get access to us through water If you want another call, could have all a cart kind of price for getting on a call with us. That needs to fall within our effective hourly rate of time that we're willing to do. Because the difference with the call is now I have to block off time on my calendar and we have to coordinate, whereas with Boxer I don't have to do that. So that is why Boxer can be so inexpensive. But they get the same quality really. You don't get the feeling of they've got us on a call and we've locked up our time. We have to tell them we can't make a promise that you're going to get your money back. You can make a promise that you're going to have experience that is worth the money. Because everything that we're going to teach you about your own stuff, about the offer, about how to launch it, about how to pay for support. who, who to get support, we can even make that connection, we're going to save you more than $6,000 worth of time. So let's say your effective hourly rate, theirs, so let's say $6,000, is divided by $50,000. would be 120 hours. And if you think about that, you know, somebody's, how many months do people generally spend before, like, while trying to think about product and put it together. If they actually even launch it, could Karina have launched the stuff that she did without you? right, okay. yes, we're going to show that, but we're also going to show what are the odds of and the statistics of my daughter. Also, I just realized I am missing, I just missed a train. Oh, no, did you go to it? No, I need to do this. But. I can't see the doc now so I lost my train of time.
00:57:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm going to reach, reach, get, get, go.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, yeah. statistically, most people will. Hum and ha about trying to create an offer and it can take them years. To launch something. So they generally make their money. Just kind of hustling. And it's not a well thought out offer. It's not scalable. It's not evergreen. So they're constantly launching thing after thing hustle after hustle. They end up taking clients that they don't like just to be able to get by. And they're doing it alone. And they don't have the feeling of experts have given you validation for your offer. And I helped you structure it. Like where else are you going to get to like time tested experts who. Like, my clients pay me $1,000 an hour, they're getting two hours, but they're also getting a very specific plan and your time, and we're going to spend time doing our research and preparing for what we ever get to the call, so it's not just two hours of our time, you know, we get on a call.
00:58:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, get it.
00:58:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, so.
00:58:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It sort of reminds me a little bit of, um, do you remember, did you want redend Kennedy's books ever and stuff?
00:58:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, no, I hear about them all the time. It's not audio, so I can't say, but I can't read anymore very long.
00:58:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, yeah, he was like, who I learned marketing.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
from ages ago, probably 25 years ago.
00:59:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he used to have, and I doubt if he doesn't anymore, because he's like, yeah, he's probably tired now, practically.
00:59:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's all his stuff.
00:59:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They worked together. You didn't know that? Yeah, yeah. No, you bought his stuff.
00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But like, I don't think he's like working every day anymore stuff.
00:59:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he was like, his peak was 20 years back to him by now. That's right. That's right. Yeah. His peak was 20 hours, 20 years ago. Sorry, but yeah, he would have a diagnostic day where he charged 18,000 for a client to come in and spend the whole day with him. And he would map out their entire plan. if he wanted Dan or his team to build it, then that would be another fee, but he would reduce that fee by 19,000 that you paid.
00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so maybe then we build in the voxel support, because again, it gives us some freedom and maybe it's for 90 days. if you want more time after that, that way the support is built in.
00:59:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's not a sticker shock price kind of thing.
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay so and it kind of stacks in the value right so it's more of our time um And it shouldn't be more of a commitment and I would want to make sure that they're being successful and And getting through it and maybe after we do a few of them we can figure out how to restructure it um I don't know.
01:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are your thoughts? I like it because you're right you you this is something you hit nail on the head If I were to share the screen, but I know you better go soon, right?
01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
many more minutes do we have until till 10?
01:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
already missed this training, but I'll I can watch the recording. Okay, so um They are constantly launching thing after thing because they're hustling and taking clients just to get by And they are feeling alone like that. think Is the most emotional aspect of it because that is probably so many people there and that's me too You know, um It's why I spent two thousand dollars in a micro after thing. And I'm very good at this.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I need help that much. Then I'm just like, no brainer, take my money. You know, there are other people. And so, yeah.
01:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and it's bespoke. Like we can kind of make it bespoke because we're not saying, well, correct me if I'm wrong, you're not thinking of the path that we're building a micro off of them, right? Like it's whatever fits their needs, right? So it's bespoke because it could be a via self funnel. It could be just a YouTube video. Like, I don't think I shared with you, but one of my friends, Carrie's doing the most amazing thing. Well, is it it's okay if I digress to another avenue, but it's just good data point for what we're teaching. So, Carrie is a guy that paid 15 grand to Ravi Abubala to scale his company. He teaches a clean business opportunity, which is meaning he teaches people how to start a remote cleaning business and he's the real McCoy. So I was this customer services manager at where Avi's company, this is a few years back. And Kari asked for a refund. He's pissed off because he's just like, you guys just want to throw Facebook ads at this to be self on it. But I'm telling you, organic LinkedIn is what worked for me. How come you're not teaching really much? He's like, the only person that ever added value here in this company was Maria. You know, so we kept in touch, right? We're good friends. And also he's, he's, he, he of went down a dark hole after that and just took a off and just, you know, he's very Christian as well. So he, that's why we stay in touch. And he was, anyway, it was all good. But to make a long story short, he just continued his organic thing and he goes, we're out. So six months ago, I'm just going to do TikTok and I can't believe in 30 days. I actually made more money than the last six months. He just went live every day on TikTok, just talking about, yeah.
01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
me tell you what I'm wrong.
01:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think we should do that. I think so too. And then with that, well, this is where it gets interesting. With that confidence that he built and probably got boy in bed, Messer, he then went. to YouTube but not post every day or maybe not even every week but he created the most amazing YouTube organic funnel I've ever seen and he shared it with me. It's a like hour-long training but it's not like a webinar like traditional five-step webinar this is what you do the bold prompt of a lot. It was pure teaching but this is where his magic comes in. He shows his face and he's talking the video, hey look this works for me. I'm doing this is how much money making. I've all these other testimonials people doing really well with it so let me just walk you through how to start your own remote cleaning company. He goes and he opens up a Google Doc and he's got all the steps and the words to it everything so it's like a business plan of how to start a remote cleaning company and he goes listen I'd love to share this follow-along document with you underneath this YouTube video in the description just click on it all you have to do is enter your email and you will get this like he gives away the document right and then of course he's under on the thank you page giving the document click here for the Google Doc. Actually, it's a notion template underneath it. He says, if you'd like to call for me to help you with this, you know, we do have a course for this. So it was a very, very pure value, so many comments on that video saying you're the first person that's done a YouTube video or a webinar that's actually given value, this is so valuable, I can go off and do this on my own even without you, but, and then people go with him. So he's now selling a $10,000 a day to 5k packages a day through this organic funnel. Now he's going to add more fuel to it by doing Instagram lead ads or Facebook lead ads that take him to that YouTube video, but it's that YouTube video. It's different than anybody else in the marketplace is doing. He's basically given so much away.
01:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. There's a lot of, I mean, Bob Berg talks about go giving, right, the go-giver stuff, and, the thing, and that's why I've thought about, you know, I would just give away the profit time and do max. because it teaches people what to do, but if they know that I can do that for them in an hour for free, why wouldn't they spend money with me if they've got money to spend it? Yeah. So we could do that exercise, you know, make it a video where we take somebody through it live and, you know, make it a real-time thing and offer it to somebody in the group, say, hey, this is what we want to do. want to make this a video. It's going to be on YouTube. you know, you're, you have to be willing to answer these questions. You can look at it in advance to know if you're okay with that, but this is what we want to do. And then the other thing that we could do is we could do one of these offers, free offer reasons, and do that with somebody. You know, somebody who can will take that and just like, thanks, I'll just go do it myself. Great. We don't need everybody. We don't like to force it. Well, the month, you know, so let's say 200 people see it and 196 of them do it themselves.
01:06:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And four people say, I need Tina and Maria to do it for me.
01:06:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I mean? So that's the power of abundance. And I do think that that's actually a much better model. I think that you get higher quality followers and bands that way. Yeah, I think that you they tell more people about you. And I think that's where, and also when there's this is what I know about people that have a lot of money, there's no barrier to entry and they can see everything that you know. They'll just reach out to you and they'll just say, look, I they'll offer you money. They'll say, I want to work with you. Here's a whole lot of money. Can I get some of your time because they already know, you know, and you didn't just give this away for free. Yeah. Yeah. And we, I really do think though that TikTok is the thing. I think, I think it's a fresh audience. think that are a lot of people who don't know anything about anything. So I don't think they're brainwashed. Um, internet marketers in Facebook and Instagram is the same because it's not the same. It's definitely different audience, the different people. But meta knowing what meta knows about everybody kind of puts people in this echo chamber of similarity. And TikTok is different. It's a completely separate algorithm with different data points of different, well, different algorithm. And then YouTube. So I would want to create the lives on on TikTok. And then so YouTube doesn't care about consistency. TikTok does and frequency. Very, very much. algorithms are about going live very frequently and when people are on and interacting with them. YouTube cares about how long people watch your content so quality because when they're serving up and it's just like you know SEO with Google like if you're bouncing up their pages they're not going to rank you high it doesn't matter if you stuff all the keywords in there if people aren't saying page then obviously they're not happy with what YouTube has served up and people won't stay on YouTube if they go search for something and YouTube gives them a video that's boring they don't like it whatever so they care about that you create it does not matter how consistent it just matters that the content is good yeah yeah so if we create that offer and so two videos that we could do is walk through the PTE maximizer with somebody and just gift it to somebody who has Sunday thing, leverageable, where they're like, because they're already making money. Maria, like anybody else is like, I've been doing this a while, I make money. But I don't feel like I've just like, I'm crystal clear on somebody like, I get up and I know what I'm working on every day. I don't stress about it. The money is there, money easily, even when I don't know what I'm doing, I don't spend my will too much. Because I know what my most leveraged things are. And I get to it. Because once I've learned it, I always learn it. You're not going to stop forgetting that. most people aren't that way. So that's the gift that we give somebody, but they have to have something that is clear, like a real estate agent showing houses versus making phone calls. They needed to have somebody else make the phone calls. They should be showing houses. That's like a sales call. So a salesperson doing sales calls versus writing copies. Somebody else should be writing the copy.
01:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They should be on the call because that's where the magic is.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's everything. For some people, it might just be creating videos, creating YouTube videos, creating TikTok videos. So your guy that you just talked about, his thing would be teaching and making sure that people actually know what they need to know so that they want to come and buy the things for them. So it's basically just informing his audience and that goes to people through the level of awareness by teaching them in different things about their business. So anyway, so we could create a really quality video walking somebody through that exercise and we can deal it a few times. So you've got a few different versions of the video. We can break that up into little shorts that we put on TikTok. We could break it up. We could make it a long, you know, whole-contained video on YouTube with some shorts also. And we could put it out too. We could put the bits, know, to the other platforms. I think if we focused on TikTok for live engagement, YouTube for low-cost leads, low-cost, high quality, targeted leads, think it's been very little money and do very well if we've got a great offer, and if we're demonstrating our value through the videos.
01:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, which, yeah, I always believe like the Eve Hutton thing, like when I open my mouth, they listen to me. I always know that, right? But it's just getting visible, right? Still about getting visible. So, TikTok for live interaction or engagement, as it is. Yeah. YouTube. Long-term growth. didn't even say those exact words, but something like that.
01:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
TikTok is so for low-cost. high quality leads targeted, but the content that we put there would be longer and higher value in that it's a complete picture, like girl trainings.
01:12:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so now Kari, here's his channel, Boring Business Growth Hub and Boring Business. I love that. Yeah, yeah, he's really funny. You'll love him. He's a really cool guy. Um, so yeah, so anyways, like he's he keeps pumping stuff out, but here's build, build a tent. In this video, we will overview the process of obtaining a trial. That is an ad. Hold on. A version of REX. All right, you guys. So in this video, we are going to be talking about building a. So he looks like a nice guy. He is. He created a four part series. And then if you haven't watched part one of this training, make sure you do go here. Like, so it's like a flywheel. Welcome to my YouTube channel, we show you how to build a remote cleaning business. It's just so good. his promise is $10,000 a week, by the way. don't think he has a guarantee on it anything, but he certainly has people who achieve it. But again, he goes follow along, so he goes, share the resources you will need, grab every single one of them. So he's got a follow along document here. you click here, and it comes over here, get you copy the follow along document, get my document. So we could totally create this kind of, I call it a mouse trap too.
01:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is our cheese. And I've been seeing that too, like that exactly, that's the model. And what I love about TikTok, and you can do it with YouTube too, is that we can join each other. So you can go live with another person. Because my biggest thing is I don't want to talk to myself. I don't want to talk to you, the ethers. I love to talk to Maria, and I think that we would riff so good. There might be other people that we might want to do additional conversations with them, so one great thing about TikTok is you're doing that type of thing with other people, so you get their audience, they get your audience, so if we're strategic about it and we're not overlapping the exact type of stuff, or just having abundance mindset know that it doesn't matter if we're not overlapping, because some of their people will like us better, some gave them all the gifts by letting them see that there's something else available.
01:14:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and he's making money, he says he's making about 4,000 a month now recurring, just because people are, this is his go-high level version that you know, say even if you don't buy my course, here's the booking software mandatory. cannot automate your business without it. We will use the software during the training 14-day free trial, and this is his go-high level snapshot for a cleaning business.
01:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that, and that is the other thing I want to do like I hate spending money where it's not making me money but I think that there is a lot um available in I mean go high level will pay for itself very quickly if we create our own snapshot and sell it as low cost so um I've got a girl that could help build that honestly we could probably build some of ourselves but uh and I don't know what they would be but like your micro offer whatever we come up with for these people um maybe we could say for the first um 10 people who buy this will build the automations for you in high level and if you we can put it in your own high level account don't have one get it through us yeah now we've got some people um buying it and uh so we could spend a little bit of money but we'd have the money coming in where we could spend that little bit and I've got a great girl that we could do it I have the ability to build some stuff too we can go with Dan so Anyway, we could make some money quickly with that, I think.
01:16:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think so. This could easily become, if we wanted to, 25K product, this is better than any masked maniac. I still have my friend, a frickin Russell Brunson, 25 grand for their inner circle mastermind, whatever. all they just taught them how to do a challenge, here's your challenge course, and you could get on group coaching calls, that's it.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's all they provided. said to me, what the hell? Which they ripped off of Seth. What? Which they ripped off of Seth, from Seth.
01:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, wasn't that kind of challenge. No, it was like a live, five day challenge, like I used to teach and stuff. Oh, okay.
01:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because Pedro Adao taught Russell Brunson how to do stuff, but Pedro got it from Seth.
01:16:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Pedro, well, Pedro teaches live challenges, like Pedro got it from Jason Flatt, and he got it from me. Because back 12 years ago, and. And Jason said it, Maria, you're the OG of doing challenges.
01:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You had 30,000 people go through your page. Girl, how did I never hear about you?
01:17:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, because like I didn't continue with one thing. Like I just shot an object.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did so many different things.
01:17:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's how. And so Jason created Pedro, because that was when I was doing stuff with Jason about eight years ago still. And Jason's like, Maria, I just got to tell you something. said, I'm going to help Pedro break out into the big group space, because I hate how it's all close knit group and stuff. He's done a few live challenges like you, but I know you're the OG, but he's kind of using a new modern way of Facebook groups and stuff. go, Jason, I'm using Facebook groups now too. Like when we used to do it eight years ago, yeah, we used just go to webinar. And that's it, because Facebook groups didn't exist back then. But I was, oh, I didn't realize that. But Peter had already paid Jason like 25 grand to get coached on it. So Jason then introduced him to all the other people. So I'm like, oh my God. So that's how Pedro got all the big name clients.
01:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
initially to and then that success breeds success right so we had this first few wins big name points and yeah yeah so there is and and to me this is not a shiny object again I like multiple options first of all because I do so it satisfies the shiny object by having different things I could bounce to but they're all within the same room so we could do a challenge around an offer like your marketing offer and we could teach people to do what we're going to do for somebody else right so if you want to put your own brain power in it but if you've got enough money that you would rather us do it so that you're really confident you did it right yeah and you want that one-on-one time because I would do that I don't I don't want to be in the group I don't want to have the group conversation not when I have money buy of money I just want to get it done fast right so some people don't have the money but they need the path and and that would be you are kind of give back thing. We put them through a challenge, sell it cheaper, but it's the same thing we're doing. So we're not jumping around from type of offer to type of offer. It's all about get started, get clear, and leverage and optimize your offer for a sustainable business that you keep running. It's an evergreen offer. So back to the fundamentals, like we're not here if you want to do launch after launch after launch after launch. You have to have something of value that has lasting quality and value. If you want to do the launch fine but we're not talking to you about that, we're not suggesting it because that's rework, then you're building yourself into a job of having to come up with the next thing. We don't advise that. That's hustle and grind mentality that will take a toll on your health, mentally, physically, emotionally on your relationships, and we don't. on anything to do with that. best of luck to you. Bye. Yeah. Um, now, if you would like to build a business that can support you, that can allow you to fill your purpose in life and serve the people that you feel called to serve, but be able to make money where you're not stressing about it and worrying about it. And then build something that has a compounding benefit where you're earning more month over month, year over year. Let's talk. Here's the system for that. Here's what you need to know, figuring out how to make it work takes a while. So, you need emotional support. That's what the group is for. You need structural support. That's what our plan is for. And then you just need to keep on keeping on until it works. And we've got the experience to show you what happens if you get stuck in a pitfall and you can come to us for help. That's what your money goes for.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just create, you just take that part of the recording.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the manifesto.
01:21:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. It's awesome. I loved what you said when you feel called to serve. So I love it. That's a good way to end this call. know you got to go.
01:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So okay. So I get you supposed to so happy. I feel like our calls are so productive and we get a little bit clearer, but I also feel like we're going to give so much to people anyway.
01:21:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what are the next steps? you want me to put together like a small offer dock and then you just go at your magic and just revise it and stuff?
01:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be the best thing for me. if we were to like this, that would be great.
01:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it comes out of me verbally, very quickly and pretty clearly.
01:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Putting it onto a document for whatever reason, generally I will pause. But if somebody starts the document, then I'm like, oh no, this, I did this. And then the structure gets really clear, really fast. And then we pick steps, tasks, assignments, due dates, execute, and then voila.
01:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So I'll do that this afternoon. I'm just going to go and pick up my dog. And then I got my nails appointment and uh no I love it because because then we literally probably could launch this early next week like um I mean if we get it done earlier Friday Saturday we could but I think I'm traveling this weekend I'm going go see my sweetheart and he's taken to me to a football game so I'm I'm being out of pocket for a few days or not see your sweetheart what he doesn't live where you live where does he live no he's in Arizona Vegas he's got a few different houses but generally Arizona Vegas gotcha gotcha I used to have a house in Arizona Vegas in my real estate days when I was flipping luxury homes um so okay so is Monday feasible if you want to do what's um Monday's always kind of rough for me anyway because I have a lot and I'm not getting in until like one o'clock in the morning so let's do Tuesday okay that's cool and what we can do uh yeah so I'll start on the google doc and we'll just refine it refine it and uh this will be some gosh I'm even thinking maybe I think, well, so a lot. We got to maybe limit it so we make sure that it's good.
01:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As we get clear on it, once you set an intention and you get really clear on it, people magically and it's not magically, it's synergistic, and I think it's God. But it's asking you shall receive, and you can call it lot of attraction, doesn't matter, once you get clear on it, things just start happening. So if somebody comes along and you're like, I have this perfect offer for you, and you're want to sell it, just sell it, and then we'll fulfill it and we'll figure out the details. I'm just saying, in that amount of time, knowing you and the conversations that you have and because we got clear, there may come an opportunity where you're just like, I could sell this to this person right now, sell it, get paid, we'll fulfill it, we'll deal with money up later.
01:23:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Yeah. And then also just go back to the thing about Seth and this counseling, yeah, like I know my friend Cindy Mulcaney, she loves Seth and I I remember she thought Seth's thing, that's why I bought it. And she said she was going to see that's an interesting person for me to reach out to. She never launched it. Like, she wanted to launch the thing like Seth. And she's doing other stuff, don't be wrong. She's making money and doing good stuff. But I just got a feeling it's like her, that would be a perfect client, too, because it's like, I mean, it launched it. Like, you said you're going to do it. You bought one Seth thing, all excited about it. And instead, she went all down the path of the AI, which is still good. And she's offering some kind of AI coaching offer, and a go high level affiliate. But still, it's sort of like, you know, she believed in something and then she never launched it. So what happened? we're here to go in for helping people in between that.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I think that's the issue. So people have been Yes, it is. It's doubt and it's too much work, and I need help. I don't know how to hire people. Seth can't hire people. Seth cannot manage a business.
01:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He can't. He will never happen.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not talking bad about him. His genius is just he cannot, will not do it. He will jump to all kinds of other things in order to avoid actually structuring things. And he doesn't even know where to start. And so literally saving him. And we don't, we see people like that and we don't know because we see their strengths. But that's the truth is that most people are thinking and so beneath their potential because they need support of some sort. So here's, we could do $10,000 done for you. And here's why I think that would be a good thing. We could take that money, put it into getting support in a person building an automation. But then we're building a snapshot at the same time that we own. So we give them their version of it and then we keep a generic version of it. Doesn't have their copy, doesn't have their anything. But, so I don't think we build too much work for ourselves if we do that for you, because we can whip out, like I can write copy, we could just literally talk about an offer, the copy will come out of my mouth.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm pretty sure you could do the same thing if we do some research.
01:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we would literally just have to transcribe it and then go have it edited into it, it'd be so easy. We could do the same thing with the email follow-up sequences, like we could spend maybe 10 hours for $10,000, you and I would both be well paid. You'd have enough money for a couple of months, comfortably, well, if you got it all, if you didn't, we have it one month and we could sell anyway. So I'm just telling you, those are some options to think about, because I know you know people, and I think God is going to give you, I think he's going to show you who you need to talk to and who you can help. So, you're not allowed own. You're not doing all the work. You're not going to be overburdened. If the person that you know needs this is available, sell it, take the money, get paid, know that you're taking terms, we will fulfill it very quickly.
01:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. Okay, let's go. So, send me the recording when it's ready, when I have time, that'd be great. So I could take a look at the notes and I'll create the Google Doc. I'll have that done by the end of the day today for sure. Okay. have to craft it, not like done done.
01:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will go to do that right now and then launch my missionary meeting because this is devotional so I want the prayers and all that goodness.
01:27:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. All right, all right, talk to you later.

Okay, hello. Ah, this visible table for, we're just setting for this. Oh, did I, and I'm going to invite you? That's what I was trying to do, share in Maria. There we go, share. So logging to Trello and yeah, yep, yep, yep.
00:00:27 - Maria Gudelis
And then we can start setting up.
00:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you had a something that you put, okay, so here, okay, um, well, we already have the business HQ. So, and not like all of our rocks, but we can create things that are specific to that project there, or we can just create a board in here. That's about that. We'll see how it goes. The systems and the teams have to be matched up, so it always just kind of depends on.
00:01:00 - Maria Gudelis
what we have a home to start with so let's let's be in the business HQ and you're okay I'm in that now business HQ yeah yeah you see how I added the graphic yeah I was like she'd be proud of me as I first trailer post I yeah I replied yeah yeah yeah you did yes tagged you in it I love that one here let's discuss tomorrow whoo-hoo hey how come I didn't see that notification should have got an email and also Trello does have an app for mobile yeah I do see that oh you use Trello on your mobile device I yeah because I don't get a lot of stuff with notifications I don't let things happen but if it's work-related I want to know time sensitive stuff yeah I got okay
00:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so your kind of driving things with the having created this new offer and it having things so it would probably be better to figure out what you want to do, where you want to go and lend support to that rather than we basically are shifting gears. So, we've got to figure out what's happening now. So, you have a master class that you're doing Saturday?
00:02:36 - Maria Gudelis
Yep, yeah, to Saturday, yeah.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A board? No, that's not what Read the board. The board title. in the workspace, you know, it's a part that I want to create, a list, hold on, table, I don't use this very often, so I'm having to, like, work for setting workspace views, table calendar, I don't want to do that, go back. Oh, add a card, how do I just create a new list, copy list, move list, archive list, is there, like, a list limit? Let just do that. this. Well, I'll just do this. Um, I duplicate it? I card. No, no, I don't see where I can just add a new list.
00:04:18 - Maria Gudelis
Each of these things are called lists.
00:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm, copy list now. Okay, I've got that. So now I'm just going to Okay. Okay. And So, Big Rocks, we need to change this on a screen share.
00:05:04 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, great.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so Big Rocks, one, three high level done for you done with your clients, hybrid coaching group, DIY coaching. I mean, we could just change this could be the same, but this could be YouTube, but how, how are you envisioning the work that we're doing moving forward? So one of the things that I see as a potential is, so you said, let's just add this as a separate rock building, not this product, but I don't know how much time it takes to build, manage, and support the project, the product. Um, YouTube as a strategy. e to be able to drive traffic to if we were going to, the hybrid coaching group was about marketing and business all together, right? So business growth through, so there's the marketing and sales, but then there's also the systems and the teams and we were merging.
00:06:17 - Maria Gudelis
So would the buyers of the YouTube stuff then be natural? Yes, essential clients for that then?
00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah, they would. And the other way around as well. Yeah. So they work really well together and either of them could be first, but you're already talking to people about YouTube every day, so kind of. The biggest thing is I'm concerned, I want to make sure that we stay focused on whatever that we're doing because it was small ticket offers and if it's like, if you get excited about something new or you can spend a lot of time doing that, like,
00:07:00 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, because I will get distracted and that will frustrate me and I'll probably have to disengage completely. Got it. Got it. Got it.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does serve everything. So, and you're excited about it.
00:07:14 - Maria Gudelis
And that's really important.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like there was a lot of just burnt out by the response that you were getting from people that really wanting. Like, like your low ticket, not just that low ticket as a strategy that you're teaching, they were, you know, like Joe and other people wanting you for basement prices.
00:07:37 - Maria Gudelis
Well, totally like this other guy right now is like, like one guy was like, how much are your ads and like if you wanted me to do ads for low ticket and I was like 2500 plus 10% which is I think extremely fair.
00:07:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he's like, well, I know another guy is willing to do for 1500 plus 10%. But I'm pretty standard right now, even for some of the biggest players.
00:07:59 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Oh, then let them hire them, honestly, because that, you know, yeah.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, because it's like, yeah, exactly.
00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, yeah, because like then that person probably 1500 is not doing anything about the offer or anything else is just pure ads. but yeah, I don't want the either or hell, yeah, for you or not. Whereas the real estate guy, you know, he didn't blink at the five K a month and then he seems really happy and had a good meeting with me the day. So, you know, probably having two more clients like him because they're going to need both our services to scale, you know. So I think what happened is you're right. I probably got burned out by all that. I saw a quick success with YouTube. I see YouTube as a superstructure for a low ticket offer or like our mid ticket offer that could scale. I think that's where that came from.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I think there's more to than that. I think that I think you're extroverted in my opinion. I could be wrong about that. But think that you draw energy from other people. But likewise, they draw energy from you. And I mean, you put a woohoo and everything and people need that.
00:09:19 - Maria Gudelis
There's a lot that you bring to it.
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that it's around not just marketing, but a marketing channel where you get to connect with people in a full personality, but also video so much more leverage because of the way that you can connect. It used to be that it was harder to fake, but now with AI, and really dumb people who can't tell the difference. But pretty soon, AI is probably going to be difficult to detect for almost all of us. The biggest thing that it will have a hard time replicating will be very outgoing personalities. it can't even come close to replicating me right now. I'm sure that it cannot come close to replicating you right now. But anyway, so what I think that it does is it allows you a reset or whatever audience that you have to, you know, they can either form new opinions or they can just go away because you're getting a whole new set of audience and eyeballs, which is good. I think you do that. like I said, it so I told you before, one of my strategies is I like to do one thing that serves multiple purposes. So YouTube, we just talked about let you socialize and engage regularly at a at a kind of high level, especially if one of the challenges that you do is like do a video challenge. There are so many people who make videos on a daily basis that have huge TikTok followers and things like that, because I did a video challenge like 11. ago. I don't make videos. They make videos all the time. were so shy, they were so reserved, and now they use video as their main, um, image, their, their main traffic source. And because I did a video challenge, and I, I love that. But one of the things you can do too is ask people like, um, ask a question, but have them respond in video. So you're, you're pulling people out. Anyway, one thing that does multiple things, it lets you engage with people.
00:11:27 - Maria Gudelis
It resets and merges your audience.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We need, no matter what offer we're doing, low cost, highly targeted leads. Exactly. It also gives us a complimentary offer. If we did the whole, you know, business growth strategy, which we may not want to do, you may just want to focus on this. And then we use, um, you know, business and systems to make their YouTube strategy and their business better. Right. So, of just the whole marketing in general. Yeah, when that we do do YouTube traffic strategies. And if you want to upgrade to higher level coaching, we'll also offer you systems and team support, because the more that you grow, the more support you're going to need. So there's all kinds of ways that that it can work out.
00:12:22 - Maria Gudelis
We just need to make a plan and stick to it.
00:12:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keeping in mind that there's always evolution. Like there's room forever, but the big rocks, which is the point of the big rocks is they don't they don't really change. Everything that is done supports that. But we're still kind of new in this. And so it makes perfect sense. And like I said, I really do think that you need the purge and the reset very much. Yeah. Like you said, it is very leverage. You've been doing it based off of numbers, looking at the statistics. It's converting to sales. It's not Hey, I'm having fun, shiny object, getting leads and followers, but they're not actually converting to money. And I'd be concerned about it. But it's making sales just something that we just had kind of fizzled out, right? For well?
00:13:18 - Maria Gudelis
Oh, no, I just never used YouTube for years.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you driving traffic to right now is making sales. Like you were, you said it, it's made you money. Yeah, into selling.
00:13:31 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, a couple of things. So in the description, I have a few links. One is a link just to buy $500 one hour consult with me go straight to a counseling link. And to go about that, I was like, Holy , like, like, like, like, awesome, like, you know, from watching the videos, uh, and then I also haven't gone to the school group. And the school group now is five bucks a month or $25, um, paid for the annual year. people are buying that, like, whether it be one or two or three. today. Like I'm like, wow. Um, and then I have resell rights is something else that's $900.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's called, well, it's that digital growth community member, Michelle O'Neill stuff.
00:14:10 - Maria Gudelis
And so I sent them to a, um, I credit myself 100 free digital offers leave magnet. And once they get that, then it leaves them, Hey, if you're a really beginner at this, this is a fantastic program to join. It gives you resell to a whole funnel. Sorry.
00:14:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry. My brain. I just, I needed to wait. It wanted to come out. So in my brain, my brain had thought my mouse should have kept it shut for a minute. But YouTube profits for offer owners and affiliates. Yes.
00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's also very specific.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't, I'm gonna go google that right now and see what comes up. YouTube profits for offer. One second. Well, first of all, there's no Google suggests. You see this?
00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I go to this, YouTube profits for offer, so owners and affiliates.
00:15:16 - Maria Gudelis
Was that a good thing or bad? You said there was no suggests.
00:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, well, so there's no, there's no competition for that particular keyword. But if we do YouTube profits, that should be a very broad keyword with how we not see how many pages it is like we used to be able to.
00:15:41 - Maria Gudelis
Oh, yeah. don't know. I wonder if it'll show up on my Google because on Canada, it'll be different. But you just Google YouTube profits.
00:15:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There it is. hundred. It's just the most covered.
00:15:51 - Maria Gudelis
A hundred and eighty-four million results.
00:15:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, of course, creative. We'll say we'll see what happens for a course.
00:16:00 - Maria Gudelis
There's a lot of them coming up here, isn't it?
00:16:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not giving me results again. tools. Oh, there it is. 23,600,000 and for course creators and coaches, we'll say I have to quit tools. Now we're 20 million. How these course creators build profitable businesses. So I'm going make online as a content creator or coach. Let's see. She's quite, not talking to you. So she's got 529,000 subscribers and this has 14,000 views. 41 comments, 703 likes. And it's on YouTube, but it doesn't necessarily say it's about using YouTube to do that. Okay, this is a year ago. YouTube is one quiet. YouTube will start paying creators for course content in 2024. 622,000, 13,000 views, 865 upvotes. Anyway, that particular keyword, I think, it's long tail, but I think it would be really good. And for the domain, it could be IT profits or creators and affiliates or, I don't know, or YT affiliate profits or something like that. I don't know, we'd have to play around chat. TPT is really good about coming up with some descriptions for that. You could also have two domains, right? So you could have the long tell keyword domain. And it's one that you actually do the drive the traffic to. Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. That makes sense.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you don't have Google likes than keywords. And then if everything on the page is relative, and actually, you know, not keyword stuffed, but it's really like, this is exactly how it works. And it's logical flow and things like that. So, um, what time is it? Okay. So big rocks. Um, let's just pretend that we're having a brand new conversation from scratch about what we want to accomplish between now through the end of January, knowing that right now you've got a client engaged. Yeah. Um, and so do we want to have something strategically where you're So putting out and maybe it's once a week or something like this about, hey, just a reminder, we've got this offer going, we're looking for a couple of people, whatever, and see if we attract people or we just ascend them through whatever's happening through the YouTube stuff. That's possible too. just let nature take its course in terms of whether or not we get a higher ticket client that can help fund everything while we build something smaller out.
00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis
Maybe, maybe not do that, like let nature take its course on naturally some people might come to us for a bigger funnel build, but maybe more for weeks I would then kind of get back on social media or we could put something together for that only because, you know, I did advertise, hey, only taking one client, right?
00:19:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I took him, I did say to him, hey, I was being for real, are you going to, you know, pay the rest of this because as I do. I'm on board.
00:20:02 - Maria Gudelis
That's all you need say. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So he'll make more sense if it's four weeks later than I advertised for another quarter. If I were to do it now, it would make, yes.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now we're looking, I mean, because it's end of October, so we could look at not starting that until December or end of November prepping into December. What makes sense to you there?
00:20:23 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, I think end of November prepping for December. Yeah, and like the original thing be what we talked about where we're sending them to like a video sales letter that you and I are on and we walk them through the framework, what they're going to get, we'll make it very clear, and then hey, if you want this book a call for us and we make them pay 100 bucks for the call so we don't waste time.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so that really only gives us like two or three weeks to create something like that if we're targeting mid November, or we said end of November, end of November. Okay, so that gives us a few weeks to VSL, Maria and Tina, COOO, COO, CMO offer. Okay. Do we want to change this?
00:21:23 - Maria Gudelis
Get rid of it. Hybrid coaching group. If we were to do that, you think that's more like for first quarter 2025?
00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would probably be better timing. Yeah, so we'll see. And then this as well, because it's basically just a lower version, and that will kind of create itself from that, be siphoned off of the higher one, so Q1. So then we're going to bump those two down. So, what, what. do you want to put here? Like, you're already doing a masterclass. If you are going to plan out what you'd like to do through, let's say mid-January, right? Because whatever you're doing, there should be some kind of climax that piques about new year goals, right? So you don't and it's going to last through the first week to three weeks of January. So let's say through the first month of Q1, you've been imagining what that looks like or just kind of talking about it and doing it rather than making a plan.
00:23:50 - Maria Gudelis
Talking about it and doing it. I'll be right back just getting the dog is going. Hold on second.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep trying. Okay.
00:24:12 - Maria Gudelis
I mean, the general idea honestly was just like, yeah, let's just get this done taught, put together of course, sell via on-demand webinar for 197 or that's sort of what the process was, but you mean like talking to other people about new year stuff like that or what do you mean or just no, no, I mean, whatever we're selling, there is going to be a new year correlation that helps us make you've got Black Friday offers. I would imagine you also do a new year offers. Yeah, yeah, usually you speak group coaching, yeah, yeah.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so sell course via webinar.
00:25:04 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, I have to put a pencil on that, like whether it's like that via just a standalone webinar or whether I'm like a low ticket funnel or whether there's a $7 thing and the thing that I'm creating now like this Saturday and next week becomes like the upsell one for $197 to a $7 offer.
00:25:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me I'll add again real quick.
00:25:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Yeah. So the two options are, so of course, one by seven via webinar or sell a low ticket funnel. You have any specificity to put here? Yeah, we're $7 that go is front end.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's go F E.
00:25:48 - Maria Gudelis
then OTO one is $197.
00:25:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what the $7 version is?
00:26:00 - Maria Gudelis
No, it could just simply be 101 templates, like video hooks, templates. Yeah.
00:26:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what's this?
00:26:18 - Maria Gudelis
The OTO one is this thing we're creating the, it was the YouTube fast track or launchpad, but yeah, the YouTube profits. Oh, like it, because we changed the name profits for affiliates. Offer owners and affiliates.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. um, basically, it is. Laying. research? If you could bullet point the things in your process, what would it be?
00:27:13 - Maria Gudelis
So I know the research, I know maybe taking notes, maybe the scripts, like what are some of the... Yeah, yeah, so the research and then the planning, the content, yeah, the script per video, I don't necessarily do a full script, like word for word, but the outline for the video, and then the next thing would be the recording of the video, including the script for the video, that includes the tags, the title.
00:27:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna make that separate. Because that's its own strategy Okay Don't you think like so you write the content and maybe it's Research and then maybe it's tags. What did you see tags and titles?
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, and then content planning should be around the tags and title because you're research because those are the things right that get you Yeah, you're right people matched Like the video packaging if you want to call that is yeah, you're you're you're thumbnail The subject like the title of the video and I would say tags as well. Yeah, that the video packaging cuz yeah Tells you goes out YouTube's algorithm What it's about and gets you found in the traffic and what you say in the video If you know some of those keywords if you say that in the video that helps too if you go to I'll put up another tab and go to fast digital wealth.com forward slash yt I have a graphic in there that Shows five phases phases. was intending to kind of just use as a framework to teach the masterclass And again, it's not stuck in stone, you know, because I kind of do these things just to get it going Try um, h to do p s w w w I can shove the link in it already is Maybe it's not h tps Fastest a little Anyway, copy. I'll put it in the chat here.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said dot com right?
00:29:32 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, it's in the chat there I think I think I have to fix the domain to have it allow the it without the www. think that's just a minor tech issue Okay So if you scroll all way down, there's a graphic that shows five There there's a little further up Yeah, everything with the white like, go, yeah, there, one more, phase one, phase two, phase three. If you scroll a little bit up, you'll see the title, there you go. So, funness analysis, which is, and then record.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this in that. Hello. What do you want to call this? Was that what to call it? So, I'll put this here, oh my gosh, good.
00:30:56 - Maria Gudelis
Okay. you.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. you. I have a hundred and fifteen percent of my psychology course so far.
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis
A hundred and fifteen percent?
00:31:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:31:08 - Maria Gudelis
That you've done?
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's extra credit, so that's my grade.
00:31:12 - Maria Gudelis
Awesome, congrats.
00:31:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
all my scores were perfect, except I missed two on one quiz. Well, two points, one question. Anyway, I'm in... I'll go from the future. Downwinds. Oh my gosh, did I go to desktop? There it is. Oh, hush. oof, Why don't you want that? just want the image. Okay, save. Okay, go. Um, so... Does... Oh, F for IDB, quiet. Let me go back to trouble. Where was it? I'm in it. Don't be dumb. Is that really where I wanted to go? That is where I wanted to go. Oh, I was in big rocks. One second. Hey. Aphrodite. I'm trying to work. Let's go. Get it out. Thank you. This is Barbara. That's the neighbor's dog. Okay. Oh, yeah. Did I not save it? Did it not save? Yes, it did. Okay. I just saved. Okay. to save it now. Okay. Edit. So, YouTube's strategy for getting happy target leads and then weird. and that's weird that um that's like a Skype uh favicon it's weird oh for system IO yeah that's their favicon yeah oh okay yeah i mean i'm normally click on those gal but i'm trying to figure out system IO so that's why i put it there but we can move everything into your go high level if you want i have a go high level as well yeah um let's see phase one address how this is different than all the other okay you know you two courses out there that i've steered you wrong and wasted ton of your pressure to be shocked as how many it's easy to install i mean this is fast ad copy i just slapped it for sure um phase three takes a lot of chaos i'm going look at the traffic and sales save time higher Okay, phase five shows you how to save time, I'll switch into a five dollar VA. Okay, and how many people are signed up to your master class?
00:34:19 - Maria Gudelis
I think I've got definitely 10, let me see if there's been more, let me just sign in and look. And like the Friday will be the deadline, so I probably will get more on Thursday Friday. Let's go sales models.
00:34:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One thing to consider is that if your offer is about eyeballs and traffic and you have a low attendance on a webinar, that might sound, that might, I don't know, because you're just promoting that webinar to Facebook, right?
00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis
10. I think it's 10. Yeah, I think it's exactly. Sorry, I was trying to answer your first question about how many. So, uh, I think one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, I think it's exactly 10. I think I'm next. Look, 11, 12, 14, 15. Is that me? Is that me? my voice.
00:35:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I keep forgetting.
00:35:31 - Maria Gudelis
don't know. Or if you're just giving me your PayPal email, I'll just pay you.
00:35:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not at proffereddriversink.com.
00:35:38 - Maria Gudelis
There you go. email for everything. Okay, okay. I'll send it that way.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Be profit drivers, girl.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're awesome. Um, so that's just the thing is, but, so, but were you only promoting that master class to Facebook? You weren't promoting that on YouTube, were you?
00:35:59 - Maria Gudelis
No, It's to cool traffic.
00:36:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that sales page sucks.
00:36:03 - Maria Gudelis
Okay, that's what I wanted to get that.
00:36:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the only thing I was going is like, if you're talking about, Hey, I get lots of traffic from YouTube, and then you don't have a lot of attendance on the webinar, that would be that would seem like weird. But if it's like, Hey, you guys have been following on Facebook and I just wanted to show you what I'm doing. And it gets some sales. But like, clearly, I've only been doing it a little while. And they know that.
00:36:25 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, it's something why people know me that I always do a cheap masterclass before launching a bigger course, like in like five years ago, I did the same strategy for selling a course about how to do challenges. So hey, you want me to do workshop on how to do challenges? And I did 97, I sold 30 of them. And then after that, that $97 product masterclass evolved into a $500.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a thought. And I'm going to say it. And sometimes things come out sounding rude. And I don't mean it to be, but I just had a thought.
00:36:58 - Maria Gudelis
So I'm not going to filter.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It thinking about branding because you said this is what triggered it for me is that you said that people know that you'll put out a masterclass in the beginning.
00:37:10 - Maria Gudelis
I think what also people know is you bounce around from different things from time to time. That is true. Yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's what I'm thinking about is like depending on who you want to attract, right? the jack of all trades might attract the jack of all trades. There's a difference in in in value perception between a generalist and a jack of all trades. They're the same except for a generalist has a strategy about knowing all the things and they'll still generally put it toward a specific type of thing. So I'm very much a generalist but my my expertise is using that general knowledge towards optimized business growth, optimize sustainable business growth in a joyful business. You know what I mean? Yeah. So that is that is a general view. That is not a general skill. There's so many different things involved in that. So I can be talking about AI, but I'm going to be talking about AI in the realm of growing business strategically leveraged, optimized, sustainable, joyful. Make sense? Yep. So if people hire level people that are want to spend a lot of money that would spend a lot of money, see you as a person who can't possibly be an expert because you're jumping around to all the different things, never really staying and putting in 10,000 hours, you know, per se, whatever's in their brain.
00:38:50 - Maria Gudelis
This is not my judgment, right? But this is that area.
00:38:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So maybe we consider changing the branding and putting out the language. of hey you guys have seen me be doing you know this thing that thing because one thing that I am is I'm always a student I'm always a teacher I'm always a marketer and in that vein I've done these things in the past but really I'm an expert marketer and it helps you know to state who you are how are they going to know if you don't tell them yeah and and that goes back to the pedigree and the authority post of this is what I've done what you see is what I get excited about because this is social media and I'm being social talking about these things yeah what you don't know is I've done this and this and this and this and clearly this is what I'm focused on and I'm working with you know another systems at like another business growth expert who focuses primarily on systems and teams but is also amazing at market. marketing and that kind of thing so but but I think that you should always think about what are people thinking when they're looking at you and what are your the people that you you're like your ideal clients the ones that would pay the most the ones that you learn the most from the ones that you want to maybe do profit sharing with what are they thinking when they see what you're putting out there just something to think about and if it matters so to me it's a long-term leverage play to always know like what are other the high leverage people thinking when they see it yeah I also am I don't care who thinks what I'm just gonna be me and you know teach and do whatever but I do but there's wisdom that I've learned in considering those things because I have the best opportunity to serve my people when when I'm leveraged, when I'm making good money, when I'm working with very smart, high level people. So I need to make sure that they're aware that I'm out there and that they know what I'm capable of. So those opportunities come so that I keep sharpening my saw and up leveling, you know what I mean? they need to know that I'm out there and what I'm so anyway just something to think about is like who there's an audience that you serve and there's the uh not the stalkers but what are they the the lurkers. The lurkers are the high dollar payers that never say anything but DM you and say hey look I've seen you. I've been like I've got money you know I mean? They they operate very differently but I but I I want you to always think about what are the lurkers thinking when they want to.
00:42:03 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, hi dollar lurkers. Got it. Yeah, even Alan's text of the other day. Well, you know, marketing, Maria, like, you know, it's like, yeah, I think just saying marketing expert maybe is is the maybe the brand name, which is very good also the marketing expert or something.
00:42:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. Yeah. And and and and that you can be like, I like to play in the different channels. You know, I like to, I like to play with the different, um, I don't know what you would call it. It's not the channel, but the like a VSL versus a landing page versus email. Like that's not really, maybe that's a channel. Not a platform. I third, I don't know. Channels and methods.
00:42:52 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a firm believer in that. Like it doesn't doesn't assign me. I know. think you're a firm believer.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to any of these methods work, whether it's low ticket or whatever, it's just how you then attack it and what you're at the end of the day, it's you're offering your messaging, you know, how leveraged it is. So like you you're working and you're focusing on YouTube right now because it's getting super leveraged results. It's free, they're highly targeted and they're turning in the buyers.
00:43:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:43:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So nothing can beat that. Justin Brooke, lots of Dan will tell you nobody beats YouTube for cost for leads.
00:43:37 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:43:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the last couple of years, nobody has YouTube for cost for leads. Facebook ads. So, you know, just just something to be talking about like why, why YouTube, why are you doing this? It's not a shiny object and maybe even speaking to the elephant in the room. Hey, you might think like I'm a shiny object. like I'm always chasing different things, but really what it is is I'm a marketing expert and I love to study the channels, and I like teach people along for the ride with me. So you're speaking to the elephant in the room, but it's also the lurkers, like hey, yeah, yeah, always a little embedded message for them.
00:44:20 - Maria Gudelis
Well, yeah, I mean, I think if we were having this conversation three weeks ago, I didn't think I would have really a YouTube course, but the videos, like, yeah, it's crazy. This one video has now got that I published, I'm looking at the stats here on September 28th. So a month ago today, or two days ago, month ago, 17,784 views and 66 comments, and then another video that doesn't have as many views, but still doing too bad, let's see, scroll down to it. This was from October 17th, so like two weeks ago, has 3,680 views, 39 comments, all 39 Those are good love karma comments like so much value. You're so authentic. And the people that bought the $500 console calls with me, I asked them, which particular video do you remember that you watch? Oh, hang on, I actually saved it. She goes and and looks at it tells me it's the one where he said, you drew on the whiteboards with three circles and everything. And that's the one that has 3,680.
00:45:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should just come visit me and we just just stay here for a week and let's make a lot of content together.
00:45:26 - Maria Gudelis
Yes, so fun.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I've got the kids, so I can't really trouble. then like, but we could do dual videos like we could use Riverside and like like like this relates to the podcast.
00:45:38 - Maria Gudelis
We want to start to I saw a podcast today, but I thought, Oh, that's the name similar to what we would probably love to have. It had something about I think it had the word success growing your company, but it was it. He no longer has a podcast. He switched it to inputs only. He changed the podcast name to inputs only. But before it, it had something to do with the word success. Um, scaling, but also or growing, but also, like, just living your life. forget, oh, I wish I wrote it down, but, you know, me, a little bit of a podcast geek when I'm driving. I'll just come to listen to various ones, but I was thinking, Oh, that'd be good one for us.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cause yeah, we would have a blast cause I'm already, you know, my energy was people would have a blast listening. I can't tell you how many people are like, you should write a book. should have a podcast and like, I don't want to, but to talk to you, it's just yeah, and even, even just the strategy of how you're analyzing the sales page and the name and the knowledge is like, if we had recorded that, that would be gold for people. Are we still recording?
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis
That we're, yeah, yeah, we did. We did. We do have a record. I mean, but we could actually just do like, Hey, we know we're going to record it. We could actually just do it like a play by play of, here's what we did.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And here's, yeah, so, but that could be repurposed. Even from Fathom, if we ever like, you know, that was old. So we've got the audio. And also, it records to my computer.
00:47:03 - Maria Gudelis
always cancel it and don't do it, but if you go like save that, we want to hide that.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you know, we might not be dressed appropriately or whatever. So we can use an image and it can have, you know, how it has the sound thing that's going while the person's talking.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis
Yes.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can have that and then we can have like a slide on the back or screen share. So there would be more video editing, but if we get a good video at the that's low cost, that we can just say, Hey, this is what I want you to do. This was the highlight. This was the section. We can pre-preperate in like this script or something like that because then we can very easily edit down to the very specific clip that we want. And then just say, Okay, here's her image. There's my image. This is what we want you to see. These are the screenshots that we want you to put at this time stamp, this time stamp, then it's time stamp, then you've got an excellent video and you can
00:48:00 - Maria Gudelis
you know we could do talking head over it like hey we just wanted to introduce this topic we were talking we did this and then so maybe it's a 20 second clip of us introducing it but we're like on camera and then i love it i love it yeah no i mean because we energized each other like i was my energy was fading you know an hour ago and then now i'm like all excited again that's how i get when i talk to you yay i was already in a good place because i just came from my mission thing but for sure when i'm like and then Maria was like hey hey yeah yeah but also and and also the other reasons for doing this you too i gotta say is that um and i don't know if i've told you this because like we haven't really chatted like this for a while but i think i said this to one of my other friends um who like we've we've been business partners even years ago and she's a good friend for the last like you know 10 years and i just had care like you know both of us have been doing facebook ads for clients since 2000 12 like I think we've because of that and because we're still damn good at it We've had blinders on because I I can't believe over the last you know a few weeks the YouTube stuff that's happening And the sales coming in I mean like it and it just still is growing whereas in Facebook if we do a video You know unless you keep putting ad spent on it. It's dead.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It goes into a desert of no eyeballs Oh in Hamza Fez He's a cancer survivor.
00:49:31 - Maria Gudelis
he said one good YouTube video live YouTube video will outperform every single Facebook post of an entire year Wow Yeah, and I believe that now and and so crazy because I've been in all this blinders and Even all the groups have been in and more like create your offer do adds to it Like I've been for since 2012 when I started my first maybe it's 11 when I first saw my first Facebook ads Learning from Frank that they had to do ads. So that is like over a decade of just fricking on only one racetrack of traffic. Owen Hemsa. Okay, yeah. Oh, look at that. Even on YouTube channels for high-performance professionals. Oh, here go.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now people, you know, you remember when QR codes came out and everybody was like, this is not gonna last, this doesn't work, and it's gonna take a while. Now is the time to use them. Now, almost everybody knows how to use them. They're not nearly as glitchy. And without doing a URL, and just with the click of a camera, and especially if they can make them clickable now, that's the biggest thing is, because most people are taking a picture on their phone. I just use my phone on there to go to a site now. Yeah, yeah, I mean, he definitely gets marketing. He's got the charisma. He beat cancer naturally after chemo almost beat him. So he's special. He's out. up there. But he's definitely doing the numbers and knows the stats and things like that and I think that you'll enjoy him. But yes, we can be in an echo chamber, we can just be cutting off the ends of the turkey to make it fit in the pan and we don't know why you've got to do that.
00:51:20 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, and hey, listen, I'm on his side looking as a fractional CMO service.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's interesting. And without me knowing about him, like, yeah, this does dovetail nice in the pocket CMO CMO service. It does because it is marketing and it's a very specific channel and strategy. But I don't know of one that beats it. So if anybody's going to be doing CMO work for somebody, they should be going about YouTube.
00:51:49 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, interesting.
00:51:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you said we're not meeting tomorrow, you have plans tomorrow?
00:51:56 - Maria Gudelis
I got my hair cut. Yeah, I got my hair cut in the afternoon. Let me look up the counter tomorrow, what time it's at, that was the only time she's available, she takes forever to put it.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The only thing I have on Friday is once with a friend.
00:52:12 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, but well, the haircut is at 1230. So I can be home right now, our meeting is for 230. Sorry, our meeting is at 130. I could be home, 130. If we were to could push it to one hour later, then I have a call with Dan, then got it. I can do it after my call with Dan. Yeah, we could do that.
00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's, it gets done at one o'clock my time, and I would need, you know, just a few minutes in between, make sure I eat, keep my blood sugars like crashing right now. And it happens more often because I'm trying to keep it, you know, stable, but it, it crashes.
00:52:58 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah, yep, yep. Let me get Hold on. Hold on.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay.
00:53:03 - Maria Gudelis
So I'm going to be happy with me, Tina.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why? Why?
00:53:32 - Maria Gudelis

00:53:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do that. I will just drag it. And it should have sent you an email.
00:54:01 - Maria Gudelis
Oh, it didn't just change the English language.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, did it do it to all of them?
00:54:06 - Maria Gudelis
I don't. I don't.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hope it did not.
00:54:09 - Maria Gudelis
I don't think so.
00:54:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it didn't. Just that one. Okay. I just like clicking drag.
00:54:16 - Maria Gudelis
I don't know if I like that, eh? Yep. I see it now. I'll accept it. Yes.
00:54:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then tomorrow we can put some more bones on this.
00:54:27 - Maria Gudelis
Yep. That was fun. Pardon the pun, since doggy bone just went away from Merlin.
00:54:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. So yesterday, ooh, I got to send you this picture.
00:54:37 - Maria Gudelis
Hold on.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to drive it. I can send it through a voxer. So much easier with text to send images, but you will probably really appreciate this. Don't know what's on top. Voxer. Maria. Oh, yeah. That's right. So let's chat. Maria. I sent that to my sweetheart because we went to Joanne's fabric yesterday because my daughter loves to sew.
00:55:09 - Maria Gudelis
Oh my girl.
00:55:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. And we saw these guys there. Did you get image?
00:55:17 - Maria Gudelis
And I... told them to go look.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:55:21 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah.
00:55:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The skeleton skeleton. And then I said, said, I had to make him pay attention. It was funny. I know I love it. And then he cracked up and he's like, you're so goofy. And I'm like, I know I'm freaking hilarious.
00:55:49 - Maria Gudelis
I love it.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then she left it on the couch last night and scared the crap out of me. So I was like, his name is Frank.
00:55:58 - Maria Gudelis
Frank. Frank.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It's in duck and a skeleton dog. Anyway, um, we'll wrap up. So we'll just, um, if you want, we can probably meet Friday as well.
00:56:10 - Maria Gudelis
It just depends on the pace.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It depends on how busy you are and how much you want to get, you know, the structure going.
00:56:16 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Yeah.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we can talk about that tomorrow because Friday is open.
00:56:20 - Maria Gudelis
So let's see what we do tomorrow. Okay.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We might fry our brains tomorrow. We did a lot today already.
00:56:27 - Maria Gudelis
Yeah. Are you excited about it?
00:56:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what? Oh, yeah.
00:56:30 - Maria Gudelis
I think it's going to be great.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's, um, yeah. So that's the other thing. My, my diet, I don't get to eat happy food and I'm, I don't get sugar highs, which really make me happy. So, um, my, my might wane from time to time. It's definitely not that stuff. Like I'm really hot and dizzy right now and I probably need to go eat.
00:56:54 - Maria Gudelis
Okay.
00:56:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You we? Yes. I just want to tell you though. I, I love this.

I I not Don't want to be on camera But I love having conversations and anyway, just have self-confidence issues You know that not in me like and I know people don't care. just don't like seeing myself I used to not be able to tolerate hair in my face and I've gotten over that most of just because people say really nice things about it Which is crazy to me But no, they'll be like you can really good at like reading a book We're like I've sang on video a few times in one lady. She's like I could listen to you in the phone book. I'm like Anyway, so we'll get over it and practice. It's it's just Decentatizing yourself to it.

Two Mark sweets.
00:00:01 - mark sweet
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one was right. So that's all right.
00:00:10 - mark sweet (3)
I just don't know one. They're just down just to one me.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you. That's OK. I just got up with Fuji this back to back meeting. I'm not used to it. And I'm like, I got to go.
00:00:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, he was asking me a question about multiple company names or a different company name for each day. what we have, if that wasn't really helpful. But his situation is a little different than mine because the tracking by a doctor name, not the only reason we have different companies for different states is more because of our trust account and because each day has different laws where it's a little different for him. So I mean, I'm the whole, it's better. But I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like. like um oh so I got to flip something for him. love when people think one thing about their business and then I'm like oh we go do some math and then you find out it's not that at all so July is actually way profitable way more profitable for him than Q and P.
00:01:18 - mark sweet (3)
Good.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool.
00:01:21 - mark sweet (3)
One quick thing from the legal side though just in a facamot, the CUNY practice that's legitimacy to his personal injury stuff.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh I'm not telling him he shouldn't do it. Okay. That was a nice like exciting thing for him to know that July was actually like that.
00:01:38 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah yeah good tea faces.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh you guys always join on video and Fuji he said that it's more intimidating but like accountability so he's like I like when you're there because like I feel like I've got a I don't know pay attention so I think facial expressions which makes a difference rather than just seeing if on the earth. It's not okay.
00:02:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Great.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My face is as crazy as my voice. Hi, Dan. What's up?
00:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan Jeep, my new voice.
00:02:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
My first, my second call.
00:02:18 - mark sweet (3)
voice hasn't warmed up yet.
00:02:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my second call and mine has because I already got excited about nerdy numbers. There you go.
00:02:28 - mark sweet (3)
So this convention was interesting, the lawyer one. Everyone is just super, super, super excited about AI.
00:02:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, God, what don't they know that that ship was already sailed for about two years late? The K guys ship already sailed and sank.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:49 - mark sweet (3)
What's in heaven and has it?
00:02:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
here's what saying, not like it has.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It sounds like how you're talking about it. It's what?
00:02:57 - mark sweet (3)
It's not where it needs to be yet to be. effective. So it's never going to be.
00:03:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's it's it's always going to be about the promise. And say it from the beginning, he who engineers the promise wins. But the adoption rate by, you know, the general public is already on the decline. It only ever really hit 5%. And it's on the decline. So they're like, or this 's not, no one's going to use it. Most people don't even know what it is. They don't even know who the vice president is. And now she's running for president.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They still don't know who she is.
00:03:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She doesn't know. That's fine. And it's like, but, you know, there's the whole strawberry thing that just went around, right? couldn't count the R's and strawberry. It got it. If you ask Chachi B, Chachi Bt4, how many R's are in strawberry? it will tell you to right now. They haven't even fixed it. It's like, you should probably go fix that one. No, it can't do simple things. But that being said, I was talking to this buddy of mine.
00:04:15 - mark sweet (3)
The stuff that we've done that's really interesting is. I like fixed it. Now says the worst draw right contains three R letters.
00:04:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There you go. It literally didn't work yesterday.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it for me?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:04:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See, it's not trustworthy. But if the stuff that we've done that's interesting is giving it the data set. So I think it's called RAG. I think the three letter thing is called RAG. And it's like, you're basically giving it a data set and then using it for its large language modeling against the data set that you trust, that you've said, hey, this is the thing. So it's good at that. And then if you, and if you then have it, you're updating that data set and or you're creating an application with it so that it remembers things and all that good stuff, then you're on another level. Then it can work. But what most people are doing is just like API and into chat, GPT. And it's like, yeah, not great.
00:05:25 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the training the models were people are missing the huge problem. I agree with you, but it's time consuming and boring.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but most people second communicating and the way to make chat GPT work really well is to give excellent parameters. It's not just the prompting. It's the parameters of the prompting. Here are the boundaries. Also, here is the level of effort that you need to apply. So like if you ask at a basic thing, it puts forth basic effort. If you say, I want you to apply it as though you're this person using this logic, there's parameters, right? Completely different type of output. So like it said, there are two R's and I said try again and instead I apologize, there are three R's. So the other thing is you need to build in a check and balance system. So like I just told Fuji, I said go do your reports. I said, but then, because he's like, I'll use chat GPT do this. I said, okay, but then you need to go validate the data and make sure that what it told you is correct. And you can offer it for formulas and things like that. But the other part is most people aren't building in a check and balance system. I mean, have it in our government and not that it works, but whatever. there are also need to be something and that the problem is, and it's the same problem in every kind of business as people don't delegate. They, the hell is the word? You just give it off to people and you forget about it. My brain, I know this word is driving me nuts. Abdicate, people abdicate. So as soon as there is somebody that they think, can or will or something handle a problem for them. It isn't delegation. They just stop thinking about it. That's how embezzlement happens. That's how a lot of things happen. It's because people advocate, oh, this is my person for this. This is my system for this. It works. But we all know nobody and no thing works the same all the time. Life happens, human error, system error, economical error, whatever. So whatever system they build, there needs to be a quality assurance kind of check and balance system that gets built into it and whatever. It's not just about chat TBT and why I'm going off about all of this, but this is the thing that destroys a lot of businesses and a lot of more people when they get to the point where I can pay to delegate. Case in point, Mark, you haven't done anything bad, but I'm just saying this is the thing. You need to be a aware of in yourself don't how to keep the delegation right like we've had issues with our complaints and missing a statute because yeah so dealing with it yeah yeah delegating is one thing advocating is a thing you can't ever do and it has to be the most critical parts like why we why you resist the non-attorney model because attorneys have liability right and it's not just you owning all the liability you have somebody else in there that's got skin in the game and that's important because that that keeps a layer of protection against you strategically and i agree with that so the one interesting thing that keeps coming up and dandy you probably know more about this than i do is they're having these bots listening in on the calls for tonal shifts and for I guess voice for lack of very term is the person sound happy to add positive for us
00:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
some of these things. And obviously they're trying to pressure their problem like flags the call for a manager or supervisor to listen to it, whether it's a training issue or potentially an upset client or what happened.
00:09:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way it's listening to the tone.
00:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
No way.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No disagree with you.
00:09:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they're saying it. It would have to be a third party. They're not doing it.
00:09:25 - mark sweet (3)
They're using something that's already done it. If anything. Yeah.
00:09:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's probably more based on stop words than tone, right? Because just think the individual aspect of people's voices in general, right? how people speak differently. whether it's like people can't even pick out sarcasm text. People can't pick out sarcasm voice. Top words. Words of frustration. Words of anxiety. Words of that all day long. can see that being more effective than. and then looking for a tone or trying to identify tone. It could be a combination of the two, maybe, but I bet it leans more towards the word itself first.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think it's the word. So right now Chat TBT can tell you the tone of words, text. it does that. don't think it's, and also how much you can pick up sarcasm, especially thick sarcasm. I don't know how good it's at that. But the thing is, if people keep it in perspective, and this is what I think most people won't do, which is actually a benefit to all the other people who are going to be smart, is that you take it as a potential data point to go, like basically a flicker to go say, what's happening over here and go listen to it yourself and go, is this right? than I'm going to go and this is a problem person because Chat TBT keeps saying all their people are angry. angry and maybe it just can't even recognize it right or whatever.
00:11:03 - mark sweet (3)
You be able to figure out something like yelling or screaming.
00:11:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's it's going to be in this middleware. They're putting a middleware in place. I don't think that's yeah, I don't think that that's necessarily native to Chad GPT. So, I don't know if it's something else. It is. That's all anyone's using.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we'll see it open AI. That's what Chad GPT is, but it's open AI. it's all it's going to be so interesting, but keeping here's what we're talking We're talking and you're interrupting you.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That don't track anything.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't track anything. It's important to keep everything in containers, but that's what to your point of tracking is it's easier to do when they're in containers. Right. Daniel.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's all sizzle, right? It's typical lawyer , right? Those guys are the most easily sold people on Earth.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's It's unreal.
00:12:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm not very excited by Shawnee Ball. And I have no idea how to implement it, what it actually does in the background.
00:12:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then they're not going to track it. So it's like, you don't even, if you did it, are attracted to what it is? Oh, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm pretty sure you got to have a lot of that to be an attorney, period, or just collectively coming from somebody that was one of my career choices.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
There are multiple more to do this. Coquitos, one, apparently.
00:12:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, Pekker? What?
00:12:52 - mark sweet (3)
a weird name that is.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See you. Yeah, I just thought about it.
00:12:56 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you looking at?
00:13:00 - mark sweet (3)
So, could you use a real-time AI system to analyze the live phone calls that take customer sentiment provide agents with live cushion and feedback, uses voice analysis, introvert motion, infuse like stress or enthusiasm. There's the observed.ai, does kind of the same thing.
00:13:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't think you need a real time, right? you could just find something that allowed you to download recordicals and mass-analyze those to like help nail a script first, right? Like, you know, they don't need like any or support yet, right? If you got a script that worked and you're like, okay, this script is solid. Now, the only way this script goes sideways is through the execution thereof. Therefore, now layer on something where you know it's not gonna try, it's just gonna sort of try to make them be more successful with the script, but maybe.
00:13:55 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe, I mean, the issue, and I'm sure we're coming up is these larger teams, right? Because if you've got, take, for example, and it's alerting you that Marie is not doing a good job for whatever reason, right? You would want someone to listen to it take it over because you could potentially have a large case, right, your hands. Doctors office was calling in super frustrated. You want to know right away rather than after the fact, after the problem.
00:14:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, so like, I like the large case, right? But that would be like a word that could be like a stopboard based thing too, right? It's like, hey, if they say UPS truck, 18 wheeler, you know, you're like, oh, those are like, not stop words, but those are like flag words. Uh oh, this could be a commercial, you know, that kind of thing. But that would be the extracted via the script, right? So there's where the script would come into play to then sort of like was Tina was saying, sort of like what I was saying, you're not writing a prompt, you're just making making data available to the prompt, that's the prompt will say, hey, I can use that. Hey, that's something that I'm supposed to be looking for, and then it does its thing.
00:15:11 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no, I mean, that was one big one. The other big one is, you know, even up does AI demand writing, which I don't know.
00:15:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that I can see for sure.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
Makes sense.
00:15:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But you would do it, you could do that right now, but it's just a matter of you having a self, I mean, it seems like the, and this is what I literally was doing yesterday because, you know, I'm a loser. But I'm like, okay, I can just have the data in the Google sheet in like a row. And I just say, hey, this row. And I keep telling chat GPT, like, I don't need to build the database at this rate, but I need to someplace to store the data and say you're using this. Then it's a matter of like, you give it a demand. Let's say you get, let's. it's a demand for a dog bite or whatever, whatever it is, it's a car accident.
00:16:06 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we do.
00:16:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a car accident. But like, give me an example of one where you'd be like, it's a tip, like the setup where like, this is the demand is based on these four or five things. Like, is there a scenario like that?
00:16:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So you're generally going to have liability. Number one, like, how did it happen? Who's that fault?
00:16:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So you're saying, yeah, injuries and injuries is the part you spend the most amount of time on.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Three state specific, which state did it happen in? And four is the rest of the board of plate template, quite frankly, you know, the terms and conditions and kind of the opening and just the boiler plate template.
00:16:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So you have the first one probably has a fault, not a fault, right?
00:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
it just binary or is there a third? No, there's a third. Okay.
00:17:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you, it's one of the three. And then the next one, so the injury would be the most complicated one, right? You'd have to then go through your database that you have, and litify like, Hey, here are all the possible injuries.
00:17:15 - mark sweet (3)
And then you'd have to build like a sort of matrix, which I can totally see with. Hold on. So when I say injuries, it's pulling from the medical workers of that specific client with what they had.
00:17:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. So, but you'd say, like, Hey, had an MRI. They had this. had that. So what is the number more based on the treatments than the actual injury? Like, Oh, it was their neck MRI. you build like a matrix and say they had MRI, this, this, this, this. And then maybe, and then the prices or whatever are included. So it's like, if you could dynamically say, Hey, like imagine, filling in a form and you're like, it's, it's not at fault, it's MRI, that, that, that, right, select checkboxes. And then it's whatever, whatever the next one is. So they submit the form, that goes in that then temporarily updates the set of fields. then the prompt go, then it hits the prompt and the prompt set, the prompt is written to say, Hey, you're going to look after it's half fault and you're going look at this and you're going to look at these injuries, then go look at this data set that has the injury pricing or whatever, or you're including that price. You're saying it's MRI 5000, it's this, blah, blah, whatever it is. And then the prompt is just waiting for you to give it those parameters. And then it goes and looks at your ideal demand, let's call it, which there's probably an ideal one, right? then boom, you'll write it and then the quick ideally you would write all this and you'd have a demand that's done well to compare it to. You say, okay, if I feed it this data, does the demand that spit out come out like this? Yes or no?
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3)
you see how to train it, like the ones already being written first, hey, mean, this information, no, here's a better example.
00:19:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way you could train that. Then you just start massaging that prompt in the middle.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like what we were having Fuji work on with his reports is feeding the data and the analytical process as much as possible. But then the other thing is the system for sure that should be built in is human approval.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't just get sent out on and so.
00:19:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, well, and you could human score it at the end to go, now that's of three or the lawyer scores. Somebody, somebody that you trust their scoring.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That right there. Mark's score basically for a while, and then train somebody that scores according to your approval. That's the thing for, okay, so going back to the application conversation and just the pace of the technology and the evolution, the innovation that is available right now is leveraged, all of this is AI stuff is leveraged if it's used right, but all of it has to be something that you learn firsthand, everything has to be. For example, okay, so Dan, the foundation of basis really is numbers tell the whole story, so we need to be able to have the numbers. When it comes to online businesses, most of those numbers come through the website, so the analytics. So he's diving into GA4, which is Google Analytics 4, right? It's a whole new beast. We've been using Google Analytics. I've been using it since 2002, probably. I think it was out. Maybe it wasn't that old. Maybe a few years after that. Let's see, 2008, I was getting into split testing. So anyway, we'll say maybe like 2005, people were already starting to use Google Analytics. And now it's an entirely different kind of thing. It's this whole host of a suite, basically, of things that you used to have to get somewhere else. But Google owns all of it. And because it's so new, even the experts are still just kind of figuring out how to use it. So he has a massive leverage opportunity to be an innovator right now, which is a business owner who understands how to tap into Google Analytics. And so he's doing it. He's been studying it for weeks. From an expert who I know personally and I've met and he that's all he's been doing is this this whole time So he's been going growing with it But Dan can't delegate this to anybody right and If he could it would cost it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it The only one he could delegate to would be another expert. So for you with the marketing with the with the AI but also The business the culture all of these things coalesce into Something very unique for you specifically and subsequently sweet law, which does have its own Unique identity and culture, but I'm just saying The things that interest you If it's innovative and leverage the more you spend time on that and getting real data Talking with Dan. I'm kind of helpful with these things Sometimes he spends more time in it. But anyway, um, there, there's a lot of opportunity to at least figure out how we can shave a little time here and there. So we've been talking about the path to growth is optimization and leverage. This is it. If you can improve the script through analysis data, right, with AI, if you can improve, and not just the intake script, but the attorney's want to script two for certain types of scenarios so that they can be handling things more consistently. So like Lorenz for Mike or the case managers, actually, basically everybody, certain scripts for certain scenarios, they feel like they could be trained better to handle specific types of people and scenarios. Because they know their job that people handling is not what their best at knowing the law and case handling is what their best at people handling is a necessary part of managing the case well so like we've been talking about call control scripts or just I brought up the phrase a few times but when I brought it up to runs sorry hold on and when he brought it up to his team they all want training I need to tell you this by the way it was the last last week conversation but so using AI to kind of help us find scripts if you are listening somehow to all the calls in sweet law and can identify who handles inside the team already the best types of people like if we were able to and that we're not here yet I don't think with the AI but something to keep in mind about like best case scenario best use cases would be okay who handles um specific death cases who handles any type of thing or any type of person and they could label it by the language that's used um and then say okay this person does a really great job of handling this type of person like Mike with distributions. So what Mike does that Lauren said that stand out is Mike doesn't take it personal and he kind of scapegoats the the law firm he's like my hands are tired I can't this is just the rule like I'm I'm not the one deciding that this is what we're gonna get paid this is policy but for whatever reason the way that he says it diffuses the situation and then he can get the full attorney fees more often than other people without people being odd and so that's a skill right but is there a teachable not not necessarily scripts but maybe a logic so is there a verbal cue of some but he says this, respond this way, and the result is this. This kind of analysis, which you'd have to listen to so many calls to be able to do that, but if we could get to the point where I think we can, probably in the next year or two, AI could do that really well, and you could identify, you read the book switch, right? Do you remember the phrasing, bright spots? Okay, so they are the anomalies where everything is bad and then all of sudden you've got something that's just amazing, and a lot of times it was something that already existed, so it was a resource that you already own. I'll give you the example and I'll throw this in for you Dan. So there was this guy, he had to go to some Asian culture, I don't remember where it was, where the children were malnourished, and he had about six weeks in a very minimal budget and had to overhaul it and improve their nutrition. And he was a college, something that was funded through college and so you know he had to succeed with all these limits but what they did is they calmed all the data and they found out that there was one location where the children were actually doing really really well and so they went down there and they observed their daily life and they noticed that the mothers when they were working in the rice fields that they would take the shrimp that they found in the water and added into the kid's rice and so they were getting protein and so the kids were healthier and that actually was available to everybody else in the culture but it wasn't a practice across that that area I don't even remember where it was I wish I did I read it like 10 years ago anyway so that resource was available to everybody but only one person was using it so they didn't need a new budget they just needed to tell people use what's in front of you put it in the rice give it to your kids they'll be better you may boom right so it already existed so my point is that if we can get better data, even more deeper data stuff that we've never even thought about really looking into, because it was a pain in the and Mark doesn't like pain in the is data. I just had this conversation with the other person like I don't want to do that. Anyway, um, friends go figure. Anyway, um, then we can figure out where are the bright spots in sweet loss. Like, is there something that Samantha does on calls that makes her even better? Um, I think that there's going to be more that we can figure out. And if we can figure out how to safely, ethically reliable, reliably get AI into, listen to these calls and give us some kind of info. That would be, we could really improve and up level all of your existing people. with feedback from what's already happening inside this route. I wore myself out talking too much. But anyway, hopefully that was useful. Dan, you're quiet. Are you in a rabbit hole?
00:29:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm like sitting here going, I think I could build a demand rider right now with high level. I think because you don't need, you don't. So right now we, for the AI bot that closes people into appointments, we've trained it. So it has this massive prompt that it's always referencing, but the prompt is in a document. So that's the data storage example that I was getting earlier. Here, it's just, I don't know if it's a text file. can't remember. But, and then we let it round. And then we massaged it based on the outcome, we said, oh, don't do that, do this, don't do that. So now I'm like, okay, we just sort of mapped out the parameters. Obviously, it's not exactly right, but it's in the neighborhood. There's not that many. So it's like, okay, you had a form and then you, the form had these elements in it. And then you said, you just have someone fill out that form. Again, it's just all going to be about the prompt. So if I fill out that form and I send it to the prompt, what do I get at the output, right? And that's a very, like, we don't need a production ready, passable, blah, blah. What's the point in doing all that if it doesn't work, right? are around the sizzle. Hey, we're going to go build a business around this sizzle. But... If the stake is no good, I don't care how easily it is. And that's, what are the odds, right? That, I mean, I can tell you right now, I'd be willing to bet a lot that none of these companies have a pre-lit lawyer at the helm saying that's a good demand, right? And let's face facts. What do you need at the end? You need a good demand. What's a good demand? The one that gets you more money than the demand, right? They don't even have a comparative, but they don't know good from bad. It's like, well, I met with the absurdly guys and they were telling me, which we need to talk about them later, they had what might be another Arizona firm backed by P.E. Money that they sold a thousand leads to. But let's say their leads are $250 a piece, which they may or may not be. can't remember their present. So they dropped 250. Yeah, they drop this, this firm, whoever they are, drop $250,000. And then they were like to add sardly. How do we know this is working? Come again. You guys don't know what to do. So then the ads are like, well, you know, you're going to want to look at how many you convert to a retainer, like, what is that blah blah blah. is over the course of like two or three months, and then they pulled the plug and they said, okay, we're going to stop and we're going to evaluate and see what the outcome is. Pardon, your outcome is not coming for about six more months.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (3)
FYI.
00:32:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you're lucky, if you have lawyers. So clearly, nobody in that project was an actual personal injury lawyer, ever worked in a law firm, any idea how these things go. So they just see, oh, sizzle, can have non lawyer. partners. Let's go. Woohoo. Then they would say I stuff, right? So all you really need to do is just, it's all about the prompt. The prompt will be is the ultimate piece of IP. It's not chat TPT.
00:33:15 - mark sweet (3)
Anyone can access that.
00:33:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the piece in the middle. And having a good demand as an example choose to say these guys even know what a good demand is. And then your point, that demand might need to be financed by state, right? You can't just have a demand demand demand demand demand, right? They're not all the same yet. That's how they position it. And then they just slap this huge price tag on it.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
None of the sites have pricing on it, which is always a digital way. If you build anything, that's AI related, Dan, and it is prompt related. What I want you to do is build a dummy test scenario that you run through regularly because my experience is that the output is changing. For example, I have a game that I like to play, and I like to get some photographs, and I have a group, whatever. It's my little, it's my little unwind thing. But I noticed that the output of the group was kind of low, so you help people, so you don't have to buy boosters and upgrades to get through things, and I like to do that, whatever. So I started giving stats, and we went from 200 helps a week to 2,000 to 200 helps a week in a matter of like a few weeks, because they gave people stats. But anyway, I use AI to screenshot all of the players and their rankings and their helps, and it did it really well in the beginning, and now I'm having an issue with the same exact prompt and the same exact data, getting it to give me the same kind of report. So what that alerted me to is that I need to have a test prompt and a test result, right? So if I ask you to do this, I expect a specific type of output. If I give you the same exact prompt every single time, I should get something within 99% of the same kind of output. Because if you're building, let's say, a demand writer, and you give it the parameters, and all of a sudden the algorithm in the background changes. And now, or, and this is what I actually think happened, more, what's the word, the law changes, and they just can find what it can do? If the parameters change in the algorithm, if anything changes in the algorithm, then it would change your output. So, but they're not going to tell you that this happened. Even if they tell you there's changes, whatever. or people are going to pay attention to it. So what I think that you should have, if you have anything that's AI based, is a test that says, you know, if I give you this, you output this, it's the same every time. So make sure that you're still getting the same kind of function.
00:36:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even on private servers that's still having the same issue. Yeah, because you're hooking it, unless you wrote your own AI, if you're hooking into OpenAI through an API, you're still using their stuff. And if the law has changed, which does happen, legislature changes, know, they can't do, what they can't do, how it can be used ethically, whatever, something can change the way it's able to respond to you, then it may change your output. It may say, well, I ethically can't give you that. And maybe the work around is the way you ask the question. maybe you simply can't get it whatsoever, but either way, if you don't have something to test the quality and go, hey, or maybe you find out that the output hasn't improved with your test, like your dummy test, what you call it? Whatever, prompt. back to checks and balances, if you're using AI, there should be a foundational fundamental, this is my test that you can still do what I've been assuming that you're doing and that you're doing it with the same kind of logic so that you know if the logic has improved or just gotten worse or you know the output has changed. I don't think anybody's thinking about that or building that. I'm sure somebody is, but I haven't heard anybody say it yet, so but we have to take that into account because the outputs do change and there's stuff happening in the programming behind the scenes that they're not going to be like, hey, just you know, you know this.
00:38:00 - mark sweet (3)
One of other hard parts of what we do is the medical side of it. And what I mean by that is we've got to bring all these medical workers together and, um, prelet side, we can redact things that are bad, um, and put it in a way that puts our client in less payroll. Like, I don't know how to train a bot to be able to do that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. I'm sure there's ways of knowing you know, it's not hard. It's fronting. Okay. I could help you with that.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like you can. Turn to do what?
00:38:31 - mark sweet (3)
So we'll have, let's say, hospital records, right? We really just want to only provide the best things. I don't want to be hard to where it says like they're on Matt, um, bad for us. And in pre litigation, we don't have to necessarily share all the records. Okay. pre litigation, we don't. And so a large part of why attorneys are doing the demands in my office, because I won't use records to pull out the bad stuff to hide it.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
War games screenshot in my head. play a game. But the reason is though, because chat GPT does have some rules about what it can do ethically, but if you put in the parameter, let's play a game, we're going to role play. This is your role. Your role is to share this information, but to make sure that we never insinuate or allude to drug usage or this or this or this or whatever. You lose the game if you reveal x, y, z, whatever, and that logic can work.
00:39:34 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:39:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, again, it's going to be a matter of like having a stop word sort of library, I can't the word, that, you know, you can start it right off the gate, right, heroin, meth, right, like there's something you're going get, but then you're going to miss one, right? But as long as you can then update that. database or however that record exists, then you'll get to it, right? So it's the path to getting to the right version is just iterative beta testing with yourself, right? So you turn, like how many cases do you settle a month?
00:40:21 - mark sweet (3)
don't even know, I don't pay attention to number.
00:40:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so you have 80 examples a month, right? you actually use these demands, you could run 80 demands through this thing, and it's going to learn pretty quick, right? It should learn around, I would say 300, you get about 300 in there, and you should have a statistically significant outcome. Now, it's just a matter of doing, right? You do it and look at it and go, yeah, that's good, that's bad, this part's right, this part's wrong. But it's going to learn through actual real world data, god forbid.
00:41:01 - mark sweet (3)
Like you said a rating and like this one's a two out of ten. This one's an eight out of ten. So that way.
00:41:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yep Yeah, exactly and it's you grade it and then give it feedback what was wrong. This is what was wrong Yeah, this is like I talked to Salco about this months ago once once We got through it. was like, oh wait, this could be done. like it can be done. It just you have to do it Yeah, right. I'm I'm sure if you set up one of these services and then run a demand through what comes out You're gonna be like, this is not great And they'll go oh, we're working on it.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're working on it.
00:41:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How are you working on it?
00:41:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, that's literally my concern is this just gonna be what they have which is the same as just a template pulled together, right? my own thing then someone else's right because you need to us Then with their every situation where we can make it like a one butt click from ourselves for us or no
00:42:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
probably, but that's like the next level, right? Then you have to go right, sales course app version, but the parts that you would you carry over would be the prompt, right? Then you just have to say, Oh, this, this front end. Let's say the front end is just always a form. Oh, this front end form needs to be a whatever their language is called. I forgot what it's going, but it needs to be a blah, blah, form, but then it's still going to go hit any API for charge, even tea, and then it's going to output it inside of the sales force app. And then probably turn into a PDF or whatever.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just a reminder, an encouragement, although I think you get excited enough about the stuff that you don't need it, but the habit that we have of iterations and also just so So you start building something knowing it's not the end product. It's. going to change, you're going to have to do some rework, but it's not really rework because it's iterative, because it's going to have been improved, because you will have learned something that it's then a compounding effect of what you started with and a little bit of a tweak, but in terms of like building something and then hooking it into Salesforce, when you try to have a conversation with somebody ambiguously, like there's no nothing really specific and they're just trying to imagine what that looks like, you're dealing with the limitations of their brain, whereas if you have something that already exists, now you're talking to a coder who deals with API, plus who's familiar with Salesforce and what the options are and whatever, then it becomes much easier conversation because you have a foundation to start with. So if you're willing to put the elbow prison and spend some time trying to figure out a base level framework and get it. started what happens is the same thing that happens every time we've created any type of framework around data or systems or whatever is that you look at it and you're like oh I didn't think about this I didn't think about this and it is a revelatory revelatory process that makes everything else easier but usually what happens is people just think it think it think it think it think I'd like to think the solution you can't you create the solution then the real solution presents itself so you're in the position now of just I mean whether it be something that you use to massively leverage sweet law and I say massively but let's think about it on an energy level and also just kind of alleviating what's tedious or minutia for you and for your people when you have the ability to conserve conserve that energy then all that energy gets to put into higher leverage activity so in and of itself Oh, that is a great play, but then if you create a system that is now kind of proprietary system that you can go sell and monetize, but also not just, you know, coldly because you can go make money, but you also go to get to help your friends use a system. And then you find all of the, you know, related type of activities that it can be used for different types of markets, the dog food like there's. Just using AI to analyze and figure out things. I mean, there's, there's so many plays to it if you're willing to sit there and think and work out the solutions like as much time as Dan is spent in high level. And as much time as you spent just researching and marketing and having all these conversations with different people you put all of that together and. Pretty awesome.
00:45:50 - mark sweet (3)
think. Yeah, no, Dan's super anonymous me almost thought this is all, but if we can actually build the stake behind this is all then we've got something.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And even if you only use it for yourself, I have many tools that I've built just for me. I enjoy them daily.
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
But as you like to say, Dan, what are the hardest people to sell?
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, would be, you know, the best products are the ones that solve your own problem, right? And it's not just you know, it's not just your problem, right? And then then you also have tied to that, the whole story brand aspect of, oh, yeah, no, you know, it's trite to say, build for Laurie's bio borders. But in this scenario, it's not, it's not trite. mean, it's, I don't know if that gets used a lot actually in this space, to be honest, but you know, we get built from, built from marketers by marketers, but it's, it's true. And it's like, you know, you could, then you can go into this whole story brand aspect of it. And also results before and after, before. before demand rider, after demand rider, right? Whether it's saving time, it's an increase, like Salco's convinced that you can increase your bottom line through ruptured, like really dialing in the demands.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can increase my bottom line.
00:47:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that's true, if that's true, let's say that does happen, you're also going to free up time for lawyers, which may or may not have a result, but it's quantifiable, right? These are the these are the cornifiable outcomes of this thing.
00:47:40 - mark sweet (3)
So, we just kind of need to pick A-Link to start with, I guess, for lack of a better term, because there's just so many options for where to go, but demands make the most sense.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Organizers get them processed, analyze, start there. So, first, it would be getting files that could be fed,
00:48:00 - mark sweet (3)
to AI first securely there is one other thing that I think actually AI can do very very well and it's already somewhat in our system which is pulling by insurance companies and by adjusting their settlements and what total damages are produced damages are to see who we do better with and who we don't do as well with and see if there's anything between doctors we use and don't use yeah I don't have enough data for everything everything but at least we could tell by insurance company and get it started and it's just feeding more data as things go yeah like State Farm I think that now they are very bad State Farm to State Farm things and they're on there we're going to let you get lot of stuff because we're spending too much money which they go every like three to five years between this yeah that was the interest that uh that thing that Josh showed us is doctor thing and then how I when I when he pulled that up I was like wait a second
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like he, he's like, oh, you can use this to find doctors, which I thought was interesting, but then he was also saying that it did that. It should, it allowed you to then look at your outcome per doctor. So you could be like, you know what, this doctor doesn't get as good as this doctor. But then you could go back to that tool and be like, I need a new pain management dude in this area. And then all of a sudden, here's the 20 guys in that area.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if anybody remembers somebody was asking about tracking doctors and creating his spreadsheet for that, just so we can get that data. Bring any bells at all. Oh, yeah.
00:49:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So his thing, his thing does it. I also thought it was interesting. Did you catch this mark? was like, hey, wait, what? So he basically was like saying that your firm's bigger than theirs, right?
00:49:55 - mark sweet (3)
That was the bye I was getting yet.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Didn't he also say that they refer out three?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
hundred cases a month.
00:50:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was like, wait, what?
00:50:03 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. Now, how many hours, how many are actually like retained or referred out? think are different numbers.
00:50:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, yeah, me too. This was the conversation I had with the ads, certainly guys. Yeah. So oh, yeah, back to that. They gave me all the data on this. We'll just say it was the new Arizona firm. They converted 14% of those leagues. But that's with their version of I'm sure those guys were just retainers, right? They're gold. metric is retainers. It's like, no, the metric is cases. They are different.
00:50:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, I could believe if your criteria is crap, then mine, right? have a great tier. I can believe 14% fairly is because we're at what percent would have certainly like five?
00:50:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's everyone's five.
00:50:57 - mark sweet (3)
Right? Right?
00:50:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like that number comes up all
00:51:00 - mark sweet (3)
time. I don't know how to refer it out as how many 10 10 percent.
00:51:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:51:07 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah.
00:51:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So we need to get so we need to get that in place which we talked about before like there's referred out and then we need we need to differentiate with out for referral and then as been referred out because right now it seems like things are referred out but if you pointed out on those three or four that I sent you you're like I don't think anyone's going to take those however the system says refer it out so I'm like we need to change that.
00:51:34 - mark sweet (3)
Oh yeah absolutely no it's still referred out because again we're going find anything from even from the jobs 50 percent if one out of you know 10 they get some money on but still one more that I wouldn't have any money in.
00:51:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well yeah the quick math we did a couple of weeks ago was it's five grand so it's like okay five grand you know nothing especially if it's just a phone call but if you were to go in right now and say refer it out times 5,000, that would be a false number. It's not really that. So, I actually talked to Isaac about that. He's going through the Salesforce course. He's learning some things.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, speaking of Josh, what does he have for us in reports right now? You were saying that he could do the...
00:52:20 - mark sweet (3)
We had a really cool meeting that you're going to like, but he needs a little time to put it together.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I heard about it. I'm really upset I didn't get to be there.
00:52:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Listen, it was I don't meet with him ever. So super, he was like, can we do it Thursday? I was like, uh, okay. But normally it's all email. It's not face to face. Or zoom or anything. And it's actually normally it's email through Stacy.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even email him. No recording.
00:52:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't get to hear all the smart stuff. You don't.
00:52:56 - mark sweet (3)
I'm sorry. I like the end result of it.
00:52:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's a good part.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like the conversations because then my brain goes, whoa, this is good.
00:53:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, fine. He knows this for sure.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here's the thing. He's the guy who has access to all the data I have been asking for for years.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Some of it.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:53:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For sure.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Either way, it's just I decided to see.
00:53:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you have to his thing builds it. So that data doesn't really exist with his add on. It can. So it's like he, he has two apps that he, I guess, sells. don't know. He didn't actually get it. He did not try to sell us on them at all, which was also funny. He just showed to show them to us and he's like, nerding out on them. I like, yeah, but it's kind of interesting. I suppose we could ask him how much the app is.
00:53:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might be it. Could you do that and ask him to like. I'm gonna tape a demo and let's just hope that he just gets really geeky in there.
00:54:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:06 - mark sweet (3)
thinking about this though.
00:54:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. Oh, yeah.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, will you ask for that?
00:54:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm already doing it.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay. This is gonna be fun. See that and somebody who is excited to go create it and get it for us. I mean, you guys, that's a golden kiss right there. Golden Goose. Okay. Um, uh, down you said you needed to talk about the answer to the guys, but was that what you just talked about? Also, yay for record month.
00:54:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's good. I was not outrageous. So what was not outrageous? Or spend like we didn't over spend to try to get to that number.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you spend?
00:54:58 - mark sweet (3)
I don't have the final number. Because they're still adding stuff into the system. So like the very, very rough number. Was. About 420 case spent.
00:55:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:55:23 - mark sweet (3)
The other week or so we should have the final final numbers, but it looks like it should be around that. Numbers are going to go down and it'll just go up. So it might be, you know, instead of 4,100, 4,250, which is still a lot better than where we were.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, would you divide that by incident or people incident. Okay. Okay.
00:55:49 - mark sweet (3)
If I'm trying to sell or from trying to like position myself, I do it obviously by people because it looks better and how 99% of firms look at things. I just don't look at that way from the market. Because again, it's one call, it's not three different calls, right?
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:08 - mark sweet (3)
Um, and they also include their drops and subouts and then try to pull those out as well. Because if we kept those numbers, if we look by person and by drops of outs, then we're at 126, that brings the number down to, you know, 33, which is a significant difference from 4,100.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I mean, that's really good. Yes. And your subout rate, what we haven't done, which I want to do when we're starting to track it, is just kind of figure out what that percentage is, 8% roughly, right now. But I'm tracking it over time.
00:57:01 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, in this case, it was just, there was one set out where someone signed with three firms in total. Um, I mean, the drops, I put the reasons why all of them in total sense. Um, you know, one, maybe we could have done a better job of the upfront just to try to keep them with their response. If everything else was, you know, a pretty good reason, um, you know, stopping right after a setup. So we need to figure out, is there something better once they sign an agreement to get them to feel better with us? And both those were HQ intakes. So I need to see what we can do to shore that up. I don't know if the HQ intakes do it in Vegas. The guy who runs it's about four, uh, five foot two.
00:57:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not so bad. Hey, that's a good height.
00:57:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For a guy. Mm hmm.
00:57:51 - mark sweet (3)
who? ball guy with mustache.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Portuguese girl.
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. Okay. Um, because you're coping. Myers is trying to buy all their leads. California, because they have a lead generation business goes with it. They're doing that nationwide, but they're having issues and having to like fire some clients. They like to work with us because we're relatively easy to work with and we get in the answer to the phone. We actually follow up. So. I'm trying to steer away from them saying everything Jacoby is obviously one more. Their cost is 3,500 per retainer. including their cost.
00:58:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's not. It's not late.
00:58:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:58:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So their lead to they close it themselves. Correct. Oh. Have you seen what? Well, you've gotten it, but it's not. You've already seen what they signed. Right. So what percentage.
00:58:45 - mark sweet (3)
And I see you respond to them.
00:58:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:48 - mark sweet (3)
It doesn't seem very. I say 10% we say, what did you sign this?
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly. So I was going to say probably still about 10% right. So they're not. Cucouville as far as signing the wrong stuff.
00:59:05 - mark sweet (3)
Now, can I get the price point? may make sense, but I don't know.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's going to. Yeah, let's say, yeah, if it puts it up at 4,500, remember, um, could score work.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
Look, in special outcomes.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Analyzing as a vendor.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so just will just will have the per vendor. That's what I was going to ask.
00:59:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, we're doing per vendor per state, and then we're checking the ROA all the way through to see what our ROI is on each source.
00:59:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:43 - mark sweet (3)
But then hopefully we also add on per attorney. So we'll see which attorneys doing what.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, understand you guys all like want growth and they don't get excited about anything and really celebrate the win. That's a big celebration.
00:59:58 - mark sweet (3)
And then you should celebrate with your whole team and tell them. They're reading large bonuses this month so i'm already um super thrilled about spending more money.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's not the only way to celebrate you can just oh i need to schedule another like follow-up meeting with you too. I want to do that.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah almost sixty two thousand dollars this past month on bonuses which is a lot.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot um yeah but you don't have to just use money to thank people.
01:00:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah people like money.
01:00:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They do like money but they also like praise.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do in LA. They also like praise and knowing especially yours.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah they also like money.
01:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh whatever. Okay um so we spend a lot of time talking about the AI stuff just one other Just want to start getting up over one because it's going to take a lot of time to get it right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not this is not okay. By next week we got a process. That'd be cool but. that's not yeah likely um but in every case that we get the policy limit on meaning we get the most amount um circling those to feed because we always want to give chat sheet see the best data although guess we can say hey oh void writing demands like this as well yes you so you want to a high low yeah yeah for sure and it's worth all the effort to organize that data to feed it correctly and then give it the parameters and really have um measure the output based off of the prompt there's there's a lot of leg work to do but then once you do it it goes really fast so um i mean i think that's really it uh is there anything else that we should discuss rather um then try to start any new conversations right now that was a good conversation and especially because
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're leverage and optimization, which is really the overarching, you know, target that we have the most out of the least.
01:02:08 - mark sweet (3)
So we can go with Dan, you know, there's more money to be made for Dan and for me, for the separate side projects that are not just the law for themselves. And I want to make Dan and myself lots of extra money.
01:02:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, you know, there you go.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just watch.
01:02:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, look, this is the doctor run, right?
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doctor notes like I'm down for it. I got lots of time to work.
01:02:32 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, I want to hire a teen and make her my money too. She's not.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. So is there anything that's pressing anything that we should know or just to bring that for an agenda for next week? On either side.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (3)
And this month, I'll be waved into Colorado and to We don't have anybody in Colorado to do it. We have both Fuji and agape.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I'm an attorney.
01:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Like you're the only one that we able to do Colorado. Yeah, the same way we do like Washington right now.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying cuz like somebody's already in New Mexico, but not you.
01:03:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm asking Colorado is open for the Colorado's mark and mark AI.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3)
Here we go. Yeah, no Colorado is we're trying to. haven't done anything with it yet. Um, although thing of it, the dude who was selling like coaching, he did like a really crappy job with Andy Stickel on the other dude. I don't remember who that is. Anyway, they connected with the guy in Colorado who just does a bunch of billboards, but doesn't want to actually work, and wants to spend all his time in Italy. So, yeah, maybe they'll be in part of connection there, but I don't know.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, anything else?
01:04:00 - mark sweet (3)
Talk to Tom and the CAMG people about potentially doing boards into Mexico because that may not be the worst place to start and start getting like our message a little bit clearer and our feet under us to some level. That's just one thing we really haven't done much of any on is, you know, traditional.
01:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love to see the valiant breakdown by state.
01:04:31 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it was actually kind of interesting. No Washington, despite generating a decent number of Washington leads in no California.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how much of New Mexico was him.
01:04:49 - mark sweet (3)
I'll tell you right now because he had asked him the same thing and to do the breakdown form. So that was for Missouri, five New Mexico for Washington. Sorry, no Arizona, that was not Washington, Arizona, that was weird.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Missouri, what?
01:05:10 - mark sweet (3)
Or Missouri, five New Mexico, Washington. But he generated a decent number of Arizona leads, just not an abandoned anything.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do the rest of the New Mexico ones come from?
01:05:26 - mark sweet (3)
Three came from Quantify. One came from Felipe, one came from Monkey, five from Valiant, three from Walker.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just asking because for the longest time in Mexico was averaging like two, and then we jumped up all of a sudden, just a few months ago to six, and now we've got thirteen. I mean, those retainers, that that trajectory is impressive.
01:05:56 - mark sweet (3)
It's quantifying Valiant, those are the two that really made the difference.
01:06:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
before quantifies Ben and quite frankly pretty good find thanks for mustache guy yeah like I said he never know so we're like him sort mustache guy yeah that's a case HQ but who found them case HQ on case HQ no case HQ came from case connect guys yeah and then case HQ referred quantified and who did case connection guys come from me that was the pedigree before it was me yes okay okay it was me for being on Facebook sort of case Nick was an absolute monetary failure for us that's okay they saw
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you have to look at the pedigree, you have to look at the little chart there, it matters, cause and effects, everything.
01:07:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, that is good point, right? It's like, some, right, it's not a fail, it wasn't a, it was a lesson, right? wasn't a failure in one respect, but then it's like led to this and led to this.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It had a return, even if the return was indirect.
01:07:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then other people won't do it, right? That's like, that's what the ads are dealing with right now. All these firms they call, they're like, please stop calling me.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, I'll bet. Also, this goes into the practice, which we intentionally and purposely have, which is exploring all the vendors. right. Yeah, exactly. that they're going to be crap and knowing that even if they are crap, sometimes there's a tangent that is valuable to us and, but look at, I mean, record number, When we started your low 30s, mid 30s, and now you're here, and one of the practices is exploring all the vendors, having all the conversations, and it is tedious, and it is risky, and some of them don't pan out. But because of the relationships in those conversations, and the secondary and tertiary conversations that happen as a result of the first one, look at where you're at now, all these different sources, just the change in power and who's bringing what across the state, it's just, I just want to pay attention to the practices and the value of that, because it's important.
01:08:43 - mark sweet (3)
So monkeys back to where it shouldn't be, because they did concerned over last month, obviously, because the numbers didn't make sense.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I feel like you leave You you manage the vendors better. I feel like you were a little bit more reactive before you didn't know your numbers, you weren't on top of them and you were hesitant to want to have conversations with them. I think you felt like they had a little bit more power over you than the other way around the dynamic has shifted and all of that has happened mostly. Here's the thing. The other thing about data that people don't really notice is that it creates a level of confidence in you know what you know. And so you do what you do even better, and that adds to more confidence and it's a compounding effect too but when you negotiate with people confidently their outcome is very different. So, anyway, all of that just takes into account. So, just wanted to point it out.
01:09:52 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I just got to repeat it and beat it. think we're tenors out for next month already so that's good.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good September. I can.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
That's all right. Yeah. Well, I dropped for it. That's fine. So we'll repeat it again, which is good. And then starting soon, have Yuri. He's a lot of Thark joining us. So he's a Ukrainian Lot Thark dude and he's going to be taking the bar in February.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And where's he going to fit?
01:10:23 - mark sweet (3)
So when he starts, we just have him do demands because I think it's going to start getting too busy. can do more as a demands. A lot of us quit with his to help Lorenz. He has a very large support system, but we're trying to see if can create another Patrick for lack of a better term where hey, this is kind of good. And you know, short term rental, I guess is the best way to think about it. You get a chance to see the lawyer be it be like in baseball, right? like, oh, it's a mid season pick up, but then like they're down the end of the season. We like to do not like anything. And so if he's a great film another Patrick, he's not great. We'll just say, hey, know, our perfect time done.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. I love that.
01:11:02 - mark sweet (3)
I love that as a problem process to build them up. this is a long term commitment, but but it's not with no without anything because he's doing some work.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's the and also that's easier than going out and just trying to hire anybody because that doesn't go well.
01:11:23 - mark sweet (3)
We're having much more difficult time with it. So it makes more sense to build these people internally or I'll do both quite frankly, where we can find them. We just have to keep an eye on our payroll because that's a lot.
01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is the guy who just like keeps throwing out bonus and left and right.
01:11:40 - mark sweet (3)
That's Mary more than me, but yeah.
01:11:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay. Well, Mary.
01:11:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to start having some other conversations.
01:11:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mary's nickname is money fairy.
01:11:51 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe you didn't know this. Look, we started. That's what I was going to say. You know, if the teams have their goals. to help them do more than push them and do more. So, you know, hey, and those are high numbers. think maybe.
01:12:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But here's the question. Here's the real question. Are these numbers a result of that or not? Because you're for sure related. But right.
01:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what degree?
01:12:26 - mark sweet (3)
Right. I think what's going to be more on the money in than on the settlements themselves because the teams while they do have some controller getting, you know, records and whatnot. I'm sure they feel more like the attorneys are responsible for that. On the money in, you know, maybe something like the teams like the case manager is sitting around like, how close are we, how close are we to see what else they can push to try to get that extra money in.
01:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. It's the amount that will make the biggest impact to you that actually almost makes the least impact to them. So psychologically. If there is a bonus for a thing, it's not necessarily that that bonus has to be a certain number. It just has to be there There's a potential that you're overpaying. So like on the line item for how you can earn the money Taking that back not necessarily you can't take anything back. Anyway, this is a whole big long conversation But my point is is that a lot of times a five dollar Not talking about your attorney your your your attorneys your team But it's somebody just getting an unexpected or an earned extra a small amount Versus a large amount that the happiness level is almost equal. They're obviously our gaps, right? But my point is that To get the lift that you need you probably don't have to give the lifts that you're giving so There is some math to be figured out there, but again you have an existing team Zisting expectations pulling back and then you have have to look at what's available in the market. There's a lot of numbers to crunch.
01:14:04 - mark sweet (3)
And that's probably what it comes to the market, where we can do these interviews, what people want, is more than what we're paying our current people for lower quality.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:14:14 - mark sweet (3)
So this is the way to bridge that gap to some level.
01:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's entirely possible that it's a very, very good system. And so then the other way to leverage your money is to be able to use things like the AI to have them doing less of the tedious stuff. So they're doing more of the money-making activities. So with the same amount of staff, you're getting more money. You're also paying more bonuses. But that still should be maybe it's not a higher percentage of profit margins, but an overall higher bottom line. Then you're still winning the game.
01:14:51 - mark sweet (3)
So I think that's issue for me. is that I wanted an achievable because I hated, hated, hated working for people where the goal is just not realistic.
01:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You feel like you're being set up to fail?
01:15:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. But I think it may actually be a little low because I shouldn't be breaking even every month if they hit their goal.
01:15:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like that's not right.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Exactly. So what kind of How can we visually see this data of what comes in and I have to think about, you know, what I would want to see, but all the different types of bonuses, what all the goals are, who hits them, how they hit them, what it costs you, aside from the bonuses is, you know, the working net revenue up until payroll and bonuses so that we can see that correlation and and look at the performance over time.
01:16:03 - mark sweet (3)
I can't, I'm kind of fried right now, but the most person they got and go through, but you know, again, these are good problems to have right in their goals and in their expectations.
01:16:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's definitely not a bad thing. Oh, I got something. I talked to your boy, Salco. I forget when, but I forget when, but because I didn't answer the phone for a couple days, because I was doing a bunch of with my parents, but uh, so he was saying, and I thought this was interesting because I was like, okay, yeah, I never thought about that. He was saying how he just settled a dog bite through you or whatever, in your, in your firm, I think, for like 75 grand. He's like, yeah, just settled a dog bite for 75 grand. And I was like, okay. And he's like, can any of these vendors generate dog bite leads? And I was like, I don't know, like I never, I've never done it. I've never asked them. I've also never seen it. So I, when I I was talking to Ed, certainly, on my bi-weekly call that I have with them, for whatever reason. I brought it up with them, and the guy was like, really? I go, And he goes, I've never seen anybody do that. go, neither have I. So then he starts researching. He goes, dude, there's nine million dog mike. And he just starts rattling off all the data. And I go, And he's like, why doesn't anybody do this? go, I don't know. I go because lawyers, copy lawyers, copy lawyers. And I go, do you think you could generate them? He goes, yeah. And so when I was talking to South, I go, what's the criteria? And he goes, I mean, you know, that route lost some . And what I heard was, did you get bit a dog? Do you know who the homeowner is? Did you get medical assistance? Medical treatment. That's it. That's it. That's a lead. So I was like, yeah, that would be a lead. Oh, okay. That's a simple form, right? They just fill that out. So then it just becomes a math problem. What's the cost per lead? So if you say, cost per unit is x, convergent is five, right? We always know it's five from internet, basically. Then, and then average case value, you might not have enough data for that. But I go, okay, that's interesting. Like you could do that, but now you're talking about diversifying your case load, right? So everyone's going out to car accidents. You add this into the mix. got it. Now, hold on. You got car accidents and dog bites. Then you're also adding into the mix. Well, now they've had a lawyer with suite law. And when they get, when they get in a car accident, they're going to call a suite. Yep, and the referrals. So now all of sudden you're adding new nodes to your network. I was like, okay, that's interesting. And then it's a different demand, right? So it's like, okay, do you have a good dog bite demand? Sounds like Salko maybe had a good one. have no idea. But I was like, okay, that's interesting. And these guys were like, I can't find one. ad for this. That's it. I can't explain it to you, but I've never done it. Doesn't mean you should.
01:19:07 - mark sweet (3)
One really big difference between a couple between dog biting car accident.
01:19:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:19:13 - mark sweet (3)
The drop rate is massively higher on dog bite because a lot of people don't have insurance.
01:19:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Exactly. So the qualifier, so the 5% might be too in actuality, right?
01:19:29 - mark sweet (3)
So if you if you bake it in a 50% drop rate, you get into the case because that's what I'm saying. So your drop rate is 40% plus.
01:19:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So if you model it at 50, can you even model it out, right? So if you say, okay, going to get, you're going to get, it's $250 a lead, you're going to convert five, and then, and then half of those are going to drop. They probably going to be cheaper, right? Yeah. So I was like, all right. And so the ads certainly guys are looking at it. They're like, wait. this is a thing. I go, it is a thing. I just don't know if it's a thing that works. And they're like, all right, this is interesting.
01:20:10 - mark sweet (3)
And of course, for them, talk about you get decent money on, especially when you talk about minor children getting bit, like we've gotten.
01:20:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the other thing, it's mostly children that get bit just to do sports a lot. No, according to the stats, I don't know if it's truly true.
01:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have a little girl that lives up the street. She got mauled so bad. She doesn't have hair anymore because they she got attacked by two governments and they they chewed up her scout like she shouldn't be alive. She had multiple surgeries.
01:20:43 - mark sweet (3)
It was right. And so if there's insurance on the homeowner, that's, you know, $500 million case.
01:20:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:20:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They got nothing. So those get so you're not totally against this idea, then?
01:20:57 - mark sweet (3)
I'm not totally against the idea because be significantly cheaper for a commitment.
01:21:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would imagine.
01:21:04 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, exactly. But I'm not against the idea because the criteria is, did you get that yes, and then get scarring photos, basically, would like show me the bite because you've got people that it's like, you know, a scratch, like it's what I got. Oh, there you go.
01:21:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:21:18 - mark sweet (3)
But dog bites, especially California, it's there's no one bike for you. think Arizona law is a little different.
01:21:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you just say one bite free?
01:21:27 - mark sweet (3)
So Arizona kind of has that role, actually.
01:21:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're kidding. You had to have to be a second offense, like second strike.
01:21:35 - mark sweet (3)
Unless, you know, a dog with dangerous propensity. Yeah. wow.
01:21:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they were like, we could do California. OK, that would actually be the perfect and biggest population, all that good stuff, man.
01:21:49 - mark sweet (3)
Because you got some plastic assertions and stuff like that.
01:21:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So California would definitely be.
01:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. yeah.
01:21:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Well, I think the other thing is the system, whatever system. some you create like a could do you have access to or would a private investigator or if you hire them have access to like if you get they say yes I know the homeowner this is where they live this is their information where they could go say we know that they have insurance is it a record that a specific entity would have access to no you can hire a investigation companies it just but they're not the best in that regard I mean you send letters the worst case you file lawsuit and discover you find out pretty quickly and you just learn they have nothing and it's kind of a whatever but so if you wrote it all up it's basically here's the boxes this is what has to happen this is this is how long this would take this is what this process would look like so that and then do a rough forecasted like if we were able to get leads at this cost the percentage that have insurance, don't have insurance, the estimated value like I just did a quick search and it says 4.5 million people have been a Forbes report for last year, per year, 800,000 only must seek medical attention of those. Do they know, you know, how much is that is just little stitches or go away? There's nothing like there's so much data to go get and then plug in those numbers and then how much does it take? But even if it added, you know, $50,000,,000 to your gross revenue, that revenue, whatever, all those numbers, you could spend a day or two doing the research and find out if it's even viable, but if it's viable and you've got...
01:23:45 - mark sweet (3)
It's It's viable. Generally, also need to try to target more affluent areas.
01:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't want to target like combat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:23:54 - mark sweet (3)
That's the big difference for the lead generation.
01:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They usually just do state wide and if you live or die by it's an area.
01:24:00 - mark sweet (3)
is where you just, you know, damn well, they don't have anything.
01:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:24:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you're not targeting Compton. I got you're in Compton.
01:24:07 - mark sweet (3)
You're going to target more like Vermont.
01:24:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. Um, else that needs to be talked about this week or tabled for brought up for next week to talk about?
01:24:23 - mark sweet (3)
You know, I mean, I buy things definitely in Avenue. Um, because it's easy to train. like, did you get bit by dog? Yes. Okay. You theoretically have a case like it's not.
01:24:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's also it's another way that you're using your existing resources. So it's getting more out of what you have. And that is leverage. Yeah. That's what we want more of that. Okay.
01:24:46 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. That's a back then.
01:24:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:24:57 - mark sweet (3)
I know. Yeah. That's coming. Yeah. Just as a quick heads up. that's one word for it.
01:25:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, he died when, like today. Yeah. Yeah. That's what him and I were talking about that. He's like, he was like, I don't understand like what he thinks is going on. Like he's kept saying his dad thinks he's going to be doing this and doing that. I was like, dude, nobody, nobody, like, we're all on the same path. We're all on a path to the end. Of course, we're not sitting there going hope it ends.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom is.
01:25:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is true. And they and they accelerate that for them.
01:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
01:25:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not recommended.
01:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not recommended. They're miserable. And they spread them as a read.
01:25:54 - mark sweet (3)
But you had something. All right. We're situation.
01:25:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right guys, till next week.

and then we're talking about do we want to try to find a building when this thing expires or do we want to like keep renting because right now the rental rate that we got for a square foot is actually really good in the other space. Does make sense to take over the entire 6-4 which would double our space and are we going to need that kind of space or we're not going need that kind of space like does it even make sense to go down that route right just logically kind of talking it out and then it became where do we see ourselves in three or five years and yeah that's where it started kind of going off the rails. That would be where the most specificity would be helpful because that's the conversation we have and I've been trying to get as I'm always trying to grow and grow and grow and compare myself to everybody. else and wanting to grow and she's waiting for us to plateau to slow like okay where is the top of it where is it and why are you constantly pushing for higher goals?
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.
00:10:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, and like it's never a straight line either.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Yeah, for sure.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
It is not. Yeah, I thought ended this year would be more consistent in those hundred incidences or not. We've been kind of stuck in that mid 80 range. Yeah.
00:10:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that's the which we know is the reason we try to get as many vendors as we can because other people are pulling your vendors and whether they're doing it with money where they're doing it with negotiations, promises, friendships. don't know, but there's a whole lot of variables that go into how you get those. How good they are at running ads, how much it costs them to run ads. have the ad platforms are doing. Are they, are they improving, you know, their ability to run ads in a costly manner? other deal that you could have, but I mean, that's almost kind of in-house, right? You've got that internal connection, but it's you having conversations around this topic that has been the gateway really to getting more vendors, getting more leads, and that is not something that you do as consistently as could be done. I don't think it's bad at all. don't think it's neglected, but, and I don't know that it could go faster. I don't know that you could do more. There's something that has to be organic about some of these conversations, but I don't know if it's always top of mind for you or if you make time for it on a weekly basis.
00:12:52 - mark sweet
What do you think? No, it's definitely in spurts, so it'll be three or four hours at one time.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, and that's that's something though those are friends and because of the nature of it and everything we know about it that I don't need to tell you. I don't know that doing it more often would be better, but I don't know that it wouldn't.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Yeah. No, I don't know.
00:13:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do know that you're the guy.
00:13:22 - mark sweet
That's all I know. No, it's true. And we got to sit through a lot of them. Just even by ones that were falling up with them from there, not all of them are great. Yeah, what does that happen with that magnetic one?
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you say?
00:13:39 - mark sweet
Remember that magneto? I don't think that's going to come together.
00:13:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, that's Mary's husband, right? Yep. That's that's awesome.
00:13:54 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how much money does he make off of you every every month.
00:14:02 - mark sweet
Not very much.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not great. We make more money from him than he makes for my song.
00:14:09 - mark sweet
Yes and no. I mean, well, we paid like two plus years from the build up this network that does get him money.
00:14:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm.
00:14:18 - mark sweet
had coming out of pocket for it. We are paying all the hard costs and everything else. Okay. seats were not in. He is more than free to sell. So like we connect him to issue intake. I don't know what happened to that at the end of the day.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What else does he do to our money?
00:14:34 - mark sweet
Oh, he's a regular job.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much does he make at it?
00:14:38 - mark sweet
I have no idea.
00:14:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea where I'm going with this?
00:14:44 - mark sweet
You?
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what can we do? He clearly has skills because Dan can do three for this month from him. Yeah, I mean, but so far as I know his costs. less than everybody else is other than the whole network set up. And last month it was like eight, like he's been on a roll.
00:15:12 - mark sweet
No, he's, this is the worst month, that's fine.
00:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what would it, you know, is there a potential room to explore or having him try to get leads any other way through any other platform is his knowledge transferable to ads on another platform. What would it take to pay him for that? And considering, so let's consider like, what, what if he was a employee instead and got a, just hear it all the way out because this is his first version of this thought, right? Got a salary. Would that salary not be cheaper? And we we know that he can get us some business and and would he not be motivated if like he doesn't have a great job he could work from home he could do it okay he could do it more at his leisure but also he could get side gigs if he just becomes really good at getting ads or whatever you could have him sign a non-compete or something or maybe particular types of whatever but what is another way that we can architect a deal here with him where we get some of what's clearly a good brain unless he's just really lucky but I would not say so no not at this level yeah exactly so where you could make you sweet law more of a priority and buy some loyalty from somebody who I mean I don't know I don't know what his other job is and how much he gets paid and how great it is but
00:17:00 - mark sweet
I'm gonna guess he's like 150 to maybe 200.
00:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's, let's go look at Lidify and see how many retainers he sent us this year. Okay. Reports. Let's open, okay. don't want my favorites. I want to start to report. So matters, no, it's matters by state by source status. Maybe that one. Let me shift screen so we look at this.
00:17:40 - mark sweet
So June to September, was doing pretty good. It was a lot of like one, one, one for a while. I'm starting in June, it was 10, July 16, August 14, September 12, 10, remember we're at three.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. numbers to me again.
00:18:01 - mark sweet
So June was 10.
00:18:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:07 - mark sweet
July was 16. August was 14. September was 12. October was 10.
00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna add in the three. So what is the average retainer worth to you?
00:18:22 - mark sweet
Five grand.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that math is 325,000 since June. Roughly. That's super dirty math. know. But it's to give you a concept of could we hire him and pay him as a salary instead of by leads and then give him. So it's not free. Right.
00:18:50 - mark sweet
So we look at the voices.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am. And then so that he's motivated to up his game.
00:19:00 - mark sweet
We're spending about 30,000 a month.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a lot. So that was June, July, August, September, October, six months, nine, six. Yeah, and what I, how much did I tell you?
00:19:15 - mark sweet
hundred and thirty five, I think?
00:19:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So three hundred and thirty five minus two hundred and twenty eight. So that's a hundred and seven thousand. And then you obviously have to have profit. but what if we said, hey, like, if you thought that you get us 20 retainers a month steadily through this and other means within roughly the same profit margins, would you be interested in a salary job with, I don't know if they need benefits or anything?
00:19:54 - mark sweet
No, she, he gives it to her.
00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, and, but with an incentive program. of, you know, if the margins are X and the number is X, then you get this. It could be a tiered performance. So the better he does, the better he gets paid without cutting into the margin. So the tiered should also be built in your favor so that, you know, you're getting more money as he's performing well and paying him better. I have no idea. was just a tangent that we went on. But I get the thought process with it.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
not. It's worth a conversation to have.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really what I'm saying.
00:20:41 - mark sweet
Do you think this can do a lot more?
00:20:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so and the other, the reason I would even consider it is he figures something out. He went from one of these two Z's to the number that he has when we struggled to get roughly that amount of number from. big boy agencies. So something's happening there. And there's no way, and I don't know how to say this diplomatically and not be wrong, but Dan can't replicate what he's done.
00:21:19 - mark sweet
I don't have little to do what I would, and I hope he'd be able to do, quite frankly.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because of my situation, I'm just going to leave that at that. But my point is there is a powerful brain. Oh, for sure. But there's a powerful brain at your disposal right now, who is doing something everybody else that you're paying doesn't seem to be doing as consistently. Now we're three, and it's November 21st. So maybe something dropped, but maybe I don't know, maybe something's going on at home. And maybe it has nothing to do with how the market is or whatever. I don't know. It's even more reason to have a conversation because he's been doing great and now just dipped a little bit. I'm a huge fan of capitalizing on human resources in a reciprocal way, right? How can we be a blessing to you and ensure you continue being a blessing here? Also my help Mary's attitude little bit if he's like, I love Mark.
00:22:30 - mark sweet
No, she thinks both of us are stupid.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, no. What are the odds?
00:22:36 - mark sweet
I'm pretty high.
00:22:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That you're both stupid? Really? Are you dumb boys?
00:22:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, pretty much.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dumb boy things.
00:22:48 - mark sweet
I didn't think you were wrong. It's it is what it is. I need to jump in a different way there and keep the money component out of our economy. patients and keep her to think she's really good at which is training people.
00:23:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A compartmentalizing and keeping her in a job role that works for her. It's not a bad thing when people have employee mindsets. Where would we be without those people who are like, you just want to show up and do the job and then want to go home? I don't want to own the business, don't want all that responsibility. Those are the people that show up and run our businesses without taking it away from us and selling it to the highest bidder. We need those people badly, but you really need to know who they are and you need to, like you say, show up for them and ask of them only what really they can handle well. What we want to do is the same reason people get and stay in bad relationships is because it's comfortable and it's there. It's what in front of you, and it's a lot of work breaking somebody else in, but that is not the way to excellence, that's not the way to growth, that's not the way to even being happy in the end, no matter what it is, even if it's a professional relationship. Yeah, so, you know, there's been, you may have grown out of the relationship you had with Mary, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a place, but I mean your perspective of what she was to you, is to you, whatever your right hand, which Dan and I would both disagree with, but we both know we're not there every day. I don't know if Salka would disagree, but Salka would disagree, he's probably just probably disagreeing no matter what.
00:24:52 - mark sweet
Right, with an extremely low turnover.
00:24:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that?
00:24:56 - mark sweet
They're extremely low turnover, it's not because we're- Overpaying people.
00:25:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm not saying she's not amazing and great, but but And what it was Yeah, but I mean you go into any corporation and you've got, you know, executive officers doing their job And that's their job. That's that's just all it is It's an executive officer showing up the way that they're supposed to. They're not necessarily the right hand now the vp. Yes but But VP is going to be over everything a VP of just the company right not vp of sales and vp of Whatever human resources that there's depending on how big you get, you know, this structure changes the names change the title change, but you know very rarely Does somebody actually have a right hand and when you do That relationship that they identified in rocket fuel generally is the actual one where you've got a legitimate, real-life, bona fide visionary and integrator and you are not what I would call a bona fide visionary, like I feel like you have a little bit fall on the spectrum of the integrator which is actually really good, you'll do matter that way, but it means that you don't have as much of a need to have a person that can do all the things and so you didn't have to go find one of those. You were able to compartmentalize and find different types of leaders in your organization and even create them not just me. So anyway, like I said, there's a lot more that you and I could be working on but it takes more time and digging into some of these conversations. If I could understand more of the mechanics of what Mary is doing and what Mary it wants, and obviously probably not with talking to Mary, but you and I, you explaining it well, we could probably find the, the, um, hold on a second, I'm just making sure it's not a child messing and messaging me.
00:27:15 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:27:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the, like the ideal roles and responsibilities really were, um, but then also changing what conversations you have, um, as a result of it and not counseling about certain types of decisions. Now, you would need a replacement who would you counsel with in, in those things and make sure that, you know, who you're going to for that because otherwise, you're going to end up going back to Mary and then, and then you've now kind of encroached on, on what you had tried to create as a compartment. So we need to make sure, All of that is taken care of, but the better place to start is what do you want to build with Sweet Law in the next one, three, five years? And those are separate visions, but I would work backwards from five years. So what would you like it to look like in five years and then let's break it down going backwards?
00:28:39 - mark sweet
It's something I've been thinking about more and more, like where are you trying to get to and do I want to get to and why, by the way, make sure that why is in there.
00:28:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your, what is the thought that you come to most often? And.
00:29:00 - mark sweet
question. in terms of the wire, in terms of the numbers.
00:29:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Period. So anything, like, what is the thought that comes into your head most often when you think about, like, where am I going?
00:29:16 - mark sweet
So this is morbid. I'm just saying that just to kind of brace you for it little bit.
00:29:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I doubt you're going to shock me because you don't know the thing my head does.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
But it's not my normal, like, thought process. Because if you and my thought process is like, I just want to grow because it's fun. It's exciting. It's way more fun than just running a stable ship, which is just running the day-to-day. there's nothing super exciting about it. more just putting up basic fires, right? Mm-hmm. difference is I think I probably have, I mean, I pray it's all wrong, but around 30 years left until I'm done. And so, More than half my life is gone. I need to do everything I can to just. maximize as much as possible in the short period of time. And. With what we do with what the risk we take. It's not. same trying to double from where we are from where I started.
00:30:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So.
00:30:27 - mark sweet
I know. I know what we do. I know how we treat our clients and it's different than everyone else. Additionally, there's this, you know, book man of. Outside funding BC money, other firms coming in. That's always kind of hanging around out there. If we get to the point where we're a certain size, we have a bit of a built in moat where we can absorb a back quarter or whatever it may be. Does that make some sense?
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:31:00 - mark sweet
And it's not necessarily coming from a place of fear. That's not what the goal that is.
00:31:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, hold on. I have to ask this before we go on because you said you need to maximize this, build it as big as it can be or something.
00:31:14 - mark sweet
was that language? Yeah, something like that.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why?
00:31:23 - mark sweet
So, when I die, there's enough to take care of everyone.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who is everyone?
00:31:28 - mark sweet
Everyone.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need you to be specific because clearly you can't be in everyone in the world. You mean everyone in your family? Do you mean everyone in sweet law? And how, what does that look like? We have to get clear on this definition. Huh? Yes, you both. Okay. What does it look like to take care of everyone in sweet law when Mark isn't here anymore?
00:31:54 - mark sweet
I don't have an answer for that yet.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Let's talk some logistics. First of all, second generation wealth is almost always wasted. The people that receive it don't have the discipline and the respect and the knowledge of how to manage the money to keep what is given to them. It's almost never worth what is given to them. What is put in in order to be able to give it to them? That's the truth. Those are the stats. So in terms of providing for Chona and do you have something for her?
00:32:49 - mark sweet
Yeah, potentially.
00:32:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so we go from taking care of everybody too. Yeah, potentially. So this is the purpose though of the question.
00:33:00 - mark sweet
sounds with her because I know what's wrong. Sorry, come on, It's very nice, but yeah. So with my dad passing, you know, left money to my mom and everything else and she just does not want to spend any money on anything. So I know what's going to be left from that will be enough for my sister to be okay. You know, her house we paid for. She doesn't have huge lofty goals. She's just kind of happy with the status quo.
00:33:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, here's what I want you to do. We can either do this. Well done. You're not allowed to and I'm counting on Elon and Elon type brains. Not there really is one to like figure out how to make is like my is failing. I'm pretty sure like my kid is my pancreas like whatever my organs. I'm like, yeah, anyway, I'm in that boat of my body could shut down at any time and I feel it. So I'm not morbid. I'm just realistic, but I'm going to do everything I can to maximize and leverage it. And I'm not going to count on not being here. But every day, I'm like, let me purge this stuff. Let me make sure my files are in order. Let me make sure that everything is organized so that if I die, I'm not a burden to anybody and I leave as much as good as possible. So I'm with you on that. But you really need to define what it would be what and especially for like China because statistically women outlive their husbands anyway. And she's got a family and but I would really like you to write down a list and we can do this together. If you wanted to have a meeting and it's just you and me because this isn't a Dan thing, know. And this is more like what we're doing right now is more what I normally do regularly, anyway. There's just so much that you do. I would really like more time on it. I could do more for you. But sit down and let's make a list of like be specific about the names, specific about the amounts, specific about how you would have it managed like trust funds. What would you do? Like what would be the parameter of the trust funds so that you have a little bit of a specificity in the vision but also some peace and some targets. So then we have numbers that we know. Now, when we have target numbers and we could have target numbers for what happens if let's say something happens and you're gone and so one of the things and this is why I don't think it's morbid I had a client that I worked for and he was very he's Indian and Brainiac and he taught me so many things about numbers but he would always be like what do we do if you get hit by bus tomorrow like how do we know how to do your job and how does the company not suffer because you're not here so what happens if you get hit by bus or marry or anybody else right these are all the scenarios that we we want to take care of and make sure that we're planned for but you know let's say for some reason you're gone in five years let's say you're gone in ten years like what where could we be in five years to say that in in that five years you're in the best place possible and this is what you know you can leave in five years this is what you know you can leave in ten years So and then we kind of reverse engineer. So let's let's go with the 30 year plan, right? And you're, you're what, like 38 or something somewhere on that? Baby. I'm 40. what I'm trying to do. No, no, I know. But but I'm but I'm with you. And you know what your genetics are. There's there's all kinds of things in it. So anyway, so if we figure out, first of all, down who we're talking about taking care of specifically and what do you mean and taking care of them? And I don't mean like a number but a number that has a meaning. Could you live off of this number for how many years? Could you live off of this number and this number has enough money to make you interest for you to keep living off of as income for the rest of your life? Given this type of parameter and this house is
00:38:00 - mark sweet
You know what I mean? Like a full-on plan.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much money? What does it look like? How is it managed? And how does the money keep making money if possible at at at a chona like family level? And then what are the other people? And and what does it look like? So for sweet law could be a severance type package that is that has to be like if it goes for sale or something like that. Like what are the ways that you could provide for your team if something happened to you and you didn't have any like runway exit, right? Like you're just gone. There is no I got to chance. So everything is already put in place. And then what we have is just kind of like a baseline number and targets. Then what we do is go, okay, well here's the target, here's the time we're doing it here's the life I want to live during that time. I'm not going to be grinding away all week every week trying to... and for death. Because you should be planning for life. The best thing you can do for people here is not die for them, but live for them, you know, live with them. And so then what we have to do is look at basically effective hourly rate of your earnings. We have to look at how does your money work for you? How does your money make more money for you? Is it just sweet law? Are there other opportunities where you could be getting that money? And I think they can, especially with the people that you know, with the interests you have, with the willingness that you have to work and the skills that you are constantly acquiring. I think that there's a lot of opportunity for you to get that very leveraged income and wealth, but you really have to choose where you're spending your time. and that includes making the time for all the fun stuff that really make it even worthwhile for you. But it starts with the how you want to take care of people and what that specifically looks like so that we can work backwards from that because if that's what you care about most is how do I leave this world. That's what I think about every day. That goes into why I have so few clients but need to get paid so much because how I want to leave this world is first of all having spent the best not crying Tina quality time with everybody that I interact with no matter how it is. And I'm not. spiritually invested into and so that's number one so because at the end of every day like if I die today I can sit there while my eyes are closing and I'm on my way out going this is what I did that was good today and this is the lives I touched I didn't have a fight with anybody I didn't say bad things I didn't put hate into the world I did what I could to organize and to reduce burdens to increase them you know those types of things so it doesn't matter when I go there's not going to be any regrets that's one of the first things so in my architecting it's no regrets make sure that every day is spent in a way that's no regrets so that affects my time my energy who I'm spending it with and then the next thing is the finances like making sure that I'm not first of all never in a situation where I'm worried about money, which you know what I that experience, like I got to handle it because if I'm worried about it, then I'm thinking about it and being obsessed with money. And that puts me in a terrible mood, which means my experience is my first priority, which is the interactions I have with people every day. That suffers because my brain is somewhere else and it's in trouble and it's in stress and so it can't be in love and it can't be in encouragement, you know what I mean? So think about that would be one thing that you could do also. So what is the long term like when I leave this world, if I leave it, you know, years from now, decades from now, how would I like to leave it? But if I get called today, what can I have done today to make sure I'm not going , I wish I had not done this or done this differently. But then no matter what you do Mark is long as you are on that path every day. I Can't guarantee it because I haven't died yet, but I have been on the threshold several times. I Know what it feels like to know that your life can just slip out of your body I've been not close to death with illness so many times and I Do know what it feels like then just to be peaceful and just look like yeah, I did as much as I could up to now so That will help you with and but what I can tell you too is the correlation to how I run my business You can't really even call it that because technically it's just a glorified job If I don't work it doesn't work. There is no money. So it's a job, but But the way that I plan it is around that and not the other way around So, no, I don't think it's more of it. think it's great. think that solving that problem and being clear about what you want that to look like will help answer all the other questions I've been trying to pull out of you with more ease. And I also think that, I don't know, there's something very liberating about being able to look at it that way because, and you're already getting into this. So, think that you've kind of been doing some of this on your own, whether fully consciously or partially, but you can put things in perspective and realize, okay, this is good. I would like it to be better, but here's, this is good. This is good. is good. you know, basically good enough, but I want to do better. Like, there's this simultaneous kind of like, it's not even vacillating back and. between one, but it's like, it's not a hamster wheel, but it's almost like this circular thing of it's good enough for this moment, but it can be better.
00:45:12 - mark sweet
So let's keep going. You know what I mean? Yeah, like, this is fine. I'm okay with this.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or today. But tomorrow I want more and and not in an obsessive angry. I'm not satisfied with what we've accomplished or like, not I don't appreciate what's been done, but let's not lose momentum. Let's not waste this day. Yeah. That would be a great place to start. So do you want? All right. So next week, we're not having a Monday meeting because I'm flying. Did we reschedule that? I think we said we're not doing it because Dan's not working next week.
00:45:55 - mark sweet
It's Thanksgiving week.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. But we will meet
00:46:00 - mark sweet
Second, I'm not meeting with you guys. I think the way what? Because I have that AI conference on the third.
00:46:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. And trying to I cross that off on the 25th. Wait, no, that's Thanksgiving. OK, that's right. OK, so on the second, we're not meeting. Did we move it? We did not move it.
00:46:24 - mark sweet
I will be back on the fourth at some point. So the fifth Thursday, the fifth is totally fine.
00:46:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it'll be a long day. Well, I really hope that Chona and I can move that call permanently.
00:46:41 - mark sweet
So I would be meetings are hard.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But Thursday, I can do Thursday or Friday that week. And if Dan can't, you and I can dig into this stuff more. You want to pick something?
00:46:55 - mark sweet
Yeah, that's fine.
00:46:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, December, December 4th. It's my oldest daughter's birthday, and I will have been, roll this into me. This isn't about that. I'm telling you something. Sorry. On December 4th, I will have been a mother for four years, 24 years, 24 years, years. Yeah. Speak to you. Okay. Anyway, especially because I had a miscarriage before every single one of my children. I've been pregnant 10 times. have four babies. I worked for them. They were hard. All right. So Friday or Thursday, the only call I have to do is my 12 o'clock with Dan. And then as of right now, I still have Chona at 6 p.m. Friday, I don't have anything at all. They're totally fine.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
There's an interview before or after Dan, whatever like to keep that open. Yeah, that's totally fine.
00:47:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So let me move you. and if Dan accepts then yay and if not he'll just be you and me after that he'll be back to normalcy yeah okay well then we still have christmas week oh i don't think that that's going to be a problem for me actually i don't know about you guys well on december 5th you might have to move and time it later because i'm going have a small time change during the 16th and 23rd but small time change yeah oh we're in japan oh okay yeah that's a big time change well no not for us specific um it's a 17 hour time change oh well but it's it's fine because the new one is like just early morning there and it's fine yeah okay um so december 20 Third.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
The 16 and 23, we'll figure out. The twelve should be fine. If there's some issue, I'll let you know.
00:49:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The twelve.
00:49:12 - mark sweet
The sixteenth and twenty third. You mean it?
00:49:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, the 12th. M you mean. Yes. I thought you said 12 doesn't like the date. The 12th of my dude. We don't mean on the 12th. Okay. All right. Well, we'll do all of that. as it comes up. Okay, so I'm just looking at some of the stuff that we've been doing. Did you do any more research on the gift boxes since we talked about the monthly subscription thing?
00:49:55 - mark sweet
So yes, I also talked to a couple of different doctors that I'm. fairly friendly with just kind of pick their brains of what they would like. It's interesting that the smaller ones are like, now the doctor makes the decision. The bigger ones are like, yeah, I know the front desk like hands out cards. So, not surprisingly, we're gonna have to think about who gets what.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:50:18 - mark sweet
The one that was like, yeah, look, I would love to just get wine in the mail. Like, I'm stoked for why. No one is like, we eat healthy, like, I would like fruit and then staff would like fruit. The ones like girls in front like, I don't care. So it was helpful, not helpful, but helpful. All of them kind of report the same thing of in the last three years, they've seen the number of things they call unattached, basically unrepresented clients way down compared to what they saw three years ago. And the ones that they are seen that are unrepresented are not cases we would. Take.
00:51:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is doctor's offices.
00:51:10 - mark sweet
These are chiropractors.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:51:15 - mark sweet
And those are the ones who really target me. Like I love Fuji, right? Like we love working with him, but the chance that he comes across the case that doesn't already have an attorney attached to it is super low unless it's a personal friend.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So where are there other doctors that might. Yes. Okay.
00:51:39 - mark sweet
But there's a lot of them that will want things for that. Yeah. That I am not getting near. I understand it's legal in Arizona. I'm still getting near.
00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like ER doctors?
00:51:57 - mark sweet
Yep. want another super fun car? and somebody will pay that. Oh, yeah.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can't really compete with that or won't compete with that. Okay. Well, Dr. Rufundrels want a huge thing. They're not, but I don't just need things. Sorry, what?
00:52:27 - mark sweet
I would love to find a way to increase that. mean, we're at one Dr. Rufundrel, this one, that's low. And so if we're sending so much business out, I mean, there's plenty of people who say, you know, look, for every two I send you, I'm expecting to get one back. But the quality of those cases usually aren't aren't there.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:55 - mark sweet
So I'm just trying to find other ways to generate cheaper cases. a lack of better term.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:03 - mark sweet
And there's, you know, other benefits that the doctors always like you're going get your bills and reports faster, we can ask for certain things like, hey, can you squeeze in this patient or whatnot, you know, things that if you don't have a good relationship or, you know, we didn't pay them well. I'm sorry, I can't, you know, put that person in say we're full.
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:26 - mark sweet
So it's more just constant process and constant ups and downs. And it's always how it's been with these different, you know, providers and vendors, but we've talked about it before, we've gone, we've done stuff, we haven't done stuff with how can we keep putting it.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if you found somebody like an order we are downer that worked? I don't know if they could do this or not. Worked at the hospital and paid them to rock their car with your stuff.
00:53:56 - mark sweet
So it's a little little tricky. Because you are not supposed to solicit clients at a emergency scene, if you will, directly. And directly is the key word, because the TVs that are on an emergency room have lower ads on them, right? Right. There's bus benches outside the hospitals, which have lower ads on them. So it's not impossible, but it's, uh, it's right. It's online and it could work. I'm not saying I can't, but, you know, what's the difference in hiring a jam to do that or just, you know, buy a junk car and just park you there every day?
00:54:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's going to get towed and, you have, it has to have a reason to be there parking is usually not right out from where you'd be able to see it. But, like, depending on what the major hospitals are, is there a fast food place or something? where you could pay one of their employees and to wrap their car and so it gets seen frequently by people in the vicinity who just visited somebody who were in the hospital and got in a wreck and like it's really just top of mind and where are people from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented but represented where are they wherever they're at that's where you want to be but it doesn't have to necessarily be the same places that everybody else is like how can you think outside of the box a wrapped car like thoroughly wrapped could say a lot could catch a lot of attention and you do that at times a few around hospitals not in them not on the parking lot but in locations that are close to it where people might even be stopping or people visiting might be stopping like you know what I mean like is in a high-pop We did area. The fact that the chance that that doesn't get you a case from time time, know, buildings, you know, why else would you be doing that? Right. Yeah. So, I mean, and that wouldn't cost that much. Really, like somebody's driving their car anyway. And you pay for the rap, whatever that costs, you know, maybe $1,000. And then you pay them to drive it and say, well, I'll pay $500 a month to have your car wrapped. And then how many times could you do that? And basically have a walking advertisement that's going everywhere all the time with your ads on it. And it's moving. And if you're talking about a fast food worker, guess who they're around all the time. The poor people that need representation if they get in the break. And probably the ones are likely to get in Iraq, lower income, more drugs, working later nights, driving while exhausted or intoxicated. It's just it's the status quo. It's just that's that's just the reality of it. I'd try it. I put my knee in it.
00:57:25 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's worth trying. We tried the LED trucks. I don't know if you know it at all.
00:57:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's an LED truck.
00:57:33 - mark sweet
They're a box truck covered in LED TV.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I'm going to go around sporting events.
00:57:40 - mark sweet
Huh, never generated. But I keep doing it. So that way, someone said I saw you in the billboard or saw you when I was driving. And they really maybe thought someone else that has a similar name hypothetically. I got to do those. I don't know where they saw it. Right.
00:58:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but in terms of like where to run ads, where to put ads with their physical or digital, where are people going from the time they get in a wreck to the time they get represented? Yeah. And is the time of representation window decreasing? Probably is based off of what you just said. What was that window? What is that window? we know? And what does that mean? Why did it decrease? Are people more aware?
00:58:44 - mark sweet
people? Awareness has definitely gone up.
00:58:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. And it will, and in this, because we live in an information world, right? social aspect of it means people are telling their stories and other people are learning from other people. stories and so they you know maybe they didn't know a brother or uncle or somebody in their immediate family but because of Facebook they know somebody that they don't even really know but now they're like what I know how to handle this because um but even being I mean driving how many billboards now or ball from billboards well can you can you run ads in and on podcasts are there podcasts like true crime podcast that freaking so many people huh yeah the geotarget the what target do you target you wouldn't want to add right no right but big podcasts might do geotargeting ads geotargeted ads that um you can get multiple platforms too so you know we have not talked about that that's not traditional radio I wouldn't consider it traditional radio because of the the social aspect of it. And I think most people aren't going to skip a really short ad like that. don't think you can in podcasts. Yeah. Are your competitors doing that? You know, I don't know if they are, but I would imagine the majority of them aren't yet. I don't think that podcasts have been topped very well, but they're going to keep growing. So that's something to look into. If you know what is the highest, you know, time, like when do the most accidents occur? What time of day? What day of the week? Run ads then or right after those times.
01:00:45 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't got we haven't. I'm going to put this on that list.
01:01:03 - mark sweet
2020, which is pretty outdated at this point, found that lawyers spent 400 million on just TV commercials.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On just TV commercials? Yep.
01:01:18 - mark sweet
And then data from sensor towers, so take all that with a large grain of salt, and Morgan and Morgan spent 40.3 million on digital ads in 2023. Oh, sorry. 240 million was just what Morgan and Morgan spent.
01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's? I'm sharing, you know, the thing is, what should I... spreadsheet. I showed it you. was working on earlier this week. just shared that with you. Identify what the time accident to represent.
01:02:43 - mark sweet
Look, everything's worth a shot. We tried the radio thing. That didn't work. Radio clearly works to someone, but didn't work for us. Things are worth trying. I know podcasts usually are
01:03:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I shared this talk with you just so you can just, like, if there's ideas that you have and we haven't talked about it, you can put it here, put it in the parking lot, and if we're, I'll put things in progress if we're working on it, but we'll get a little bit more organized and structured and then think about whether not you'd like to meet one more day a week so that we can just put, we can just be more structured, that we can get more results, there's a lot of things that have to be solved that only you inside of your company can solve, you don't have another person that's there doing this. There's just a lot, like, you have a big organization there's a lot of opportunity, there's a sufficient amount of risk, there's enough systems, there's enough departments, like there's a lot to be done. And I don't think you really have anybody leading any of it super well. think Mary does her part. I don't think that's nearly enough. So another hour a week, you know, if we did that for six months, we can make them significant momentum, I think, towards things, but it really should start with first. What does it look like to take care of everyone? Who is everyone? They need to have names or a very distinct description, right? And if it's everyone at Sweet Log, if they're all the same, if Mary is her own, you know, be really specific about the people and the categories of people because how you take care of them should look different, right, for all of them. And then we can like, okay, what does that number look like? Where are we at now? What's the gap that we have to bridge? How long would it take us to get there? And then we run every decision that we make through the filter of does that slow down our goal? Does that speed up our goal? Does that get in the way of it? Does that aid it? Take us off track? Any of the things? So start there and this is a good time of year to really be pondering that type of stuff. Naturally, people become more introspective this time of year. So, which is probably what's what's already happening with you it just it just does winter that you guys don't really have it but but it does it we have less sunshine that's a real impact um but the holiday is coming the end of the year closing you know there's there's a lot of different signals that we have that we may not have personally and purposefully given energy too but we're affected by them anyway so anyway it's just a good time to capitalize that while you're on some walks maybe um and if you get some thoughts maybe you can leave yourself an audio recording or you can drop me uh audio message or something like that and just kind of bring down to a text or signal or wherever or and no not signal if it disappears uh audio text though and uh let's let's do some planning and reverse engineer from the things that matter most at the life level because business is just a vehicle to get you there. Yep. I need to wrap up because I gotta go check on my little pole and get some stuff going but what's that?
01:07:22 - mark sweet
I'm gonna head home, it's only office.
01:07:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yes. What it was like a baklava hamburger.
01:07:29 - mark sweet
What was that? Uh, so I just got followed up so they make like maledo cups.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did that? Mhm. Did you just tell me you did that?
01:07:41 - mark sweet
I didn't eat followedo. I bought the pre-made followedo and I made ground beef with.
01:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You cooked?
01:07:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, I can cook. China can't cook. I can cook.
01:07:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, We know that like this has been since day one like this is not a surprise. Not like I thought she could cook like. Yeah, no. Love that that's funny though. Okay. Well whenever I come with me you guys you guys are you're making me dinner. So there All right, well head home, and I I'm not worried about it, I do think you know she's in a new season and Mike and And It's important to take that into account two kids changes you two kids and settling down with a man changes you and But I think those differences were already there that it's just the gap is getting bigger and it's okay we just need to create the the proper dynamic and then encapsulate it and let it let it stay there and It will create happiness for her and you and she'll still be useful, but I I do think that the the The way that you identify it probably should shift a little bit. I really can't speak until we have a much more in-depth conversation about the logistics. With the one hour that we have and how much we share of it with Dan, it's really hard for me, again, with the size of your organization and all of the moving parts to basically I get half an hour a week with it and it's just not enough to be really effective. So that's, I'm not going to be looking for any new clients, I've got all the things that I'm working on, but I would give more time to sweet loss.
01:09:39 - mark sweet
Were you able to hire that one person that you were trying to hire?
01:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but she was just not able to be consistent and reliable anyway, but what I did do is partner up with a lady who's been around as long as I have and so it's really kind of fulfilling and satisfying. I'm home by myself all the time, and I'm waiting. social for that. getting to have her has been has been helpful too. I'm still not in the surplus that I want to be, but I don't think I'm very far from that. So I'm glad for that. But yeah, that was just another reason I just I don't want different people. I got so blessed with the amazing people I have. If there was somebody just, you know, a magical fit. I'd work with them, but like I really particular about my people and I've just kept them a long time and I'm not looking for anybody new, but to be able to serve better and definitely be down for that. And and I have not been able to do what I wanted to do here anyway. So when you're ready for it, I want to do I think that there is so much more structure that we could put in place. And I also think that I could help with the mental load that you have and help you do than things more consistently, because we do have so many things that you're doing constantly. I don't think any of it is getting done as well as it could be because you're so divided.
01:11:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, definitely more the key directions.
01:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Plus, Mark calls make me smile. So I like how I would have more of that in my life. I think it's a thing. No, you always make me smile. You also make me annoyed sometimes.
01:11:32 - mark sweet
That's OK.
01:11:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the feeling is mutual. You don't have to.
01:11:40 - mark sweet
I just to just want to bring it better. that's what everything just comes down to. And you know that about me when I get frustrated with my reality.
01:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I wouldn't want it to let like if you were not, if you were any way, it wouldn't be real and I have no interest in that. Like if you don't get frustrated, that means you don't. about it. So I don't have no interest in that either. think you do great. I think that you're awesome. think everybody that works with you is lucky. I think your chona is lucky. think you're lucky because she's sweet and smart and funny and feisty and she'll keep you on your toes. your kids.
01:12:24 - mark sweet
Let's go home. All right. Have a good night, Mark. Okay. Bye.

## Quote 6

So I don't know if we can just do a quick check in this week. I was all ready to work. I got tons for you. OK. All right. Well, actually the good news about that is that I wrote all of it out. So I can send that to you. Let's see. So one thing I would like you to do. So I've been kind of looking at the macros, but there's definitely the thing that stands out the most is when you go to bed.
00:00:36 - Michael’s iPhone
When I go to bed now.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So have you given any thought to trying to make that consistent? Obviously you've got the baby. So what are your thoughts about? Does anything stand out to you very quickly of you could probably do this a little bit better and be more consistent about when you go to bed.
00:01:01 - Michael’s iPhone
before the baby came I was I think I just talked to you like two times but we're Esther and I were both making it up for to get into bed by 10 p.m. and then wind down for an hour and then try you know be asleep by 11 but yeah since the baby it's so anyway yeah I think once the baby gets on our sleep schedule when she hits I think what is it five months old then Esther and I both because Esther has to do it too otherwise I never do it so yeah we did yeah before the baby came we did make like a like we didn't make it a routine to get in bed by 10 o'clock okay and so so I'm tabling that a little bit right now at least well we'll talk about it more when when you get your helper and as the baby gets there's not like a set time but as soon as her tummy's big enough to hold enough milk to help her sleep through the night that makes a big difference so and that is a case-by-case kind of
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
basis and it also has to do with the nutrition of the milk. There's all these different things. So Yeah, we think that'll be about like December.
00:02:09 - Michael’s iPhone
We're going to do the full because that's when Emmy at five months, Emmy was sleeping eight hours, 10 hours at night. So we think with this one, December, we'll be able to put her down and you know, let me just tell you, there's a lot of variety with children that it be earlier. It could be earlier.
00:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. So just the biggest thing is just kind of keep it in the back of your mind. Like the goal is try to be more consistent about bedtime and also know that whatever you can do to rather than take your cue from the baby, you want to try to give the cue. There's give and take. We have to, you know what I mean? You can't coerce a baby or anything like that. But there's something profound about being intentional and trying to create good sleep hygiene. And really, it's the intentional thing more than anything. It's the intention of, rather than receive signals, what can we do to engineer getting to bed in a more consistently early time because you definitely sleep longer when to show a rest to rest less and restful sleep is pretty consistent across the board. I definitely do think that when you're very low on protein and carbs and fat, just have a very light meal, your sleep tends to suffer. So be mindful of that. I've seen that pattern show a few times, but there are so many other things that can be taking into account on those days, and maybe you didn't exercise as much those days, and so what I would like to do is have you give me a very short and you can use audio dictation and put it into a cell in this spreadsheet, whatever is the easiest way. But you can also track exercise and lose it. So what I would love to do for just a few weeks, and then really we'll have enough information that you can just make decisions about how you will know what the things are that impact or sleep the most, like napping. So I hate napping, like I've said, but I have the most productive days when I nap, really annoys me. But it's true, they do. I kill it on math days. Anyway, so if we write down what your active calories are for the day, so your apple watch or your or ring would both track that, I think aura is more accurate, but I don't know if you wear it during the day. And let's compare that to sleep and what you're eating also. So possibly your eating less because you're moving less on those days. There could be other factors that have an impact on it. But let's just see what the relationship is for a few more weeks. I look at it just a little bit more for a few more weeks and see what we can figure out in terms of, okay, if I do this, I have this, you know what I mean? Because you can't fix all the things. You can just learn what things make an impact. So if you're really, really tired, you know, you can stack the odds with exercise, eating, sunshine, or taking an app when you need to catch up or power through something, you know what the things are that you can do for you because you've seen it in your own body that is going to help you be as productive as possible and also just not, you know, and it's stuck all week. mood definitely impacted too. And ability to deal with stress. So let's say all of those things are going on and your sleep is deprived and the baby's really sick for a while or ester sick for a while. So if you're not getting good sleep, Your ability to cope with that is Drastically diminished which means your ability to support them as drastically diminish which means you got to figure out how to get rested Very quickly no matter what because that's actually the best way to help them. You know what I mean?
00:06:13 - Michael’s iPhone
So all those things Okay, so I did I had a couple of days where I was That thing about my QME SIBTF work So I finished all seven of the reports, and then I did turn in the model I didn't train it to do the whole report, but I did train it to do one Subsection of the discussion and it I'm surprised like I took like an hour to feed it the reports and and Examples and snippets and then I loaded it and then it wasn't working and I was really upset like it wasn't I didn't do anything that I said and then I realized I was using the general public prompts. Oh Like my own GPT and then ask that. Yeah, so then after that, it worked. So it was a big help.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So one of the things I want you to do is, as we go through that and you do more of it, I want you to figure out and try to kind of project, this is how much time has saved you, this is how much stress has saved you. Because when you make that correlation back to coaching, you want to look at, okay, where's where's the benefit in this so that you keep the thing because we all need somebody that we talk to consistently, that is not biased, that's not in our business, that's not, you know what I mean? And also, that holds you accountable, that doesn't let you escape out of things, but also makes you feel safe enough to show up and tell the truth. And even when you're being held accountable, isn't too awfully painful, hopefully.
00:07:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I honestly like that GPT thing until you held me accountable to it. Like, it was something I knew I was like, you know, it should take an hour to do this. I just, I'd, for the last, you know, year and a half, I've known about strategy. Yeah, I just didn't like, oh, no, too much time. But yeah, I mean, just just holding me accountable and then saying, you know, that's my homework. Yeah, I was like, oh, got to get this done. So Saturday night, I sat there and I trained it and I did it. And yeah, I'm glad I did now. Now I think that section of the report, it'll pay dividends now.
00:08:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So do you think, okay, well, let's talk about next Monday because we didn't line that up before we get to anything else because I would like you to get back to Emi. Okay. So you were telling me next week, can you just remind me?
00:08:40 - Michael’s iPhone
Let's see. So yeah, one Monday, no, no, no, Monday is fine, right?
00:08:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think.
00:08:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Is it? Yeah, it was, it was this Monday. That's why we're talking today.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the week after that is an issue.
00:08:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no, no, the September 6th.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my one Monday.
00:09:02 - Michael’s iPhone
I have to work on September, okay, September 16th.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we can talk about that later. So if next week is good for the normal time, can you be at your computer at that time? Yeah, okay, because I would like to what I would really like to do is look at your systems for how you track your businesses for Q and E and for July medical. I'd like to ask a little bit more about Delto and really try to start diving into the business stuff more. I don't know how much of it will do because we're taking a systematic approach to the things that have the biggest impact, which is why we started with sleep hygiene, just kind of accountability processes, and then getting into where your time goes, which is what led us to the chat GPT conversation, because there's an activity that you have to do. You hate doing. How can we optimize that? So I do want to spend a little bit time in a chat GPT session. with you, watching what you've done, seeing if there's anything I can do to improve that process for you, and we'll just spend just a few minutes every week just until you've got a good system of this is really helping you and especially with that one particular attorney that is a pain in the for you, my mouth, pain in the butt, seeing what we can do to kind of reduce that friction so that you're never just sitting there with 15 cases that could be, or however many it was that could be making you 15,000 minimum a pop, we want to figure out all of that, and then the next thing is, you know, hitting some of the goals, so you have the goal of wanting to get 400 leads or something a month, on a second, referrals a month, but I'm also making the decision, do you hire another clinician? Well, there's some math that has to be done, and that also requires the report getting sent to you on a monthly basis, so that's That's an assignment we already have. So all of these things kind of stack on each other. And as they get done, that's what happened. So did you ask Esther's manager to do that? Did you have that conversation?
00:11:14 - Michael’s iPhone
No, we haven't, I haven't done that yet.
00:11:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:19 - Michael’s iPhone
That's the one about the reports, the, the utilization and the lottery pick that one.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll actually do that today. I'm just, but when I'm driving home, I'm supposed to chat with her about, I had, I had, I worked yesterday and the day before. And so I had, there's an issues that popped up. So I, I'll, I'll actually do that when I'm headed home today from the beach. Okay. on the call with the manager.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've talked about this for two weeks. So by next week, now, now the penalty kicks in. I don't think you should kick in this week because you did, to me, I think I liked to prioritize one particular thing. We're only going to give you one. on penalty that you can have each week. That one was right. That was draft five of them using print.
00:12:06 - Michael’s iPhone
And you did seven, you said? I think I did seven. And then I actually finished two more for two other attorneys.
00:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I'm happy with that growth.
00:12:16 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll see what happens when they when he comes back. But yeah, he should be able to give me feedback about all seven.
00:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I'll be able to feed that back in the model and tell what he said. Exactly, exactly, exactly. So my focus is less about, you know, how could we penalize Fuji and make him feel bad about what didn't get done and really focus on what you did do right. And what I want you to take from this too is how you can frame it when when you have conversations with other people and you feel bad about what you didn't do. I want you to focus on what you did. And this isn't justification or anything else like that. It's prioritization. It's being intentional about what matters most. None of us can do. all the things. But if we do the things that are most important, and you having a stack of work that needs to get done and not doing it because you don't want to, but also not getting that money for your family, not being reliable to Frank as a referral partner, which could cost your business. That's an unacceptable kind of thing in our lives, right? Either you should not to do it, and then you just cut ties and you don't do it, or you do it and you do it right, you know, and you do it in a timely manner. So to me, that was the coup for the week, and that's something to celebrate. I do want you to get the, yes, good job. I forgot you like those, so good job. am really, truly, honestly, placating.
00:13:43 - Michael’s iPhone
Good job.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. That was the priority.
00:13:47 - Michael’s iPhone
It did feel good to have those off my plate. Yes. And now that I've done so many in a row, I was getting, know, I'm a lot faster. By the seventh one, it was a lot quicker. So yeah, I'm hoping now I can, I can get closer to getting these done on the day of because all my other chemis, the other 60, 70 reports I do a month, I get them done, you know, within the visit actually, when I'm with the patient.
00:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:14:14 - Michael’s iPhone
But these, these, because they involve every single body part, they take a little longer, but I think I'm closer to getting it pretty quick.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm really interested to see how Frank responds to that. And I'm very interested to see just how the process of feeding that feedback back to chat TPT does. Yeah, that's a major win. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm just going to send the rest of this stuff an email. That was the one accountability thing that I really was focused on. And I feel like that made a dent for you.
00:14:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, it was fun. I mean, like you said last week, you know, maybe if we make it like a little more of a game, you know, rather than just a slog through work. And so yeah, it fun because When I, when I was like, okay, I guess I'm forced to make the GPT model, it made me like, make the GPT model and that was interesting to me, you know, and so, even though I was like, I don't want to be doing this, I did it. And so it was, it was interesting when I was trying to train the model, because I wanted to do it right.
00:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The system was like, this is what you have to do, Fuji, if you want my money, do this and you're like, I'm going to change the system.
00:15:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So, that's my favorite game. love that game. How do I beat the system?
00:15:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make it mine and be like, this is my house.
00:15:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, and I went ahead and actually, because I did that, I built a second GPT custom model to do one part of my normal, the normal everyday Q and E reports that are little challenging for me. So, it has a little work to do that part. It takes little more finesse, but I'll keep working on that model.
00:15:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Okay. So. I will send you an email with the focus and I will spend a good chunk of our time just really organizing that. So this is the thing I was telling you is sometimes calls aren't going to work out but you're still going to get my time because I'm going to take it and I'm going to put it into a really structured email that still is effective at moving the needle forward this week. So you still get your investment out of me but also you get the flexibility of...
00:16:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay, worry about that.
00:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I know that but that's my way of showing up at being consistent, right? Thank you. So because that's me honoring.
00:16:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Go ahead. How did you get the... So I got from my bookkeeper all my July medical... I think it was the July medical books. The balance sheet and the profit and loss.
00:16:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I only see... Oh, there it is. She didn't scroll down. I realized that there were multiple things in here. Okay. So, yeah, I saw, oh good, okay, P and L's by the month.
00:17:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So, have you read it? Yeah, if you want to, maybe, yeah, after the call, if you want to take a look at that for a few minutes and see if that's the right, because I also have it in Microsoft Excel. But the Excel sheets are not summarized. these PDFs are some of the rooms that I put together with the bookkeeper. So, it would be a little more succinct for me to read, which I still haven't read. But the idea was to make the PDFs.
00:17:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, these are probably the ones that I'll use the most. But I always like to take the 30,000 foot view and then drill down also and see everything and go, okay, this is the most useful version of the data. sometimes there's extra data sparks questions I may not have known to ask. Sure, sounds great. Okay, so I'll go ahead and write up the email. you. So is Emmy, did she just turn three or she gonna be four?
00:18:04 - Michael’s iPhone
It's today. Yeah. So she just turned three today. And then I'm still probably gonna take it to two at four o'clock. And then I'm gonna bring cupcakes for the class. There's like, you know, eight other kids.
00:18:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, she's so precious.
00:18:20 - Michael’s iPhone
So precious. then my mom's next week. Yeah, my mom's here. And then my my sister brought her two kids.
00:18:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're playing back there. I love your family, Fuji.
00:18:34 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I completely forgot. So I was like, what am I gonna do for Emmy's birthday?
00:18:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, let's pull her out of school and take her to the beach. So I don't think you can go wrong with that. So good job. job, dad. You guys are awesome.
00:18:48 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. need that. need to plan better. Maybe next year, you can help me plan this or set a reminder to plan there.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Little it's so simple. It's so simple. This is probably one of the best things you can do because it's family, it's memories, it's nature, it's pure.
00:19:03 - Michael’s iPhone
There's not a whole lot of pure in the world. Now, when she gets older, that's a whole another ballgame dad. Real birthday party.
00:19:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and peer pressure and pleasing friends, and it's a whole different kind of thing. And also, well, at one point, let's have a conversation about what nobody talks about and teaches us unless you paid attention to it in psychology. quickly, kids start leaning on their peer groups and pulling away from parents. We have these conversations and we think that it's the parents. It's not. It's human nature. Kids start pulling away by age seven. By age 10, they're leaning very heavily on peer groups. by age 14, it's pretty much 90% peer groups and not talking to the families. Now, of course, there are outliers, but yeah, nobody prepares you for that emotionally. So keep that in mind and really. please look at this little time because it changes really fast.
00:20:04 - Michael’s iPhone
That sounds good to me.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, take care.
00:20:07 - Michael’s iPhone
Please go inside your family.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send you a good email and you have

Hello.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's up?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not my energy levels because I've been getting up at 5.30 in the morning for the last couple days because I have a seminary student now.
00:00:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You have a what? Seminary. oh, oh. I thought you said something about a son. I'm like, wait, what? have a son in love. I thought you were going to say to jump into your ice bath and then expose yourself to sunlight.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you're not.
00:00:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Never. You're not doing that.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm using myself.
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was like, wait a minute. Never no matter how many times that should tell me it would be good for me and a rim hop and blah, blah, blah. No, never.
00:00:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done it.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, I want to send this to you. I'm texting it. These are my past clients, current friends, very smart people who are
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
um they used to do before covid they were agency um and for yoga studios and amazing like they spent a little bit time creating marketing campaigns and they blew these brand new so it was like um great the guys that make smart tools are your clients yes oh that's funny i know david what's his name bought this and met like no as a customer oh yeah yeah he met them at the high level event he met Jason and chandel uh i believe so yeah and i think he's a subscriber so but mostly his daughter is the sort of the face of that but yeah when david and her went to uh Austin i forget where the where the thing was but yeah he he was so funny he goes i met the number one affiliate for high level and i go uh cooch and he goes yeah um Did you know that? like, I know him. I've known him for years. He's like, that guy's the number one affiliate. I go, I didn't know that. I know he was partners, maybe with the number one. Anyway, David's a subscriber that Jason also had, uh, he had this one thing that it to no longer needed, but I almost bought it be. I mean, because there's somebody else that does something very, very, very similar. I'm a subscriber of the other guy. I'm not a subscriber of Jason. David's a subscriber of Jason. I'm a subscriber of, uh, the other dude. can't remember his name, but I use power tools or something else like that too. It's very similar. Yeah, I have that one. David has, David has Jason and David matches.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So Jason's a beast. He's super tall and she's really short and they always did video even though Tina never did. I'm really good about it now. And she used to be a hairdresser. And they. They used to do media buying, but they did all the campaigns. They created all the marketing and really just the whole growth business plan. And then they did the ads and they wrote the copy, they tracked everything. And they did amazing for these yoga studios that then COVID came and shut everything down and went to here. But Jason, they're both brilliant. Chandel loves the systems and the marketing. Well, he loves marketing too, but so he loves marketing and the tech. And he is really brilliant at creating the tech and snapshots and creating the automation and she loves the marketing, but does the customer support, the hiring, the deadlines and all that other stuff. and I've watched their kids grow up and yeah, anyway, but you know, to me, they're kind of like under the radar, but although I've I mean, their group is just growing.
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I see people in here that I know that have done a good job. He gets called out fairly frequently in the main group for a couple of his bits and pieces. Oh, does he? Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's awesome. Yeah, right. you're saying, hey, man, the other guy.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're like the two go to the tools. got, oh, wait, wait, wait, okay.
00:04:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm like, no, it's a wife. Okay, I just want to make sure I don't save you. Yeah, I can't think of the other guy's name, but yes.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think I got their stuff and they offer like, they call it like white glove service or something like that, where you don't have to do anything for your people and they'll do it all and.
00:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, that's yet another guy. Yeah, that's like, it's Stanley. There's two of those.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine. There's like two of everyone. Well, what I love about these two most is that, I mean, they're just super smart. And I don't know, like Jason just gets excited about this. But he has the balance of Chandel, who is like, okay, but we need it to be this and just kind of whatever. And they also have Tina thoughts in the back of their head, although I'm telling them, okay, don't do this, don't do this. I think that's fun. So anyway, but like, as far as like collaborating type, they're just, they're, they're mom and dad. They're at hockey games all the time. He cooks like crazy, amazing food. She was an air dresser, so she still loves all the beauty stuff. Anyway, they're just so laid back down to earth and they're in this world, but they're not schmuckery's like, just, you know?
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do. Yeah, because I think that, you know, the good thing about high level is that the people that got in early, like then, like a lot of these tools providers, the early onset people, they were solving real problems. With real solutions, and now you have the hacks coming now you have the this Not just the bang whiz and you're like okay, whatever and it's someone that's been using high level for like a week And they bought some of our snap shot. No reselling it Thank you. Yeah, okay No, thanks Oh God now what happened Do that again somehow the audio button is just like Below my browser cuz I'm not looking at zoom.
00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was behind my browser, but apparently it was just underneath it and so I was clicking Anyway, they had given me a high level account, but she was like tini you should just really have an agency account like Okay, I didn't think about anything. I'm like I just don't even want high level whatever But now that you're talking about it, and I know and you got that one snapshot. I really do think it will be in my best interest to understand this for I just see their growth like I was turned off by the whole Frankenstein code. Yeah, but what I see now is almost like I'm trying to think of the word but it's like socialism. Like I mean open sources Frankenstein code, Franken code basically all the things that are built off of it and so and also I'm telling myself there's no first of all I don't like anything being housed under one roof but this really isn't that because let's say high level did something really stupid and just blew it up whatever there's now this whole community of people who for sure even if they're not coders have coders who can very quickly pivot and splinter off a whole lot of related things because we're all now having thoughts we've never had before, it used to be owned by an entrepreneur or an infusion soft, and you couldn't compete with them. And now this is like a building full of all of the greatest minds helping to build it. so it doesn't feel as much of a death wrap is like, anyway, something else.
00:08:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So only way goes sideways. And I'm not sure it can even go sideways, but what will be inevitable.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And for those of us that have been in the game long enough, it's like in a huge, a huge enough.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Remember when everyone was an infusion soft affiliate? Oh, is same thing's gonna happen here. Eventually that affiliate play no longer exists and they get rid of it. And then that turns into we're gonna raise the price.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes.
00:08:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's it. Here's down the road, right?
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. because the pace of everything is exponentially faster and increasing. I don't, I don't think that timeline.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I see them doing it right now to through these add-ons, right? So a perfect example would be their, their, I think I'm not exactly sure what the relationship is here. So they have the conversation AI add-on. It's not have gone too deeply into this. It's not clear to me if it's theirs or if they have a licensing deal with someone else and it's, it's that. But either way, that add-on per account, 40 bucks.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's a huge markup. That's a huge price. I even know what the markup is. So I see them doing that. Like they, they create certain add-ons and that's actually a way to get more money without raising the price. I'm like, they can do that too.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I see that. I mean, because that's what everybody's doing is talking on to it. So anyway, but bottom line is I definitely do want to get into it and learn it because the one thing I do know is that somehow I'll think of a question somebody hasn't thought yet and then they'll be a day on and be like, you'll have a thought. There's no possible way I would think what you think. I cannot even come close to the things that you think. But when it can be as a catalyst for you thinking what you're thinking, I'll do that. Check it out. Yeah, so did you push that button yet?
00:10:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I didn't, because when I went to push it last night, my browser would not cooperate and I'm like, I'm just going to shut this computer off.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a sign that today is over.
00:10:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't even close the time. oh my god, I'm going to close this time. But I will set it up right after this fall. Because it's Thursday, and it's Paul's day. It's Paul's in random tasks day.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so there you go you know what i don't know if you would ever need it like i need it because i do but i do so many different things but you do so many different things and it is this extension called work on i'm sure i've told you i've used it yeah i use it religiously do you i i didn't see the i always have two browsers open and they're color coded because they're each in different google accounts which just makes it easy because i always have two i always have my mission tab open constantly because when i get a few breaks it and also it just serves as a reminder hey i've got to go get some work done there yeah so feel 12 hours doesn't seem like a lot but it is a lot but then i got it yeah and it also has to be concentrated work so anyway Um, so I have those two open, but then so I can switch in between each client, but then I have one that's like for my course and ones that's just AI research because I have all these different tabs that I'm looking at and one for finances and, um, one that's like, I have few miscellaneous, I have one for school because I'm back in school and Etsy and like all kinds of different things and it's so much easier to switch back and forth. And I do catch myself opening something because I'm in a browser and I'm not in that tab and like, oh, switch it. But then I can just easily go move that tab to the workspace that it belongs. You have to pay for it. If you're only using five spaces, it's not worth it.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but right. But you could also do like, just go, this is but like, the way that I end up being effed is like, I'll have essentially three workspaces open across 20 times. And it's like, oh, all this ninja stuff should be over here. And then over here should be empire. And then over here should be fan flowy. And then what I end up with is just the row of tabs and they're not even next to each other.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, which one is it? So, so you're selling me? Yes. Because also I have my computer is amazing and very fast. It can handle a ton of browsers. But it's browser windows, but there's still a limit to it. And I am one to push those boundaries. So this makes it easy. And I don't want to have to bookmark everything. And I lose stuff. And I don't lose things anymore. But also it serves because I've got that row of spaces on the left. Like, Oh, yeah, go check on that. Oh, I need to go check on that. So because I'm always in there choosing a space every day, I'm also getting a reminder of the things that I look at and work on most without having to be in a company. Completely separate app like a reminder app or my calendar or something else going.
00:14:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, go look at that So anyway, I've been you know you can you oh you don't have back, but you can reduce like Okay, you can reduce that down right so that it's then in the bar and you're like, oh, that's my throat That's my basis work. I'm and then I could just launch that right. I literally have one called basis Okay, I'm gonna have to go. gonna have to this might be what I do this afternoon because I it was like I actually started feeling that it's the perfect time to start feeling that this week damn this is getting You know, it doesn't work and then I get to this place where I have to use the one tab because everything's just so janky and Then one tab reduces everything down to links, and then I'm like I never go back to it No, like they're there right. That's exactly the problem.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm like I never go back to this That's why this is such and Although
00:15:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's like a cleanse, like, yeah, but that's always bad, though.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you need the tabs. Look, we're a tap your brain has multiple tabs open, your computer has multiple tabs open. It's just, it's the way your brain works, but I'm being able to switch from different devices. could log into my Chrome account on somebody else's computer, log into work on it and have all my stuff anywhere and just what you can.
00:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's a problem I run to run into when I'm making music is because that computer is not my computer. But I have to sign in sometimes is me and sometimes as I have a shared account for Apple for that. And so, so it also has a email address. So sometimes I have to use that, but 99% I use me.
00:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All you have to have is have whatever browser you're using install. We're gonna as a plug in on that machine. And then it's all into your Google account and you have all of your tabs open, right?
00:16:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dealing.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I just might be pop open as soon as you click on the thing.
00:16:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's interesting.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yup.
00:16:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need to. I do that too. I'll sometimes be on my laptop and then I switch to that computer and I have to look it up again.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. It stays. It's transverse.
00:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so what will happen though is I'll go on my laptop. So then all my bookmarks are inside Workana because that's the other thing because then I have to redo bookmarks and but I don't because I'm like I'm not doing that.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you don't and let's say you have a tab that you open frequently but you don't need to have it open all the time is let's say you've got 30 tasks tab work. Yes. Okay. So what you can do is save that as a resource and you can save it as a resource across multiple things. maybe. teamwork across spaces across street law anything else like that and you save it as a resource with one click to multiple workspaces and it's not an open tab but it's still easy for you just to go and click from the work on a home screen. Okay so here's the other thing so like let's say I have the tabs open my mission tab on my desktop and then I go open up my laptop and it says you were already working on this in another location do you want to resume work here and so I can say yes and it just takes over the most recent tabs and then just so the work transfers let's say I closed tabs on the laptop they're closed on the desktop when I come back to it.
00:17:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh wow okay. Interesting.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just client I told him about. He's like yeah it wasn't. I'm like, and you're not using it right.
00:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
promise you because. Right. That's exactly the message I'm getting. But it's also like I just there was no there. That's a perfect example of they don't really tell you I'd use it. Yes. You're like, how am I supposed to use this? Like this is like a mini course, right?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like that's exactly that. And I think I'm like, I need to do some of these little hacks. Let me make sure my daughter's OK. Yes, OK, yeah. When I teach people stuff, because it is these little things.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, Tina, Yeah, yes, but that's the other thing, too.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like finding examples like this because a lot of people have really amazing stuff, whatever it is, do a terrible job of marketing, especially local, like local businesses. I just I look at them and I think I've never seen it out of yours like ever. And I just anyway, whoa.
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, yeah, totally.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Market's best wins.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It markets at all. That's the thing. Speaking of markets and market share.
00:19:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And another 71. How are we doing? I think I did the math roughly a few days ago. We're like, we're up like 16%. So we're gonna we're we're approaching 3.6 million. So we're we're on. I mean, I think we can get back to four because that's was like our apex. And then I'm still some of my Mercer stuff didn't work. And then some of it's not going to work. I got another answer from them today. So for yesterday, so now I got to go check. I set up some new stuff. going to make sure it's working. I think one thing is messed up. I'm going to have to ask them why it's partially working. But I got to peek at it really quick. first but if Mushi's new thing is tracking and the stuff that I overlooked that I added is working and then I got the video thing's the one that's broken I got to get help fixing that then I'm like done as far as like all right I know how to set a custom event Mushi I know how to set these other events these on page events the standard sort of built in which would be the video one then I know how to do sort of the his his ace events set those up don't know how to do them in GDN yet because they weren't working so I haven't taken that up with Melissa yet but if they're working I can get with her and then I need to go I still need to go through one more module now then I can go into the advanced JavaScript and just see if there's which is essentially what I did with Mushi anyway but that was very specific to me I want to see what they say like is there anything from that that makes me go oh that's interesting oh I could do that uh so ideally I would get that done I don't do it today or tomorrow right next week but then we're also going to visit Santa Cruz next Thursday so yeah so I can't be on a conics Thursday although I totally didn't think about that when I put the flight but I'll be on a flight or I'll be touring the campus I'll be doing one of the other I know you don't like calls on other days but can we reschedule yeah we can do it on Friday if you can do it on Friday or okay yeah Friday are gonna still be there because I can move it to Wednesday if you'd rather move in and out Tina boom boom okay we're just doing a tour and getting the lay of the land and then and then in two weeks we go back again for the movement Thursday no on a Saturday
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay cool. I moved it.
00:22:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
then that that one we might stay over.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, would you like it any earlier that day on Friday?
00:22:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can do whatever because that's that's why it opens.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, we'll leave it right there at noon then. Okay. It is moved it in your calendar. right. I'd like to I'm gonna tap.
00:22:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was booking the flights and it was like, okay. And oh wait, that's September 11th.
00:22:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am not flying on that day. Oh my gosh.
00:22:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There. That was like literally about to hit purchase.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go way to say. Ha ha ha. You're like, no.
00:22:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Encore. No, thank you. Yeah. No, I'm looking for that. Any day would be a day to send a message. Right. Probably that. So I don't want to be a part of a message. Thursday it is.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy too how many people had stories of they were supposed to be traveling that day, but something happened or somebody said go or They knew they shouldn't go and like, why am I?
00:23:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so you were about to tell me when you think it was going to get done.
00:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then you. So I'm going to try to get it done next week. So I mean, I could probably watch a bunch of it on those flights, too. So that's ample. Airports are great for that stuff and flight.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My throat is killing me because I almost literally choked to death. I thought I was on a call talking to my friend. And I'm like, I'm really, truly going to die. being here.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just just be aware about to die.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had these capsules and they got wet and they stuck to each other. I'm such a miser. I could swallow that. almost did not able to. And it was mind over matter because I had to keep shoving water down. But the water wasn't going down. And I'm like, it's just coming back up. And I'm I'm just in suffocating. as a role, by the way, especially for an asthmatic when you've suffocated almost to that many times. Well, lovely. Well, I'm okay with it. It hurts now.
00:24:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, well, then it feels like they're still there. That's the worst part.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fortunately, that is not what's happening. Yeah, but it's just like everything just feels like if I swallow again, it feels like I have a sore throat, but I'm for all that it is, I'm like, thank you, God, thank you, God, thank you, God.
00:24:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, not dead, not dead.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, literally. When I could finally talk again, she was just talking, she had no idea. I'm just going here. I can't believe this is happening. Like, and I'm trying to dream what I was soaking wet. Anyway, it was an interesting morning.
00:24:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thought it's your dad.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No draw, though. No, no, no, Exactly. We can just watch ourselves die. I feel like, I don't know, it's just surreal. Anyway, okay, so we're going through that and try to finish it by next week. And then what's the next?
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, ultimately, I would like to have tracking goings that we can go into 2025, right? January, we'd be like, all right, it's a normal year, supposedly. And then we very much know what to expect, right?
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Q, how is it?
00:25:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When not like 25, that's like a penny, but it's like, we're all intent, right? It's like, okay, no COVID, no, no exam changes. That is a change, but it's a positive change. I guess it's not totally normal, it's normal, or, I mean, I'm going to find out how many more that actually is, because I don't know, but the, and then just have, it's like this stuff is going to, should settle down in November, and then where people exit isn't December like all that stuff will happen as as it does But then it's like, okay, where are we really at if we keep this 31? Think I mean, I think 31 is 4 million if I'm not mistaken So it's like we've never got past that I Guess we could but it's not on purpose But if the numbers 31 it's like okay, 31 is the number to be and And then we'll do I wanted to advise a plan based on data shocker to figure out how to beat that number What was See this is why I need to make my dashboard, so Orange new subscriptions, okay, And you think that's for money, okay I Think that's for you know, that's our ideal number based on historical data. It's like that's the best we've ever been and kind of thing. So, we'll see.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just out of Thirty-one puts you over four million.
00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thirty-one, yeah.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Roughly. And we'll find out where if the ceiling is real or if it changes because of all this stuff. So, I just, I'd curiosity, don't know how this works because I don't know what the different sections are. But I wrote how many score releases for CPA Exam 2025. This is the course Becker said, the course sections will be available with continuous testing and 16 different score releases release dates in 2025.
00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The core is odd for in reg.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's four sections in that, right?
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, it'd be other sections. I forget what they're called, but those, Those are probably so all the additional score release. So I guess this is what they're doing. There are now section dedicated score releases. So the score releases that the score release. The core score releases usually where we get our huge bump and that will not be we won't be as effective as much because the number one section is far. So it's still in core. Therefore, their back is gone. Back is going to be those other things. And back is this I think the lowest section. So if anything, if we will either get the same outcomes around the score release or nearly the same, and then you're just going to get all these bonus outcomes around the supplemental or whatever. And there's three tests in that. But you only have to pass one so it's like ISC TCP and something else they pick one they have to pass it We don't really know the failure rates and stuff yet because I'm not people have taken it to fail But that number will be more solidified by Certainly by the end of the year If I add these up, I think it was around 23 and I don't know if this is right But I would imagine What do they call them the other ones?
00:29:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Disciplines the other ones are disciplines 16 And there's no other But unless 21 22 23 24 25 Are these
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, that's this year, right?
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's right, right.
00:30:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why. Those are the remaining ones.
00:30:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. that's all of them. So, I'm pretty sure that's way more core releases and core releases are where we crush.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:30:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so, we should benefit just period, finally, something might go in our favor.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, 16 core releases, how many are there normally?
00:30:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's, there's been no normal, right? Oh, yeah. stopped doing them. Last year, they changed it, right? So, we'd have to go look at like 2019. I'm sure someone still has that post it somewhere, but I don't know about that. I'm That's something. Yeah, that sounds right. It's like, I was going to say, it's like two or three a quarter.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So five more score releases than 2009.
00:31:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Five more core and then totally new ones. Well, not totally new, but they're new as of this year.
00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2018 was 11. I it. I'm thinking 2025. And do you really good for another spending?
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, yeah Does Jeff know how good he has it with his van? Yeah He should just making sure yeah, he just doesn't like He just doesn't like when I say no Don't like it. I already know where your hands is going to be. No, but let me just get it out.
00:32:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go. No Hi Yeah Good like he's waffling on he's waffling on doing the new products.
00:32:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like we are doing it And he tried he tried to argue You know argue his point on monday and he's saying, you know when we did We did the subscription thing. I go dude. Well, we did the subscription thing I knew exactly what was going to happen If we did exactly what was on the sheet and we did you even call the timeline pretty close Yeah, yeah, it was all map. So here I said, I don't know what's going to happen. So he wanted to lower the make of the low end price $47. I'm like, no way, man. That's a bad idea because you're baking in a potential failure. I'm like, it cannot be lower than 67 because worst case scenario is everyone buys the 67 still and we have achieved nothing other than there's now a clear separation between a supplement and a course. And yes, some people will buy the course, but we have no idea. My argument is we raised the base price $10 and then we sell the other one for $87 and I'm sticking to that idea. And we're baking in growth. I mean, Jeff has had a winning idea or two, Oh, yeah, totally.
00:33:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He comes up with stuff that I don't. But when it comes to the math of these types of things, I mean, the odds are in your paper for sure.
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's, I mean, it's come out. She also wasn't understanding, I got, dude, we change the price of a subscription, we are starting at zero. You're literally erasing everything because we have no data on a $47 product. So then you have to wait 18 months based on our AOV or LTV to know what's really happening. go, that is not worth it.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I saw a post of Noreos today with his watercolor.
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you see that? No, I haven't mapped it on the Facebooks at all. What?
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a good distressor, but he's very proud of it. And it reminded me of Eor. So I thought about Mark's view. Terrible. They have that correlation. Yeah. So. It's not, I don't think that this is gossip, can not say anything, but, which is very interesting to me to get to talk to Chona, and I don't know anything about her other than you tell that people said he shouldn't marry her, but she is very enthusiastic. I'm like, is this going to be like when a, you know, husband recommends his wife to something and there's a strange woman, but she is so excited to work with me and so enthusiastic and so open and just really like kind of incredible, like the kind of person like, I just like, I love you, like, you're just so awesome. And anyway, and the first thing, well, the only thing that came up was, she's like, see, have to check my brain and be like, is this okay to share or whatever. This is between you and me and also, I think that is some type one good because of the. don't see intimate level we work with Mark and I mean that as just talking about the hard things that he goes through. We're not the average business people.
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the biggest thing is that she's like his brain is like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all over the place and I could do this and I could do that and she's like I don't understand how that works. I'm like calm down. I don't like you know so he's got these big dreams and big visions and she is just starting to because she's a Filipina woman.
00:36:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Women in general are are bred to do a particular type of thing but especially in certain cultures and definitely in the Philippines and it's not to dream big and do big and act big but she's in this world where she's around very successful people all the time and thinks you know I could have that because Mark encourages or Mark thinks that she can do so anyway I can see how that would there would be a lot of resistance of not knowing how to to be in a world where you come from a culture of, I don't know, not the flash that Mark is around all the time, you know.
00:37:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:37:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, she's just like, I just, and I told her what I would do would bridge would be to bridge the gap between his excitement and his big vision and pace it for her and explain it to her. But I don't think that he can because that's the thing that I do, I think, really well as liaison between different types and personality types. And she's like, oh my gosh, that would be amazing. Anyway, she's, she's excited and I'm excited about it. And so anyway, I'll show that because I just think that that's cool. I also humbled and honored, I guess, if anybody puts you with their family member of any type, I just think what a compliment. So, thanks. also you gave me again. And also D&D company, I want to give a thanks to you guys, but
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
because there's going through things I know but you didn't but you didn't give me any ideas you said you gave me ideas oh i think i think so fixated on this like getting the whole moving like can't talk about it because i'm like it's happening like it got dropped in my lap and then but it's like people around her acting very weird right just like okay i'm gonna make this happen moving a needle in right yeah not you guys okay no no yeah that whole thing is like now it's real becoming more real right and it's but also it's like none of us know what it's right it's like it's just conceptual it's like yeah so what happened yeah yeah but even in the beginning it's still surreal until holidays or something happens and
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs you and she can't immediately get to you. Although you've got way more resources so you can do that quickly. But, yeah, it's, uh, exactly. Thank you.
00:39:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I dand signed up for Southwest credit card that gets points.
00:39:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And gave Denise one and said, you can do this whenever you want them.
00:39:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Both, both you.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't like you, but they're going to know you're amazing.
00:39:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good job, dad. Good job.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anyway, if just a type of gift basket, something, if you have some ideas, I don't want to nag you about things or bug you, but you forget. So I'll just do texting and teaming until I get an answer. Okay. So Stacy said, um, I got more questions. But in terms of like, you said Bobby finished, she wasn't aware that he'd finish in about as I was wrong. Yeah.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Yep. Um, but it's getting worked on still.
00:40:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I didn't realize that he so him and I have had a conversation about, uh, we're using like reset you as the example. So I think we had this conversation on Thursday. So like they made another request for, I'll just say a funnel. And the problem is that this is so sad. Apparently nobody can scope this except for me. Because Abish, I could be Jay's version. was like, Oh, think that's right. Bobby's version. was like, eh, that's not right either. And then Dan's version was, can't we just do X, Y, Z? And then those guys are like, yeah, we could. I go, OK, well, then let's that's how this is done. But then it and also my part. the problems then. And then I pointed this out. In the future, this would be a template. This would be a cloud template. So let's keep that in mind. Right. So in the future, if someone didn't, basically what I was like, Hey, no, no, no, we can just copy this funnel kit funnel and swap out the product. Done. Now if they want this to then go into lead flow or whatever, like this funnel does, then we need to, you know, estimate those hours or how much I can be doing this with those hours, which they can easily do. And I was like, but if it was just in the future, it was like, Hey, they want sales page. Well, we're going to have like sales page, ABC. And then we might have funnel AV that we might have phone or we might have whatever, right? And but it would be a cloud template. And we would say, so it would be launch cloud template, create product if it doesn't exist, attach product done. So we figured that out and then that reduced the scope, essentially, then, mean, I have to check in VJ's rate for that is like 25 bucks.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Bobby's like, what, what, what do we raise it? I go, my answer was all I'm saying is it needs to be a minimal 40% and Bobby's like, I think we should triple their price. I go, is that a minimal 40% because I go, is that a minimal 40% because it's way more than that. go, great. How much does it come out to be? It's like, it's 150 bucks. I go, I go, I like that better because then that sort of bakes in them being able to raise their price and us not having to, right? So, but I go, I always want to have a 40% profit margin on whatever we're doing. That's my target, right? We're not going for an agency 15. We're going for 40. just that's it, right? And then, so now. from that perspective, I was like, we can go revisit the pricing of the service from that vantage point. How do we say, how do we figure out what is the 40%, so it's not 40% now, it's that we're getting maybe it's 60 now, and we know that, hey, we're going to have to, this is going to happen, right? We're going to have to upgrade the server with Presidion. Well, that's a humongous price height. It's quadruple, but we won't be using all the resources, right? We're just going to absorb that cost. So you go from 800 to 3000, and I got, we've been avoiding it for months and months and months. like, no, we're not switching, because I'm not, I'm not eating that cost right now. So it would be like, okay, we have to factor in that. And then we have to factor in the Abish again, DJ, like I would factor in the doubling, right? And then, so where, how do we figure out that pricing that GPT will be? So that's, that's the last conversation I haven't thought about it on, I think it's 3-0 Friday. Except what I just said, I never said.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it right there. don't know if I can have it, but I'll.
00:44:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. totally know what I just said.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I did make most of the notes in here. So if you wanted to look at that. Yeah.
00:44:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, because my other argument was like, we have to be comparative to a good job or whatever, but we don't have to. Pop their price.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can be higher than that. Well, yeah, because.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's more than that. That's, this is a managed service. Yeah.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is not managed. Right. Yeah. Yes, I'm just going to put this in here in your text or email or I'm just to send the link. I think that, I mean, it would be interesting to me to have a conversation with chat GPT about your scenarios where you can't get people on the same page with you about some of the text stuff and say, look, here's our scenario, here's the task, here's what these people said, this is their role, here's what this person said, so I'm checking BJ, this is what I said, this is what I suggested. I don't know if we could give it enough information to be able to help but. But anyway, the biggest thing is if you could come up with a, almost like a decision matrix for them to measure the logic and go, like, how did you come to that conclusion? What's the simplest way to do it, which maybe would be the decision point, right? little diamond, is it these options, whatever, which one is the simplest, whatever that type of thing?
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is that there is, like, we haven't defined, hey, these are the three landing pages, hey, these are the sales pages, right? They're defined only in design only, but they're not defined like, I mean, to be completely honest, they don't even exist in reality, right? They exist in that the blocks exist, so therefore you could make that layout, but we have never made the layout or used it, because the theme is irrelevant. So in the future, whatever sales page and checkout page reset you is using, I will get rid of it. It would be like, hey, put them on checkout page A or one or whatever the naming command becomes. And then there's no question, it's like, hey, they need a new funnel funnel one. Okay, great. knows what funnel is. funnel one is, what funnel one does, where funnel one lives. But right now there is no funnel one, right? Everything is, it's, there is no menu. The menu exists only in concept, but the menu does not exist in reality because the item on the menu also doesn't exist, but that should all be resolved come November, come October, asked Abishik for an update today, like, all right, Eric says we're on track with Frank. Are we on track with Frank? If we are on track, do you have an ETA for? the woofer site launch and he's asleep so I'll probably get that answer tomorrow. But I mean that's it, but that's literally D-Day. Or B-Day, basis day.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go B-Day.
00:48:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
D-Day's got the publications.
00:48:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send that to you soon because I wasn't paying attention because I was talking to you. I'm just going to add this part into which is that you haven't defined the pages or the layouts and that that will help with the logic and the pricing.
00:48:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the menu will be real, right? It'll be like it will be like you can have a picture, right? Here's what your burrito is going to look like.
00:48:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like a catalog with an actual image that you can have and here's the you know the item in the catalog.
00:48:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, and then we'll be able to and that it will be in use, right? Fulfer will be using what would be check out page one and then sales page layout like the sales page layout is, you know, the copy that Maria and I did and the design is done and if the copies all in it, like, but it's been built how you I'm going to I'm started meeting with her this week, every day. I'm again.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so.
00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Every day. Yeah.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all 15 minutes a day. So I can just get a I'm talking to somebody who cares about what I'm doing. And so I get a little like accountability and. On the bill of body. Yes. Um, I think, I think, um, the, there's equal benefit to both of us, but the power I know of what I'm giving her is different. She already feels different. She's excited. She's on fire. she's, she's like, I should be so tired today. ate gluten and I went to sleep late. whatever she's like, but I'm energized. I'm like, that's what clarity does, baby. But yeah, so I think that I think that will be really good for me. But like one of the things we did today was I asked her basically her business origin story and she's amazing. Like she's done crazy things and she's probably a genius. And just really, um, I don't think she's always played small, but, but she, uh, again, I don't think I'm, I don't, by the way, telling people to have to think.
00:50:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, her and I went deep.
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. So anyway, basically being married to a narcissist, rector, as it does to women, uh, get anybody. Yeah. But yeah. So anyway, I think that, um, she's just. and new seasons of life and everything else. But anyway, she's really, really smart. She just is not centered on anything. I'm trying to figure that out, but I think her heart is her center because she just loves business. both had paper routes and bought our first bikes with our paper route.
00:51:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, I didn't feel like you two have parallel vibes and almost parallel resumes. Because she was undercover behind the scenes on some largish stuff. But then ultimately, it didn't work out, right? Whether for whatever reasons, right? the business was F-ed up or the guy was F-ed up or whatever. And then she went sort of solo still undercover and she, like you, is very much resistant to it's bizarre. It's, I want to, but I don't want to do her own thing, right? So she's, so she's, she's putting her toe in and she's pulling her toe back out. And then she's like doing it. And, but it seems like it's inevitable.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, he doubts herself very much. Yeah, which is weird because it's not how you deal with the narcissist for so long.
00:52:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she's got the result. You do crap.
00:52:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Cause somebody literally tells you that every day. Yeah. She's got the results. So it's like, that's the part that matters. Yeah. She's got the, the, the speak, she knows the language.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She, she's very, she's data driven.
00:52:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Like, yeah, I mean, I'm dying to do something with her. just need a damn code.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We should do something with the three of us. You would balance us out. So good.
00:52:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. Yeah. want to do mom and family with her period. Like, I'm going to, yeah, that's what I want to do with. I told her about it. She's like, oh my god that sounds like that sounds so cool and i'm like i already know how to generate the leads already you're i'm going to put them into that thing that i sent you that's my plan i'm like okay i can put them into this i will i'll use high level for the whole thing i was generating leads for less than two bucks on this one lead magnet i think i might change the lead magnet marks working on it i talked to them about it this week i just need to sort of revisit that stuff and go i need the code and then it would be like all right cool get all the design stuff pulled together you know most of it is and just make sure it's all looks right built right and then i don't want to run ads oh so you did that for sure i know i don't want to run ads but i want to be involved in the ads right it's like okay and then obviously be able to have someone this that gets data right and then i can and i feel like i can get her data no one else ever does yeah here we go like And then, but she's, she's, you know, all her little case studies are very dated through them. Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she gets it.
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Funnels successes math, blah, blah.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're going like, yep. Yep. I'm like, that's, and I could keep her focused. So she doesn't sabotage and over stretch and do too many things. So there's any, any way to help there or just, I would just love to see her work with somebody.
00:54:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good. I mean, it's literally my plan. I'm just waiting for the damn code and it's probably not going to happen until I realize it's probably not going to happen until January, but whatever. That's fine. New year, 2025.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. She's awesome. I'm so excited to see what happens though when she, I don't know, I like liberating people and she is a person that was guarded and trapped. told her it's, it's, I saw the mask and I was like, I'm just going to tell you, I think you're guarded and you can't be like that with me. So I'm pushing and we'll see what happens, but she let me in.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yeah.
00:55:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
more smart women.
00:55:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm so excited.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wouldn't know about her without you either. So thank you, I had no idea.
00:55:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She was her. She, she.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep my interest. But you find her because you go down rabbit holes.
00:55:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Hopefully.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for being a rabbit hole follower.
00:55:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It was, she said something about writing coffee for women, I think. Or it was very into what I was doing with the chat GPT thing. The wolf or spreadsheet.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:55:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Which we ended up using.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hard. Superized guys, any movement in that conversation.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I never even wrote them back. just. don't see a path. And so I realized with you, right, where I was like, oh, we really need this. Right, right, right. I reached out to Hamza, wrote him a brief scope, saw that he read it on Upwork, hit him up again with my favorite, my favorite response. Yes, question mark, no question mark, maybe question mark. And he responded, and he was like, I would like to do this hourly because it's, you know, a bit of a moving target, whatever. And I said, that sounds great. Can you give me an estimate on the hours that would take you to create a beta that we only use internally? Does it mean a thing? I just need something that we can bang on. And he said, I will do that. And I will get back to you. think he said he would do it today. I am not really logged in off work yet today. So I'll check on that. He's 40 bucks an hour. He's as good as hired. Let's see. He comes back and says $400, which I seriously tell you So yeah, I think he's going to say, you know, 15, 20 hours, not even how do you know, we'll see.
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be way cheaper than they and some of you that supervise things that they're going to get. Yeah, but then you'll be a competitor, guess what?
00:57:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I'll be able to go back with them and say, hey, look, I just did this for $600, right? And the cost, I know the cost, I know I can figure out the cost for me to use their software and convert someone to an email. That's the only cost I care about, right? So for them to create a follower is 30 cents. I can do that with an ad. I can do it at a greater scale. So then the question is Can I turn the ads? What's the cost of turning an ad into a follower versus the super ice?
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be super duper close and The way I do that is with potentially $1,000 What I'm just taking $1,000 out $1,000 ad Yeah, was like we don't spend it Which could still be all power flowing You know what I just realized It took me that when you were talking about lead flow you're like I've never been able to visualize all that it is like for me It was a system that and it took me forever to get here figuring out that it was your automations in high level But to me, but now I it's your high level account period Right that you call lead flowing Yeah, that's my white they don't dance. Yeah, I do not realize that. This is the thing without seeing the stuff when we talk about it conceptually and not screen share, I'm like, it takes me so much longer to wrap my head around it. Yeah, which is probably a useful conversation in when you struggle with having any conversations with Abhishek and Vijay, maybe doing more screen sharing as they're talking about things, just clicking on it, looking at it so that they can make the visual correlation between what's happening in your mind.
00:59:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I don't know what I think the issue there is, you know, they were, they like, the information gets to them incorrectly. So basically, they based it off of literally what Ross wrote the ticket. But then they did another task that Frick rope, and I'm like, why is this a landing page? Like, is there a reason why you guys made this landing page that I'm not getting? Because it shouldn't be a landing page. And then, and then, so Eric screwed that up. And then I started to, I was like, oh, we should do XYZ. And then I sent that. And then the next day was like, wait a minute. I looked at the page, then even I got it. I looked at the page and I like, whoa. You know what, I didn't even talk to the SNO people. So, you know, when the information you're working off of is wrong, essentially, or, you know, sort of mis-scoped. But that version gets resolved by the menus. The one that I just brought up is just a one-off that, you know, we just, it just wasn't obvious looking at the design, what it was to any of us. Yeah. Then I went to Gert. And then even when Gert. Sabry wanted, I was like, how did he do that? This is custom. Okay, I know what it needs to be now. So they actually built it right. It's just now we have to decide it should not be on the page for a different reason, even though it works.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any updates on Mom? Just I got to get the book over to Katie.
01:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Katie was waiting to close on her house, which they did over the weekend and they're moved in. Just sent a photo with her large cheeked baby. The baby's got like jowls. like, oh my god. So much cheeks. So now that there she's like, you know what, we just got to get that out of the way. So I got to dig that up, send it over to her with my thoughts. What I was thinking as far as this metaphor of the organization and then her and Jeff was like, We'll do it, or, you know, that her husband's name or something? Yeah, he's also an editor. So between the two of them and me, we should be able to get it. then Mark's like, I don't give a what you do with that. It's a great, because that's pretty much my plan. Not giving a about what you think. Sorry, buddy. Good job writing it. And then that to me is like the Maria project. It's like a book funnel. Or that's one of them. So like I imagine you could have a book funnel and then you could have the freebie funnel, which would be the cheat sheet, right? Which is going to be a release cheat sheet kind of thing. That's the new one that Mark's working on now. Before we used a royalty cheat sheet that worked, but I'm not sure it attracted the right avatar. But then again, we also didn't have a funnel to drive them through, right? Like I was just proving. step one, can I get a lead? could now buy that stupid snapshot probably today and then get moving on that. Oh, I guess I need to make a mom account or I don't think I have one. Now I have to move the mom account like I told you now I'm just move it. gonna move it between agencies and then I'll make the team account. I do have a bunch of leads in there.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I now that the girls are back in school, I'm just like doing the best of doing things out and they're not around all the time. It's something about just hovering as a mom when the kids are home. I'm afraid to get into anything because I'm not even kidding you. The percentage is probably high 90s. Every time I sit down and I'm ready to be creative, the people I care about most want to talk. nobody wants to talk to me for hours then hours hours and so I'm just can't about it because they're not gonna be here forever so I just be like okay let it go and I feel like a slacker and I judge myself and I'm like I'm not but still like that's just my priority but anyway all right it's 110 10 and they're texting me and I probably should let you go yeah I'll give you one update this is gonna be great it's gonna be like the cliffhanger update and then we're gonna I'm gonna just hang up on you and there is informing Jamie today that she's out I need to save those notes so apparently there's a 60 day first write a refusal clause that she's gonna tell Jamie this exists FYI so you have 60 days and she's asking for 300 grand
01:05:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is not going to happen.
01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so then what does that mean?
01:05:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then she can go sell it without Jimmy's input at all.
01:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's rough. Yeah. I am happy for Heather. I can't not feel bad for Jamie. No, what she did in it, but I don't. Wish, you know, there's so many things that go into how she behaves. And not everything is her fault. But even when we do do things and it is our fault, you still kind of got to feel bad. Because somewhere something, something went wrong and it's just. I'm glad for Heather moving on and maybe it'll help Jamie. I we all have to learn lessons and usually the hard way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to learn everything the hard way pretty much. Yeah. mean. I talked to Heather and I said, just be prepared for like, no one's going to buy this. I hate to break it to you. And then so I'm like, you should have a, you know, owner financed thing on the table. She's like, I don't trust Jamie to do that. I go, no, I know you control all the finances. So the owner finance would be, I'm taking 80% of the revenue until this number is met. And then I'm releasing it all to you. Period. And she's like, oh, that could be a plan B.
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, girl, that's your plan A. hate to break it down.
01:06:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It looks like it's a plan B, but it's really, yeah, yeah. You might want to add a bubble to the bottom of that A because it's a B.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's man, business is like, parenthood too. Like you think it's going to be one thing and you build it to be one thing and it's never, but you think it's going to be no matter how hard you work it to be that way.
01:06:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, And I was like do it. Yes. was like just do it right now And then we had a call together this morning and Jamie was so awful on the call.
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like oh my god What's she?
01:07:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's that I was gonna ask what she did, but I'm not trying to be like oh it was just like she all out of nowhere Was saying well, I didn't get paid to do the gen pucks of videos last time and you know It's got a big deal, but this time I want to get paid and Heather's like you've never been paid to do those. Yes I have I think we're just both misremembering Heather's like no, Jamie Never happened. Yes. Well in December of 2022. So clearly she like Rose is narrowed over to her head I got a large check in December 2022 right before the gen tucks deal launched Heather said yeah That was a member distribution because we were flush with cash Nothing to do with generation that's not how I remember it and Heather's like yeah, but that's what it is. There's no record of you ever. So then Jamie there because Jen Tucks came back. And so first Jamie didn't want to do it because they have so many bad reviews. And it was like, you know, there's a moral aspect to this. And I was so ninja on the phone. And I was I can't wait. I was when I talked to Heather, like, you see what I did there? And by the end of the call, Jamie was like, Oh, yeah, let's do the videos. I'm like, you're so weird. And that but then I don't know where she brought up this thing where she should get paid as the talent to do the videos. And then Heather goes, I guess we'll just do the the version that doesn't happen. And then it was like, oops. And then I'm like, Oh, this is so over. That was after the show up on video. No, I don't know. I was on the phone.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They might have been I could just imagine the faces on one of the calls with the two of them when they were going through stuff. And that was when Heather first started standing up to Jamie after we'd had some talks and I was like this is really glad I wasn't on video because I have no hope for me at all. Okay. Anyway. That's a terrible way to end a meeting on whatever. Go pet my dog.
01:09:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go. Me too. Let me go eat some food too.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perky.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good.
01:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I am.
01:09:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
As matter of fact, exactly that.
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seven years.
01:09:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've learned a couple of things. Here we go. All right.

Hello, 18 a good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you? I'm doing good. How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, I'm glad to speak with you today. Um, have you had any kind of background about about what this conversation would be about or what to expect or anything?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.
00:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so last year, I met with Samantha and Lorenz, and we had one conversation, and we talked a little bit just about leadership, because it was more an exploratory call, like, happens if we talk to the attorneys, not the business owner that hired me. And Samantha wasn't interested. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. This process isn't for everybody, but Lorenz kind of around with it. And so we had a conversation that he was particularly interested in, and I'm telling you this because the approach is different for everyone. So what you're interested in and what might be beneficial to you may have nothing to do with anybody else, and I'm not interested in doing anything that's not helpful to you or not interesting to you. So keep that in mind. But what he was interested in is the fact, first of all, Samantha puts up big numbers and she beats everybody. She beats everybody in terms of attorney fees and how many cases she does. I don't know if you know that, but she does.
00:04:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I figured, I figured.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but her approach is different and her approach doesn't work for everybody. You know, there are different types of personalities inside of Sweet Law. There's been shifting around, you know, different case managers on different teams, different assistants on different teams, things like that. And a lot of that, Mark has driven based on conversations with different attorneys and just finding who works best with there.
00:04:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So that's one little type of tweet, right?
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But for Lorenz, he saw those numbers and he's like, I could do better. I want to do better, but I don't know how to do better. And so, after having a conversation with him, I figured out something that I thought would work for him and I give him a book called multiple. pliers. And that is how to make better leaders out of everybody around you. So instead of him, because he didn't feel like he was really bringing the best out of the people on his team, and also he didn't feel that that was his strength. So I gave him that book and he had a couple of aha moments, but fast forward three months later, and he almost was doubling his monthly numbers. So, you know, that that's that's some good results. And he was interested in this. So I don't know what might be good for you. I know you're fairly new. New to Sweet Law. Now, I don't know how new you are as an attorney.
00:05:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
know you're a younger one attorney. don't know if you practiced anywhere else before. No, I'm coming up on just putting my second year and know that.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did you become an attorney?
00:05:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
My uncle was an attorney and when I was a kid, my guy was just following his footsteps. I saw it was like a lucrative opportunity. I feel like the type of work is things that I'm able to tolerate more than most people would. So I do feel like it's something that because I know the average time for an attorney is like five years before they kind of make a decision on what they want to do. They want to go somewhere else, you know, but I'm cool like the work that I do coming in here talking to clients, getting like, you know, complained at why is the number this or, you know, just juggling things. I just feel like I have a good tolerance for that and I can just crank work out. Now, there's like two sides to being a lawyer, like some are in court all the time, some are, you know, doing what we do here where we're just office dealing with clients, which I feel like is better for for me, which is why I pick this area, but if I have friends that are attorneys, they're like, I can't do what you do. Like, it's just boring. But for me, I'm like, I don't want go on court once in my career. You know, so I don't know. I like what I do. And I just feel like I have what it takes to make a good living off of it. And it's cool. Like, we have this one case, the kid was like 22 years old, pretty big injuries. And the money that we got for him, he was able to pay off school that he's going to. things like that are cool to know that, like, you know, that took a chance in hiring us and we were able to change a portion of his life, which is pretty cool. On every case is like that, some clients always complain about the money that they get. But every now and then you. get something cool where you feel good about about what you do. So, that's good.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good insight that that helps me actually to learn a lot about you. So you would you consider yourself pretty easy going?
00:08:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my my requirements are like very low as long as I have a few hours to go to the gym during the day. That's all I really care about. Well, coming to work early, you would have to do pretty high patients level. did go to a military college, so things that would probably stress people out more or like start to freak out a little bit earlier. I typically have like a longer range of where I'm able to tolerate it before it gets to that point, which why I'm like just so chill at work because I've been through so much.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing.
00:09:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, this is nothing, you know, um, yeah, I'm a pretty talent person. Like, I don't, or how many needs, you know, but do you feel like do you feel driven or do you feel like I'm just like meandering kind of through life and it's just chill and is really big goals? just don't like I'm the type of person I'll just rather do the work than just, you know, talk talk about, you know, what my big plans are or like, I keep a lot of things to myself and like, yeah, you like blink in like two years later, it's like, whoa, how did Pat get there? It's like, you know, putting in the work like after high school, I went straight to college. After college, I went straight to law school like never really did you live in like, kind of a poverty or like gang area or anything when you were younger? No. And then I parents weren't like really well off, but We weren't like on food stamps or anything like that.
00:10:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not necessarily that you were poor, but that was it around you.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, not really.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. you just have a. You remind me of a lot of people that had like lived in tough neighborhoods coming up, you know, and so I was just wondering, I was curious about that. So I know that you hope you kind of keep things close to the chest, but would you share any of your professional goals with me?
00:10:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm two years in. Obviously, like the first day I got here, I saw that like Sam was the highest. So there's like a competitive nature, but so a lot of respect. Because when Mark hired me, I didn't really have any experience in this. field, first that I had when I first started now, obviously like I got more cases and have a team now, but like I always joke around with their teller like, because I don't have as many cases as she does, so obviously I can't really get the numbers there, but you know, obviously my goal is to be the one that does leading the firm as far as the numbers go, just from a competitive standpoint, obviously every month like things change, but I love that. Because I know I'm still pretty young, but, you know, some months I'd be Lauren's or I don't know if you've met Tyler before. And I have like half the cases that they do. So like, to me, that's like my way of showing that, you know, because I'm obviously they're older, they have more experience and education, but that's my way of trying to get respect that like, hey, I just got here and I'm, you know, starting to make my mark. So that's really important for me.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So do you keep track of stats like how long it takes your cases, what percentage of the time you're hitting a max settlement and what's the other one? Just how many cases you're taking? Like, I know that you're given cases. But what are you doing in terms of monitoring those numbers? and trying to push them, if anything.
00:13:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I have a list of cases that get settled every month, so I see a daily track of what the number is for that month for settlements and how much the attorneys fees we brought in. There's also like a little note on there if it's settled for the policy limits.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure if you know what that is. Yep, that's what I meant to say when I said how much, yeah.
00:13:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so obviously every case we pushed for that, but it doesn't always work out that way. Right. know Mark keeps a better track of how many policy limits cases we get. I don't know if so many cases were because I can keep a lot of things in my mind, like right now because I don't know as many, but I'm really on top of the numbers. Because that's obviously the indicator that, you know, Boss looks at to see where everybody's at you are you able to see that and let if I The list do you have access to you have access to let if I everybody does right?
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, okay, so we've been working on the dashboard for the last three years This has been a whole long process and and one of the things is just really trying to put together the numbers and a really clear way That are important that help us figure out. Okay. How are we performing? Across the board. How are we performing across attorneys and pods? How are we performing across? Types of cases how are we performing across? Vendors who bring us the leads because we have several different vendors that bring us leads They all perform differently how are we performing across states? So like we're really analyzing breaking everything down and You know how it is any anywhere you go you've got some people that come in to collect paychecks And we've got
00:15:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
uh people that come in because they got missions to accomplish and goals to accomplish and then we got people that are just in there trying to slam everybody like there's a whole spectrum right of how they show up and um so um you said that there was something that like sometimes that at night you'll think about like what you could do better what are some of the things that i've popped up in your head um just being more efficient on certain tasks because when i started it was just me with my case load and then in january i got a case manager and then like march i got an assistant um so i'm just doing every piece of the case myself um now obviously i have people who are being paid to help me um so it's more like let me focus on certain things that are gonna that i need To do, for example, negotiating or, you know, pushing certain cases out, monitoring, that's one of the things I did the last month is going through the case load early and figuring out why something is stuck, or how can I move it forward? Because the more cases you get, some things start to slip and get stuck. Mark does a good job of going through our cases, too, reminding us like, hey, you know, this one can be moved and get done this month. So just kind of trusting another person to do their job, see like things that kind of slip. Because when I first cut a team, I was like, well, this is great. Just let them know what they're supposed to do right. I'm like, okay, you guys go do that. I'll go do this. And then I started looking through the cases and like certain things are being missed. So I know that I can just give these people 100%.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I love that you've noticed that. And so you have Cynthia, right?
00:17:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And she used to be on the rental team. Yeah.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like, one of the things that he learned about her is that she is very systems and processes oriented, like she needs to have structure. Whereas he said a lot of other people that he's worked with, they don't, they're just like, you know, they roll with whatever. But she likes to have the documented, she likes to be like step by step. Do you feel like you've noticed that also or noticed anything about how she works?
00:17:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she is like that. But now she's a little bit because for like a good three months, it was just her and I. So, and I didn't know I was going to get other help. So I kind of trained her to, you know, be proactive and not necessarily have to wait for me to task her for every little thing and be like, look, when we get this case, these are the three things that always need to get done. You know, after a month or two, distance to get done. So now she's a little bit more, she's still like very task oriented, but she's still now, she's little bit more proactive where she knows certain things have to get done, no matter what, so.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you consider yourself a leader?
00:18:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm still figuring that out because I'm a really independent person. And like if I was able to, I would just handle all my cases by myself.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you do with is being a leader. What's that? What you do with Cynthia is being a leader.
00:18:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's still hard for me because like, like I work out a lot and I never have a gym partner.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always go by myself.
00:18:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. But she's been, yeah, I mean, I know what I have to do in order to get the team to, like I can be a leader, still figuring it out because like I said, a lot of things in life I would rather just do by myself, but. Obviously, can't 200 cases, when I need to, in college, we had a lot of leadership stuff. We're at like lead teams and trained people. I'm just trying to find how to do it, because obviously here it's like, if you don't perform, then your job is on the line. So I need to manage how I lead them, because eventually it's on me, right, if the team makes a mistake. So I need to kind of control and not be too harsh on them to the point where they're like, you know what, just go work somewhere else. So it's like a balance between, okay, we need to like fix this, but not talk to the team in a way to where it kind of ruins the dynamic because, you know, conversation, and they'll always remember that. Um, so that's kind of how many jobs have you had in your life?
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Real jobs or any job. Like I had a newspaper route when I was 11, I worked in the fields and dug two lip bowls out of the ground and my fingers were bleeding by the time I was like 10 o'clock and I was 11 years old.
00:20:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I was weird, but I worked, I cut grass, I babysat, I did like all of those jobs.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they all shape us. So tell me about your work history.
00:20:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I used to work at a grocery store before law school. And this is my second job.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So how are you? How much time did you spend there?
00:20:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Three months?
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three months? Yeah. So what did you do?
00:20:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like did you play sports? Yeah, I played water polo and swam in high school.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was a different. Swimmers are different I'm trying to I'm trying to profile you.
00:21:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, the biggest thing is like the gym like that's like my my baby so That taught me a lot of lessons.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um Do you compete?
00:21:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't but People would think I would the way I treat it, you know Are you an only child? No, I have an older brother How much older two years?
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're the baby Okay, yeah, just taking so do you feel like you've had much for opposition and life?
00:21:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um Probably not But those are a lot of times those were because of the things that I did like Like I worked my up in school to Fast the bar on the first try for example I could have been an opposition if I failed and I got away another year to take it and things like that So I feel like I do the right things to minimize the amount of like hurdles because I don't like when things get postponed or I Don't know I'm just very that's why you don't like working with other people because most people don't show up like that, right? Um, I mean the team's been really good so far.
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't really know. Let's just talk about the team I just talk about you in general like all the way up through life because you do a lot of stuff by your own So it's definitely not just about your team and and treat law Why does it do you feel like like all you do you feel like you're I don't think you're an extrovert? But are you extroverted introverted or ambivert meaning a blend of both?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
But it just depends what I'm doing like I Work I'm pretty pretty introverted and just come in do my thing and go home but then at the gym I'm looking
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
totally different person like. Yeah.
00:23:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You know, or if like, there's something that I want to fix in my life, then I'm extra vertical because I'm like, I got to get this done or do you have to be around people all the time like to feel and there's okay, so you're an amber bird. I can literally work in a square box and not see a single person for a year and be okay. But I can also come here and like chitchat and have lunch with people like, you know, yeah, it's kind of weird. Like I can really do both.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's that's good. You actually you have a lot of qualities I am very familiar with and they're all amazing. So I don't know that you know that about yourself yet, but you have the potential to do some really amazing things. And the great thing is you should try to stay humble, which I think you actively work on constantly. I think you're probably conscious of that. But there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. But the power of confidence is that you get some things done faster, but also it has energy and it's palpable and it moves people around you. And I think that you have it, but you may be resisting it in the vein of wanting to not be arrogant. Hold on, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm we'll keep our eyes up. I will finish my call and then no, not here and there. You know what, go ahead. She can come. Come on, you're filthy. All right, thank you. you okay now? Okay, so we had a massive flood in our yard. We had an above ground pool that just exploded in the morning and it sounded like worse than any tornado or anything I've ever heard. And so my daughter was out there and she she's 17 and she's going to clean it up and apparently it cleared a little hole in the corner of the fence where her dog could get out and she was terrified that she'd lose her baby and so she was like freaked out and I'm like okay anyway you never know what you're going to get no I've got four daughters and they're all super strong well they're two of them are grown 117, 114 and I have a granddaughter and It's the most wonderful, amazing thing in the world, and it is also the hardest I can imagine in the world. My mom used to always say, I hope you go and just like you. And I was like, well, I got four, so... Perhaps you four is something else. Yeah, and by myself, that's been something else. But like I said, it birthed. It birthed this, and I love what I do because I get to meet amazing people, and they're all leaders, and they're all brilliant, and yeah, yeah, pretty magical. I love what I do. So anyway, back to you, Pat. You prefer Pat. Yeah, not Patrick. I think they're way worse. In the way. Well, okay, so let me look at this time. just kind of think about this. So I don't know. this is... We didn't have a contract. Mark and I did make a contract for how long we'd work. with you, but he's paid for the quarter. So what I would love to do is just, so in the beginning with anyone, and then normally they're seeking me out, not this is somebody else's person that I work with. I do work with teams, but it's not the predominant thing that I do in way that I go about it. But since the quarter is paid for, the schedule that I suggested to Mark was I meet with you, once by yourself, you and Lorenz twice, although we may switch that up and just be do more one-on-one stuff because you will have very different goals. The benefit of meeting together is that it helps uncover some of the commonalities, some of the issues that might be not necessary issues, but what are the processes, what are the levers inside the business that we can do to improve? So like intake, for example, does not have a script that people follow consistently. And because of that, calls are handled differently. And we have figured out some better ways to handle calls, but because there's no script and the process, it kind of depends on whatever mood people are in, kind of mood the calls are in, and that's not the optimal way to run business. So, Mark's competitive too. Mark wants to see Sweet Lock Row, wants to get more cases, everybody wants to make more money, but not burning people out while doing it because life, you get one life, like business is not the thing. Life is the thing. So, figuring out how we can do all the things better and more powerfully in a more leveraged way so that, like I said, I love more from less. So, What I think, I would love to be able to spend time talking to you about just things like Cynthia, we talked about her a little bit. don't know anything about Elsie because she's newer also. And kind of figuring out how you guys work like what are some of the things that you come across. It's really a lot of just, it seems like we're just talking. It's very, it may even seem unstructured. promise you, it's not unstructured. I have been doing this actually for 22 years. So I've learned that there are certain types of conversations and it's primarily PAP. It's primarily probing. So I will ask a lot of questions and sometimes what you'll find out is that the questions made you think something you weren't thinking before. They make you ask your own questions or ask a question you haven't. Ask yourself before and by coming up with that answer, you're just like, Oh, well, I didn't think about that before. So now maybe I could try this. Maybe I could try that. The other benefit because we're doing this kind of as a group inside a sweet law is that as I'm talking to you and looking at things like go to Mark and be like, Hey, you know, Pat was having this experience. I didn't know about this. Can we try this? Can we try that? know, and I see that, but Mark, and I imagine you've figured this out, but Mark loves people. He loves his people. I don't know how he shows up in the office, but the way that he talks about people is, you know, this is like this is kind of his surrogate family. He, he cares like he's not, he cares about to take, like you talked about how you talk to people. He cares about that too. Although I think he's better at it now since talking. Can you me? I'm just going to take a little credit there. Just, you know, just work is work. We're all people trying to be the best people that we can be. And we do better when we can work with people who have some different experience, like you talking to Samantha. That's great that she's supportive and that she answers questions like that. And I think I remember Mark talking about you doing that from the very beginning, just asking lots of questions. Like that's actually also a great sign of a leader there. It might not seem like it because they're going to somebody else, but it is. So goals, that's what we were talking about. Okay, you want to compete with Samantha. Yeah, I like get some of the best case, not necessarily with her specifically, but as far as Sweet Lodge, just be one of the best attorneys. there, put up those big numbers, but also you care about the clients that come in, you want to take care of them. You've got these broad chill shoulders that can take some stress that other people can't take. You've noticed that you've got to be accountable for the work that happens on your team and so that you can't just leave them unchecked to work fully autonomously, but you did try to give them autonomy and but with direction and leadership. All of that is really, really impressive actually. There have to have to be diplomatic and when I say sometimes, so hold on a second. I won't say who and where but in some places, some people just don't care that even in tweet law, there's there's somebody that just those up for paycheck. That affects everybody, because they don't hold the same weight. And that could be in any department. I'm not naming names or anything. But my point is that even just one person like that impacts the energy of the firm, impacts the trajectory of the firm, and it takes a really long time to hire anybody. In the three years I've been working with Mark, I think we've hired maybe three attorneys, and he constantly has ads out looking to hire people. It's just really difficult to find good people in a good match. Not everybody wants to do pre-lit, right? know that. There's a lot of different things that people are looking for. when he's got somebody, he wants to take a care of them, train them, and make the most out of it for sweet love, but also for that person. And me, especially, I'm just mom wherever I go, which is not a professional way to really look at it, but it just is what it is. I was, I was born a mom, I was as a kid taking care of everybody and like, can I feed you? can I do for you? Um, so, so that's it. And I feel like you've got some mad potential actually, and it's really exciting because I've been watching sweet love grow. You know, I've, I've heard, um, some that Cynthia's had some struggles and to know that there might be, but also that she's great, that she's nice, you know, that she's a good person. So if there's somebody that can help her grow and, and be better and be able to be even more valuable, then that's amazing. And that makes you even a greater asset. So I would love to talk to you about just leaders. ship and optimization. different ways that like you've noticed, there are some things that have to be done. Like, so one of the things that I know sometimes calls just don't get followed up with consistently enough and the ball gets dropped there. And you know, if the cases age out too long, sometimes we've missed things. We're not we're not getting those. For the life of me, I can't tell you how many times I forget that word. And I know it. Yeah, no, when we don't when we don't get the backs. It's the benefits, but it's that's not the word. Yes, thank you. I swear there are some words in my brain that just are never want to come. Oh my gosh, and the most random ones and inappropriate ones. Sometimes we'll come and have the right ones. Anyway, policy lemons. Okay. Well, let me turn it back. Yeah, so not following up with things consistently and also like, again, on the intake side, not asking some of the right questions and then we find out that they've already talked to another firm or that they haven't gotten to a doctor and the case is too old, know, like there's all these different things that impact the likelihood of being able to do well and get our money because at the end of day, it's also a business like we're here to help people, but we got to help the team first by making sure we can stay in business and do good. So all of that. But I think that you and I talking together. Now, it's not a, wow, amazing. I can't believe this thing happened. You know, we don't have conversations like that. What happens is it's like working out like if you lift and you follow a regimen for years, sometimes some of them like you can, you can beef up fast. but some of them are like you just look six months later and you're like dang like I'm a little more cut and or I can I'm not tired anymore or these joints don't hurt anymore or like this this you're so young you probably don't know these things but yeah I'm injury free thing going you don't you don't know I'm 40 so I'm about to be 48 so like I know about these things I'm sorry um weightlifting is life for me I don't go a lot but it literally but I go consistently all the time and it's it's life like I'll never quit I'll be a hundred in a gym I don't care I'm like I'm not gonna have all that old dick crub and stuff happening anyway so um but I think that if we focused just on because I think that you're already you may not do you feel like you were interested in leadership like consciously
00:38:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like naturally I'm just like better off as like the grunt like just have me do work and I'll crank it out. So not naturally like seeking out leadership roles, but I feel like here everybody has their own little team and it's cool that way because I get to manage it and it's not like I know a lot of firms. It's like case managers just bounce around like whoever needs to grab want to do this, but for me or here it's like your team is your team like they don't just go work for somebody else for a week and come back. So it's cool because I can obviously I need the help right so I'm going to do what I need to do to make sure that everyone here is like working good and they're happy and so it's cool in that regard to know like when we have like a really big mantra. whatever that, you know, the team did it. at the end of the day, if I'm managing them well, then those numbers mean that, you know, as a leader, you did the right thing. Which is cool because if I go out and go do something by myself, that's great. But if I was able to do it while managing four different people, obviously that takes a lot more work. So the reward is like, wow, he did this and was able to manage all these people. And it's like more responsibility. But it's cooler when, because I know like if I'm just by myself, I know what I can do, but I've never had to really manage people. So that's like the new test for me. Which is cool like when it works out. But you like it? Yeah. Now, if I have like five people then, I don't know. But before we got into the group and we're doing good. So I'm gonna have the smallest team because I don't know. The biggest case load, but like months where we beat the other teams is like cool, you know, because it's like the three of us or when it was just me and Cynthia's like the two of us were able to beat the team of five, you know, yeah, but things like that keep me competitive. Like, you know, the mitigation guy, but he only has like Nick, really love. Yeah, really a lot of cases and he was beating me for the attorney's fees this month, like Mark sent it like a couple days ago and like that pissed me off. I was like, what's Obviously, if you get like a big case, big numbers, but And that's the ones that go to litigation anyway, so Yeah, they're kind of predestined to be higher numbers anyway. Yeah, but still.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll just tell you one thing, though, is Don't compete with people playing a game you don't want to play. You don't want to play a little game. You don't want to play litigation, so like, don't compete with people playing a game. You don't want to play. don't want to do that. It just, it gets in your head. You know what I mean? Gun from the people playing the same game as you. Because you just get tripped up. You take your eye off the ball and that becomes a problem. It creates this internal dissatisfaction that can't be corrected because you're not playing the same game. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:41:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I get that, but you're not playing the same game at all. You know that, right?
00:41:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, if Mark sees it that way, then I'm cool with it. But as far as I know, could ask him, you can ask him.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's the numbers and it was last and that's all he was saying. litigation and everybody else is 100% completely different. And I know because I've been talking to him for three years. And we look at the numbers and we don't even talk about Nick and the litigation team. It pretty much is isolated and honestly That's my bad. We probably should talk about it more, but that's it's not because what what really? Mark see sweet lot as a pre-vit firm period and the story litigation is only there to serve a necessary You know thing. It's a need we have to have an outlet for it. There's money on the table We're gonna take it, but Nick is playing a different game that Mark's not even really interested in playing It's just part of it. You know, you know I'm saying. So I You know you could talk to him ask him out right because Mark I think is pretty open about stuff too And if he tries to evade the answer cuz he does do that sometimes pin him down and be like wait look I like for real tell me Um, you said we're not planning to say gay That way like put it on me. I don't care. I'll be scapegoated all day long. I'm built for it. So Yeah, so the question really was like, do you see yourself as a leader and what I see is that you're still evolving and defining how you see yourself. You really just getting started in the professional world. And, but I would tell you, Pat, 100% you've got innate natural leadership qualities. And you may not be seeking them out. That's, that doesn't mean that that's not what you are. A lot of leaders don't. There's different types and, and it has a lot to do with the extroverted introverted type of thing, right. But some of the best leaders in the world were there because everybody else said, look, we need that guy because first of all his ego is not going to trip us all up and get us in trouble. It's not going to send us to war like Mr. somebody with their orange hair, but you know diplomacy whatsoever. You know what I'm saying, like, so. So, there's different types of leadership, here's where it's just natural for you. see a problem, and you say, like, you see yourself as, I just the grunt, and I just want to knock it out, but that's leadership stuff. I see that there's work that has to be done. I'm going to do it. That's a leader. You know, even if you're only one person, you're a leader of one, I know you've seen enough people in life to know that there are people who won't even steward themselves and manage themselves, right?
00:44:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, percent.
00:44:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. and there's a lot of those, right? Yeah. So, you not only will take care of yourself, but you see that, okay, I've got this thing that I'm a steward over now, this little pod, this little group, and I was trying to give everybody space to let them do their own thing, because I like to do my own thing, but then I realized they're not doing it well, so I'm going to help them. I'm not going to browbeat them, and I'm not going to hurt their feelings. I'm just going to show them how they can be better so that we can be better. Dude, that's leaders all day long. That's like good leadership all day long. So I would like you to just kind of ponder on that. It doesn't mean you need to go seek out leadership opportunities. It doesn't mean that you need to see yourself any kind of different. But knowing that first of all, it helps the people that you do have stewardship over it. Like I said, there's an energy to it where, and I would bet you anything Cynthia already feels this and else you do. It's Elsie, not Elise, right? Yeah, Elsie. They just are like, Pat is doing his job. Pat is watching out for us. Pat is going to help. Because you have that calm energy, but it's also strong and it's also smart. And people, especially women. in work and probably in lots of places are going to feel safe there, but when you're also giving them the skills and empowering them, you're going to find out I'm telling you this because it'll be important. There's going to be a lot of ways that you can compete and you can win because you'll be able to activate people that other people won't be activated because they'll want to work for you. They'll want to do their best for you because they don't feel afraid and they know that they're supported.
00:46:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I could tell you I might be wrong, but I'm almost never wrong about this stuff and I only say almost just to be humble, but I'm never wrong about this stuff. So watch, but people will want to work with you throughout your life. know you don't know where you're going to be, how long you're going to be there, I really want you to hear this and take this with you because you'll see it showing up in your life that you can get a lot out of people because they feel safe with you and because they know you'll do the work. That's another thing like a lot of people are told what to do by people who have no food because they're not doing it. They've had terrible leaders, terrible bosses. When they get somebody who's in the trenches with them doing the work, who knows what they have to do and appreciate it, they'll show up at a whole new level. So talking about leadership, there are two books. you like reading and all or listening to audiobooks?
00:47:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't want to have you do things. I'm never really trying to read at least when I can.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you like podcasts?
00:47:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's more tolerable, yeah. I think I've read maybe one full book in my life. Like as a kid, would be reading and I would just like read the same line over and over my mind would just be somewhere else.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you didn't lost.
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I would like to go reading.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ADD?
00:48:17 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't sitting there flipping through pages.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you don't listen to them either though. So it, um, do you, like, do you watch a lot of movies? Or you just like hit the gym a lot like, uh, I watch movies.
00:48:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was the same movie like over at all. I for sure don't have ADD. I just don't like, I just don't like to read.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, now this is me asking because like I said, I'm trying to profile and understand because if I try to get you to do stuff that you don't like and don't want to do, then that's just not going to be good. So what I can do is just kind of distill some of those things that I think would be useful for you. Some people like to and they get a lot out of it. So my approach with you would be, let me go refresh my memory on some of the books and talk to you about a couple of things. But the principles of, so there were two books I would have recommended. One is called multipliers and one is called essentialism. And the thing about multipliers is just kind of basically something I think that you do innately and that is look for people's strengths and abilities and just help them tap into it, support what they have to do, and then give them the freedom to do it and what you described was doing that with Cynthia. So it would basically be the purpose of reading it would be to see maybe the other applications and also so that you had a greater awareness of the power of what you're doing, but it's not, it's not necessary to read it. And then essentialism is just, there's a lot that gets done, and this would be towards the processes and figuring out, you know, where is there anything that's happening that's being done that doesn't really need to be done, are things being prioritized so that the most important thing is getting done day-to-day to push a case to where it needs to go, right? Every day, there's lots of phone calls that have to be made, right? There's lots of contacts, there's lots of information that has to be gathered, whatnot. So making sure that the most important things get done first, that drive the needle forward, sometimes that's not what people do, sometimes they just take the low-hanging fruit, like this is the call that's in front of me right now, this is the case that's in front of me right now. instead of maybe triaging according to their value, their likelihood of getting close, how good at communicating the client is and you know there's all kinds of different ways to kind of evaluate what's the thing that should be done first at the beginning of the day and throughout the day and so on. So but if we have some conversations about that at minimum for the next three months because that's what's being taken care of and if we talk about you know what your goals are what I'll do is go and solidify to and make sure that I've got some numbers for you to take a look at and compare it to what you're looking at already and see if I've got any more information than you see how I can help you be like okay this is your trajectory this is what you're doing um across the board in terms of so there's attorney fees which is our really the staple number that we're looking at. But there's also how many cases, there's also how many cases get closed, like the pace that they're getting closed. And obviously, you guys can't control when it's resolved and you get paid out, but we can't how long it takes to get closed. So just looking at those numbers and giving you kind of one-on-one insight into that and a little bit of a different perspective, then let's say Mark would have, I think that it could be something that would be valuable for you.
00:52:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Are you interested in that at all? Yeah, because I mean, the numbers and stuff is like just puts it right there and you can see everything. So I like the numbers because it's just easier and I understand like what's lagging or what's doing good. Yeah. And it's like a motivator, like when I see the numbers, like, I like the numbers.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to, the only reason I'm not going to do it right now is because I have to ask Mark, you know, I'm able to share and look at, um, just got a new, uh, report also, which is the best one that we've had so far. So let me look at it. When did you start again?
00:53:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
November 1st, 2022.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy cow, it's been not long already. Geez.
00:53:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Well, the first year was just like a blur.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we'll, I don't want to do last year. do equals this year. That was free by team. Yeah. For the year, I still don't know what I'm allowed to say. So I absolutely. Okay, that cannot be right. That one has to be wrong. That's the other thing. As our report is, it's in progress. And so we got to validate it, make sure that it's pulling the correct data. Because like it's saying, Nick's team for the year is averaging 1.8,000. And we know that that's not right. For an average of chummy fee. So I will, it's definitely wrong. But you're up there for sure. are in the game. And for being so new, I think that's something. Let me look at cases closed. For the year. That's interesting. Yeah, I just want to make sure these thumbs right. So I'm going to see what I'm allowed. to share and I'll check with Mark because I think that what drives you I think seeing these numbers would be huge for you and I think watching the numbers change would be huge for you and then some of the other things I'd like to do is talk about L.C. and talk about Cynthia you know how they're doing any patterns you might be noticing good or bad like I definitely want to know about good and in terms of the bad like we're not here looking for how to fire people how to get rid of anybody anything like that we're 100 percent here for how do we make everybody better and feel safer enjoy what they're doing more sort of the clients better and just just improve everything so I think it's really important to because sometimes people come in whatever and their agenda is how do we weed things out that's not what we're here for at all. Yeah, so that's what I'd like to do is just have some conversations. And the other thing though, Patrick, is like I was saying is that what happens is I'll ask questions and they kind of reveal other questions and lead to the next questions. So what I would be interested to know is if you, I would love for you to just take a little time and think about the conversation we've had today and see if any thoughts just kind of pop up that maybe hadn't before or they had that maybe you hadn't done anything with them. And if you're willing to, like, I would imagine you're not really a journaler.
00:56:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you want me to like think of a set of questions?
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, just kind of like, if you have a thought that you notice that was a result of this conversation, um, read it down and it doesn't have to be super in debt. That can be a bullet point, but it has to be written enough so that when we talk again, you'll remember and be like, wait, what was that about? Because I'm terrible. I'll write something down and be like, I can't even remember what I was thinking when I wrote down. So I just needed to be thorough enough that you could come back and go, yeah, I was thinking about this. Or like, if you're working and you're watching things going, you know what, I noticed this and I hadn't really noticed this before, because that's kind of all part of the evolution. But what that will also help me to do is know how your brain works, how what you're what you're kind of patterned are, because again, this is to be customized around you, like imagine, I don't know if you're like a Marvel dude at all. Which one? Marvel? Nope.
00:57:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
There's like a million characters.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Well, if I say Marvel, most people might say, are you a Marvel person? They're like, yeah, yeah, but like, just anyway, imagine you're Tony Stark, and we're building an Ironman suit, but it's just for you. Like his suit was built. for his strengths and for his weaknesses and for his mission, like what he was trying to accomplish. He kept trying. He kept iterating his suits, right? He had new versions because he's like, well, this one didn't do this. So I needed to do that. So my process is basically trying to build your perfect Iron Man suit. Like you're already great. Tony Stark was already brilliant and amazing, right? He was pretty powerful just as it was. But with the suit, you know, that was like multiplied many times over. So the goal here is to be like, what's amazing about Pat? How do we amplify that? And so it comes through probing, learning experiences. So everything that you think about and everything that you just kind of notice and observe, bring that back to the drawing board with me and go, okay, I can work with that. Let's do this. Let's try this. type of thing. How's that sound?
00:58:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I'm really open. I won't shy away from any questions. You have so pretty, like if you're asking something, I'll just tell you what it is.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, my goal is to help you hit your goals. Yeah, it does, it does, it does. But the energy with it, like I want you to come with your competitive side. want you to come thinking, all right, we are gonna figure out how I smoke these balls. I'm like, we're gonna figure out how I beat this list is like we get, we get all the cases and we get the best attorney fees and everything else. Like, that's the goal. But while also being a good guy that doesn't hurt people, that's not like plowing through people just to get to where he's gonna go, that you're doing that, that your team's winning, that they're getting higher bonuses, know what I mean? That incentive program is good, you know, and there's a way to help everybody. Like you could be the guy that helps everybody get paid more. And I think that'd be awesome. So. So I want you to think about that like, okay, I've got kind of this silent partner over here is going to help me win even more, but it's not just you winning. It's your whole team winning and it's all a sweet while winning. So, you know, think about it like that. then read anything down that you have. And we'll figure out, we got to figure out a time next week. You already told me what can work for you. I'll see. I have not heard back from Miranda. So let me check with Mark. See if we can get something on the books for next week for two of us. And then, you know, it's really fluid in the beginning. It's kind of awkward in the beginning, but it gets some legs on it and we'll get we'll get a flow. All right.
01:00:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So next week is not scheduled yet.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I, it's supposed to be you, me and Lorenz. I haven't heard from him yet. So. Will yeah, I'll follow up with you on that.
01:01:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's okay. Yeah, I mean, any time works for me like Monday mornings. It's just like Class of a waiting all weekend to call and select a little bit push, but Afternoons are probably best Okay, we can do that.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told me like any day after like at three or later one or or three any day at three I think you said Yeah, I prefer not to be that late I like to be done with calls by like two o'clock, but Monday's different because I started 10 and then I've got back-to-back calls until 130 so like two or three on a Monday would be perfect three o'clock on a Monday is perfect Because I keep a lot of the other days up and just for the actual work and not the beatings But I do need to get with Lorenz, but for you and I we can make it Mondays at three When so the one one once a month that it's just you and me so far we can do that so like a month from now same time we can get that on the calendar and then if you have any questions if you have any thoughts and be like you just want to shoot it out before you're thinking about it I would love it in real time rather than waiting until we talk again because then my brain gets to start working on it because I keep a small roster and I'm thinking about everybody all the time it's just the way that I work like this is my little team and I'm thinking about like wonder how Pat's doing like checking his numbers like how's things going and so if any thoughts come up I would just love it if you just shoot an email and be like hey I was thinking this okay I can do any questions um no I'm actually excited for this people about my thoughts and stuff so this is
01:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
different, you know, but I'm open to it, you know, Mark mentioned to me that obviously there's a value there, so I'm always open to trying because I trust him and um what he thinks is worth it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good to know. I'm really glad you shared that with me because like you're little stoic over there and just trying to read you and not give enough a lot with that poker face.
01:03:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This isn't me though, like so maybe I'll, I don't know if I'll open up, we'll see. It's kind of natural, it just happens. Yeah, it does. But good thing is I listen to everything you say, so don't think like this guy's bored out of his mind, it's just like, I'd rather just like when it's time to listen, I'll listen when it's time to talk, I'll talk to the thing. So don't be put off by it, a lot of people are like, well it's better than showing the emotions, like I listen to everything he's saying, you know, so.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will learn that too in, in the way that you should. and the conversation. thank you. That was really helpful to me. So now I'm really, I was already looking forward to it. I think you're going to do amazing, but I want to serve you well. Like I, you know, that's what makes me happy. So I'm looking forward to it. I've got somebody knocking at my door. I know my daughter needs me. So I'm going to go and I will follow up with the pool. I know. Thank you, Pat.
01:04:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I hope you have an amazing day. You

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

## Quote 10

Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll keep following up with you then. And everybody go, have a good day and talk to you next week.
01:06:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, bye-bye. Bye.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, wait, wait. What?
01:06:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I sent the turn, the new turn down reasons to you and Patsy and then she never responded because she left him returning leave. He left. just put those in place.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Danny.

Hi. Can't hear you. You're muted. Yeah. are you? Good. Good. Just sweetest got home.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Long day.
00:00:17 - Chona Sweet
It's okay. But yeah.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how has this been gone so far?
00:00:24 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it's getting a little better. I still feel sometimes I. Overwhelmed, but. And I. To be honest, I have a lot of charting.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you just have a lot of calls or because you're behind and not doing it.
00:00:46 - Chona Sweet
Behind and doing it.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why is that? How much, how far behind are you, do you think? these wise.
00:01:03 - Chona Sweet
I have I'm looking at it right now. have 80 notes.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not including, huh? Go ahead.
00:01:12 - Chona Sweet
Not including maybe I have to say not including today. Like maybe close to 99 total. No. Yeah, 99 total. And the hospital. I just got home.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I haven't charted the hospital. When did you get started?
00:01:46 - Chona Sweet
hospital. was unable to do. I was able to chart every day. Like that one. I was able to do that every time. was And the lean patient that comes from me, I mean from my sources, from me, I was able to do that.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when you say you were able to, does that mean you're not able to when you work at the clinic?
00:02:20 - Chona Sweet
I guess what I want to say is I feel more motivated to finish the charting on the hospitals and ones that I really don't like, there's a lot of work on the heart charting in the hospitals. I mean, I'm sorry on the clinic and I don't, I don't really want to do it. That's really what it is. I really don't, I was able to do what I need to do in terms of, in terms of, like I prescribed their medications, but I wasn't able to to finish the note. But I feel like the main job that I need to do, I was able to do that, I guess that that makes sense. But the note I know is part of it, but I just been I've just been not doing, not keeping up maybe that's the time. The telemedicine is easy notes. Yesterday's telemedicine, I did it exactly at the same time as I was doing it. Today, I sleep in, so I was only able to call all my telemedicine, but I haven't started the note. I plan to do it tonight after dinner.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what time did you get started working today?
00:03:53 - Chona Sweet
I started working at 1.30 today.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What happened to the conversation? Last week about wanting to make a million dollars a year and the only way you're going to get started in morning.
00:04:06 - Chona Sweet
I started the morning yesterday.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What time?
00:04:10 - Chona Sweet
Um, I started at 10. Well, no, I started working the moment I woke up I mean, yes, wait, what is today?
00:04:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Today's Thursday.
00:04:19 - Chona Sweet
Um, you see, when I woke up, usually would call my telemedicine and then I would go to the hospital. Today, that's not, I just sleep in. I just feel tired.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I gave in and. You feel like you're burnt out?
00:04:39 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, is, is the clinic something that has to be done? Like is in order for you to have this arrangement with Dr. E towards building the.
00:04:54 - Chona Sweet
I think it's my help right now because of the rolling in of. the patients, the thousands that are coming in, and apparently we're just gracing that just the top and, you know, all of us are, you know, the other end piece we would talk to each other to just say hi and they said that they're also feeling overwhelmed because everyone has new patients and they double book because some patients don't show up, some show, you know, so it's like, for example, on Tuesday I have a schedule of 13, I think, in the afternoon, or I forgot 20, and then only more than half was seen, but because it's new, it's just a lot. So that's what I've been doing now so that it will be easier for me to chart later on is I Started pre charting, but correctly while I'm with the patient So, you know, that's that's what I've been doing versus a chicken scratch of Pain in low back like this and that you know, just one word two words. I don't do that now Oh, I you tell me you started that like a week or two ago though but No, I well I started probably a week ago, I feel like I I'm not consistent in terms of Doing that, but because if I feel like I'm already I feel I'm feeling overwhelmed and then I just start doing the words But now I've been like really doing it every patient that was that way when I taught it's faster when I finish it It's faster when you say now you're doing it consistently as of what day did you start doing it consistently oh I guess yet last week Monday true because I only have clinic Monday Tuesday And then the rest is sporadic Depending if I have lean patients Your charts how far are the oldest one go back One and a half weeks Um, it's not telemedicine. I'm on top of my telemedicine notes, but it's the it's the clinic new new patients. I'm It's like I'm dreading it like I'm dragging my feet and doing it because I It's just more work because I I just feel like And also there's a part of me sometimes that questions You know, it's just it's just worth it. It would come up because I feel like I have eight hours' worth of work for what? And I, comparison to what I used to work with my old job, that I only worked three and a half hours and I get paid the same exact thing. And so there's a part of me that, yeah, I'm trying to look past this. I'm looking past this and I'm trying to look at the potential, the earning potential, because of the lean patients, lean lean cases. I'm not seeing that yet.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's slowly coming in, but it's... lean patients will come through the clinic? Will the lean patients come through the clinic? Yeah. I'm trying to get at is, is handling his clinic patients required to build the lean version of the business? Not required.
00:08:52 - Chona Sweet
It's just, I think, like...
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what we have to really get to. So... you're having this internal wrestle and Eventually a decision is going to be made for you if you get so behind your stress levels is gonna make the decision Then you're gonna walk away Because it's too much and it's overwhelming or dr. E's gonna say don't do this anymore because you're not getting the charting done And this needs even though they're overwhelmed So I don't know where that's gonna happen at some point it breaks it either gets fixed or it breaks, right?
00:09:28 - Chona Sweet
I think It's not required if the answer your question is not required however Because the lean clinics maybe that's the term the lean clinics is not full running I Don't have a reason to say hey I cannot do your clinic patients now because I'm focusing on the lean we're not there yet I don't know how long look you take so okay, but
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, hold on a second and I need you to bear with me because I have a very analytical brain and I'm also very tenacious. I go after things. If there's a problem, I'm working to solve it because it's the only reason I'm here, right? So, week after week, it's been... You've got lots going on. Remember, you've got to take all this into account. There's a lot of learning, but now we're getting into where we're having the same conversation on repeat. And just so you know, I have a few cardinal rules. One of them is I don't have the same conversation on repeat without it making progress because I cost too much money to not make progress. And if that's happening, it's either that I'm not a good fit and a good batch for you, or you're not where you should be, so you're out of sync with your own self. I don't know that that's the case. But I need you to understand that that's the way that I look at things and that's the way that I process them. Okay, so I don't just care about the business. I don't just care about the money. I can't help but care about the person that I'm working with. So seeing you, you're you're having a dilemma that needs to be solved, but you are the only one who can solve it. And until you get bought into what you really want to do, you're not going to do it. And if you're not going to do it, there is no point in me showing up every week. Does that make sense? Right. So a few of the things are, for example, in terms of consistency. Now, I understand that charting is frustrating and difficult, but here's a few other things. asked you to report wins each day, just a win every day for the week and that doesn't get done.
00:12:00 - Chona Sweet
on.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's see, hold on there or something else. Where's my Oh, so three weeks ago, I asked for and I asked for it multiple times, but I division of like what Cheryl does versus what you do, just kind of visualize I even started it graphically wrote it out for you. So there's some resistance that is happening. And I want to see if there's any way that I can help you with it. Without piling on, because it's very easy for everything to feel like piling on, like I can do stress. I can feel your overwhelm, I can feel your frustration, but also there's the mom in me that wants to make everything better. There's like I've got all these rolled tona, they come out and this doesn't mean I'm right.
00:12:54 - Chona Sweet
It's just the way that I work. That's all I'm saying. Right. And I change it.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Hold on. I want to, I got
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet
get all the way through this.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 99 charts to be behind on that, there comes a point where that you can't that can't not be taking up mental space and that cannot not be getting heavier. It has to start getting heavier and heavier. And so there is either an implosion or an explosion that's about to happen at some point. Now I don't know you, you might be somebody who can just like buckle down, sit down for the weekend and knock everything out.
00:13:31 - Chona Sweet
you that person? Yes.
00:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, I just saw Mark shake his head.
00:13:38 - Chona Sweet
But I am that person though. I, I, I passionate and I'm not consistent. Those are my, I know my biggest weakness. But when I sit down and buckle down, like I would be awake for three AM, four AM sending emails to the point that they asked me to like, do you sleep? but in at night or because they see my emails at 3 a.m. 4 a.m.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I need to send an email saying oh please get an authorization for epidural for this patient so I need to send each time so they can see that but I just feel I'm still in the overwhelmed stage and when I get overwhelmed I question if this is worth it and I start comparing what I when I used to do what I used to make before this is the problem you can't get out of overwhelm if you don't show up consistently and what you're saying is you're on an infinite loop of you're not going to show up consistently and still it it makes more sense to you but if you're looking if you're doing that math now here's the thing there's two math equations that we talked about the one is what you're making now versus what you made and then the other one is what is the potential if you see this thing through you have to decide which math you want to look at.
00:15:01 - Chona Sweet
Right? Because both are true. It's just some matter of what I mean.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, well, one is potential true and one is current truth. I need to know like, are you have you decided your and now here's the other thing is you've got some room to change things just because you feel obligated to work in the clinic right now. According to what you said, that's not you need to work in the clinic enough to understand it and know how to handle the lean patients inside of his face. But you've already gotten to that point. So what would happen if you said, okay, I'll do five five patients in the clinic a day, everything else you have to handle and that make sure I stay fresh that I stay in here. But to be honest, that's not what I'm here for. I'm happy to help out in this way or that way, whatever thing you're actually willing to help out. But Jonah, if you're if you're going to build a business and if you're going to lead and create, make the rules that work for you. But what you can't do is agree to rules and then not keep them. Right. That will ruin everything even internally for yourself.
00:16:18 - Chona Sweet
I think if I really want to, I would. I know if you really want to, sorry. I think there's resistance within me because I don't really like the clinic work. But I know that it actually is important in building my clinic muscle, if that makes sense. Yeah. the clinic muscle is what also would help me with the lean patients in terms of recognizing, oh, this is where I'm hurting. Just the symptoms. But although even though I already know because it's just a matter of a few procedures, it still helps because the hospital patients and the clinic patients are totally different. Right. the clinic patients is comparable to the lean patients.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I get that.
00:17:19 - Chona Sweet
That's why it makes sense for me to do this.
00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just that. Are the lean patients going to be as much work charting?
00:17:30 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it isn't. It isn't because it is because I'm still new on it and I'm still trying to learn the lean type of charting. It's different from how we chart. This is where Mark comes in. This is where Dr. and I'm learning through the Zoom meeting every so often on how to chart correctly. And the resistance also is Dr. E. It's Dr. signing that lean patient notes and he's a little bit resistant on how Mark thinks and how it should be done because it's different from how we do our notes for patients where we're under scrutiny and their insurance.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you deal with that? How does that stress you out?
00:18:25 - Chona Sweet
I talked to Mark about it and again because I'm in the learning stage I feel I don't feel too confident to say to stand up for it but I'm still I'm still in the learning stage it's very early like Dr. E would ask me why don't we put this why because I really don't know how to answer the question I know but I don't feel confident to tell him like why are we doing And for right now, I'm just saying because this is how the rest of the PI doctors are doing it And this is what attorneys look for, but I feel like it's not enough. He hasn't bought into it yet. He's I think he's What's the right term, He's He's not fully bought in though.
00:19:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think that honey like we're up to him to make changes and then we're not necessarily telling him why behind it There's some things that he understands why we're changing things like In a record, there's a subjective section and that's where most of the writing occurs Then there's a symptomology section where they're going through different tests, that's how they figure out what kind of pain Then there's a feeling portion and then there's a plan portion of pay.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what we're gonna do, right?-hmm.
00:19:48 - Chona Sweet
That's good that right honey like yeah for a four sections subjective what the patient says Also, yeah soap note so and he and he that's not how we charge right now with her patient. So in his mind, the way he thinks is if I get called in court of this patient that you saw, because he did in the past, you know, he's been called in, what's that term litigation?
00:20:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's been deposed.
00:20:15 - Chona Sweet
He's been deposed. So the way he answered the question is, well, this is, I'm not doing this just for the lean patients, I'm doing this is the same thing I do with the rest of my patients who's being under insurance. So that's, in his mind, it's easier to I guess defend what he does because that's.
00:20:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's got liability for your main patients?
00:20:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or not? Yes, because no one's signing it. So I talked because he understands his notes are not the best. I mean, he readily understands that he has false and his notes. His biggest issue was I want to leave in the different tests that we're doing with the patient and what the results are, where Fuji or pandellas or any of the ones. I worked with don't put that part in it doesn't make or break a case the only time it's a problem is that the client says I don't remember doing any of these tests and they're in the report It's the only time it's a problem. He's very open-minded to changing his subjective section at the top Because he's just got a very old-school way of doing it, but just right. Oh, it's cool Yeah, hey, and it's not born out of anything Negative like he's not It's just he just writes down what someone says.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:21:28 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's how we were trained.
00:21:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how we were trained Yeah, but here we're taking a legal side of no, no, let's get them even less go through so they well Have you said anything you say can't and we'll be used against you or the court of law I mean it's that kind of premise right that if you have more than there's more to It's actually not a lot to he he doesn't really but he gets fixated on one thing That's not written there, but it's actually very small like for example on the third part on the
00:22:00 - Chona Sweet
assessment part. I'm sorry on the objective part. Old school note on objective, we do it by systems. General, meaning the patient is awake, alert, oriented. Respirations, patients, long sounds. We don't do that on the lean patients. I don't put the card, your card jack is the heart rhythm normal. Like I don't do that because we don't, I don't assess it because it's the, it's a lean patient. We're focused, like Dr. Fuji's note is on the Dr.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fuji's note, he says focus physical exam.
00:22:37 - Chona Sweet
E wanted more than three systems. He wants psychiatry, skin, you know, like the old school.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you find examples of old school or more appropriately appear? So someone his age in this business that does it your way.
00:23:01 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, we killed him. He showed him and he says is someone who's in the same area.
00:23:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, roughly the same amount of practice who he's actually buy out and what he's doing. Here's the thing though. What Dr. E wants to add in doesn't make or break a case.
00:23:18 - Chona Sweet
It doesn't.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How much time does it take? What's the burden?
00:23:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the issue? Not massive.
00:23:24 - Chona Sweet
I'm asking Jonah because it's not a lot. Right now what I've been doing for lean patients is just the general appearance of a patient, a neck and a musculoskeletal back. I could add psych. could add skin. Then that's it.
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, in two minutes, tell me why you're doing any of this.
00:23:51 - Chona Sweet
Why am I doing the lean?
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, all this work with Dr. E in two minutes.
00:23:59 - Chona Sweet
I'm sorry. which one like all of it or yeah any of it like why do you show up to work every day I show up to work every day because I have to and I have I have to and I want to do the let work in the especially in the hospital I really do hold on a second hold on a second so I need you to tell me but I also need it to be true do you have to I feel like no one will be no one will be able to replace me to see those patients or I guess they can I guess they can replace me but I don't know I mean as much as I'd love to say I'm irreplaceable it might take four people to do my job but I'm not irreplaceable I don't think yeah they're right but we need to be real about the language because here's the thing if you don't tell the whole trip your brain is gonna find a loophole and it's going to tug at that
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and take you off track. So 100% all true, why do you show up to work every day?
00:25:07 - Chona Sweet
I need to work.
00:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to make money. No. Do you need to?
00:25:13 - Chona Sweet
I need to.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What will happen if you don't?
00:25:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, and then I won't have money. I am going to rely on Mark, which I don't like that.
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you feel compelled to because the feeling of relying on Mark doesn't feel good, but the truth is you don't need to and your brain knows that. Probably that's why there's no probably about your brain knows you don't have to, which makes you feel like you've got room to make choices and the choice can be, well, I'm going to do it this way and whatever happens happens. They don't have to. That's what's happening every day.
00:25:59 - Chona Sweet
That's what the wrestle is right don't have to and no matter how you phrase it the powerful chona inside knows you don't have to right so that can't be if you tell yourself that story you're wasting time and you're lying to yourself and you're setting yourself up for failure so something happens the other day and i just want to say it and then you tell me then then why because dr e was in the hospital yesterday for a he did a procedure for one of our patient and then he asked me he called me i did the procedure for the patient do you want me to rounds on the patient because i'm already here that's what he says but then you know it's up to you whatever you want to do because he's that kind of doctor he's fine he's i'm here do you want me round down many patients do we have and then i said oh we only have i believe 17 or 18 then i told him no i no it's okay i'll i'll
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
round.
00:27:01 - Chona Sweet
So what does that tell you?
00:27:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, you know, because maybe I'm not eating it because I want to see my patients. You like the hospital though?
00:27:11 - Chona Sweet
I do. That's different.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not the issue. Here's, here's the thing is where you're not showing up. That's the only issue. But you have to show up. Like you either need to be all in or get out because you're talking about building a business. And even if you were an employee, if I have somebody that was that far behind after a week and a half out of fire done, I didn't care what helped their giving me. I need to know that they're going to show up consistently. Now that's my particular baseline. That's not everybody's I hire differently, I train differently, I fire differently. It's just, but business has to be nuanced and it has to match the person, the visionary. You do have a very specific clear vision. But as we said, you're building in somebody else's house. Okay, you have to take that into account and you have to decide are you going to make your own? Which can mean I will do five clinic patients a day no more so that I do get familiar with it But because they are slightly different than lean patients because I only going to take notes this particular way when they're Lean patients and also because I just don't like it and you have the freedom to be truthful about it What's he going to say no I don't want the lean patient money? No, I don't want you to help me with at least five patients Which is 25 patients a week? Why would anybody say that? Do you know what I mean?
00:28:38 - Chona Sweet
Right?
00:28:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just feel like we're not I think what here's what I do here. Chona. I think that you can take more power Actively rather than possibly you're taking the power by not doing your work. That's possibly And actively you can take the power by saying I don't like this may sound bad, but that's the reality. love the hospital patients. Great. Some people probably don't like any of the patients. You should be happy about that. You are going to do some helping with the clinic patients and you're going to bring in lean business, which is going to help him have an entirely new income stream that wasn't available. That is sufficient. That is enough value. You live in a world where, first of all, as a woman and then also as a minority, but especially the women in your culture even, you're taught to take care of everything and to do the job and to be happy about it and to smile while we're doing it. But Feisty Chona is inside of there too and she's like, I don't like it. I don't want to do it. And Mark is nice. He can't care of myself. There's all these things going on. Chona, you're not- bad, or mean, or angry, or a , because that's what people like to call you, not you per se, but women, when they act the way that they want to act, you're not doing anything wrong. If you say, don't like this, it's burning me out. I may not even get to growing the lean business if you just crash and burn. So how about we put some guardrails on this, and we say, I'll do five, maybe 10 lean patients a day, 50 max, and I will do my charting day of, and I will agree to that. And I catch up, catch up this weekend, and just put the walls on it that actually works so that you can't get burned out. And then if you're still getting burnt out after that, you really need to have a heart to heart with yourself about what you're doing.
00:30:48 - Chona Sweet
So, right, that makes sense on the five patients a day, because I feel like right now, that's what I have, but I compacted. Monday, Tuesday, which gives me more free time on Wednesday, Thursdays, and Fridays to put in and also it's hard. I feel like I cannot Go fully tell him that oh, I'm just gonna do the lean because that we don't have a Lot of lean patients yet.
00:31:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, pause pause again This is an issue with you feeling like you owe him something or you're gonna please him or something. Hold on Let me see this all the way through You're building a business the business not there. That doesn't mean like, you know, if you let's say you open up a store and you're like well I'm not gonna I don't know what it is, but let's say you just open up a practice and it's a doctor's practice And you're there But like I'm not gonna be here because there's no people you're gonna stay there and and do the job You do what's there the lean business is the perfect reason that you're that If that didn't exist, would you even be doing any business with Dr. E if that wasn't a potential?
00:32:05 - Chona Sweet
No, I wouldn't.
00:32:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so your logic doesn't really make sense and because to me that's like guilt and you feel compelled like you're supposed to do something to please somebody else.
00:32:21 - Chona Sweet
He did verbalize it to me to mark that yeah, that he needs help with the clinic.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he can hurt people. How is that your problem? Now you guys, you can fix me.
00:32:35 - Chona Sweet
I'm coming at it.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is what I do. If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
00:32:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, there's some good news in all this because I talked to Dr. E was yesterday because he's bringing on two more hospitals. He understands children prefer his hospital over clinic practice that this is not a surprise to him because she does. She really enjoys the hospital setting and they probably like her if she likes it then. Dr. He's one of the guys where it's just yeah, whatever like he's.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean the patient.
00:33:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So Are you kidding me like they love her right? Okay, so keep going sounds good be I mean The goal is to get her to be primarily hospital link right this right Maybe one day a week because five a day wouldn't make her run around more where it would be efficient got it week And clinic would make more sense. Okay, you can see everyone a single day and use the clinic because I grew it You got to be used to clinic. You're gonna do lean treatment. I Put this is like when I started my firm like you kind of got to go through You don't necessarily like to reach the brass ring that you're going for it's short-term pain for long-term payoff But he definitely is drowning in the clinic But that being said he will take whatever lifeboat he can get at the moment Because he just needs whatever helping you get but it's still his boat chona.
00:33:59 - Chona Sweet
This is what I need you same.
00:34:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's his vote to manage. So if you want to help, help under your terms in a way that does not burn you out, but then let him handle the rest of it and be a grown- man. don't mean it disrespectfully to Dr. E. I'm using hard language because I need it to be very clear because your language, you dodge things a little bit and it's not to your benefit. I'm trying to, this is not just you by the way.
00:34:35 - Chona Sweet
Yes, yes.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Other people do this. We do this. want to be peacemakers and find the thing and sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. But you have so much power in you and it's, I definitely feel, I'm sorry, it's okay.
00:34:54 - Chona Sweet
I definitely feel not confident and not comfortable with my lean. notes and it's frustrating to um rely on mark to correct it.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember the driving analogy?
00:35:10 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
00:35:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get comfortable until you have a certain amount of experience under your belt and you have to either be okay with that or let it ruin you.
00:35:21 - Chona Sweet
And also like I have a lot of question because I'm seeing the patients. I'm writing the preliminary notes but Dr. E is signing it and then I ask Mark about this. Like should we write something in the bottom saying initially seen by nurse practitioner? I don't know.
00:35:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like should I ask the questions? Are you are you do you have access to ask the questions?
00:35:46 - Chona Sweet
Like if you have a question can you ask Mark can you ask anybody that you need to? Yeah no I asked him he said no I don't need to I don't know Dr. E just accept whatever I do and I don't want him been trouble. I don't want us to be in trouble because it's it's it's all Dr. East, but he's not seeing the patient I am. So can you handle emotional discomfort very well? Not very well.
00:36:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want to be able to handle emotional discomfort?
00:36:21 - Chona Sweet
I feel like I do, but not probably. I feel like that's a very well.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you want to have emotional discomfort? means when it comes, do you want to be able to handle it and work through it so it doesn't dominate you?
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yes, of course.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. The only way to get there? That's a muscle. That muscle, you know how hypertrophy works, right? Tear, heal, grow. It's hypertrophy that you need to have happening in you on an emotional level. This is uncomfortable. It's going stay uncomfortable, the only way to get comfortable is to continue to do it. And to do it consistently, it will happen fastest with the most consistency. And I will say in addressing the issue, so if you get an unsatisfactory answer, you need to push for more specificity. So if you can't get it from go to mark, and then you remind us to look, you guys, we're in business. I'm the one that has to do this thing, and I, I'm not going to do it. If I don't feel confident that I'm doing it right, my brain doesn't work that way. I will stress myself out to death if I can't feel confident in it. So maybe there's some level of discomfort I have to deal with, but at the very least, you can give me an accurate, clear answer, and I don't care. Nobody gets to give you and I don't care.
00:37:57 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I definitely. It's the amount of confidence Dr. E is putting on me, it is, you know, it's definitely scary because I would do the notes. Do you care about your job? Yes.
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You try really hard.
00:38:20 - Chona Sweet
Not hard enough, baby.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how it asks you. I said do you try really hard?
00:38:25 - Chona Sweet
I think I try hard.
00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know anybody that does any job perfectly?
00:38:29 - Chona Sweet
No.
00:38:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, are you holding yourself to unrealistic expectations?
00:38:40 - Chona Sweet
Not sure.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things that we have to work here. The biggest thing, this is a loop. We're caught in a loop right now. This is your lack of confidence and your first with the finances and because you're comparing apples to right now, the other job you had and how much it made versus this job plus the potential with also you like the hospital work but not the clinic work. So you've got all these things and those things are causing you to not show up. You not showing up is causing you to not get good at the things which will give you confidence. The only way through this is for you to make a firm decision period and then show up regardless of what it feels like. Do you have the ability to force yourself to do that and if the answer is yes the things have to change first. Do you have the fortitude to make the changes even if you feel uncomfortable by leaving him hanging because he needs more help.
00:40:06 - Chona Sweet
Yes, the answer is yes. I can do that.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:40:11 - Chona Sweet
In your words then, what can you Um, well, I wanted to do continue the hospital to telemedicine and limit the time.
00:40:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like one day a week, like Mark was saying, so you're not driving there so often.
00:40:37 - Chona Sweet
Right now it's two days a week, right now it's Monday, Tuesday.
00:40:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, cutting it down just Monday helped you out. Make a difference.
00:40:45 - Chona Sweet
I think it will. I will have to tell him about it.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going teach you about energy sandwiches.
00:40:53 - Chona Sweet
Because right now they, they schedule a way in advance.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're going to have to get through that, but I'm going to tell you this really quick for your difficult conversation, okay? Before you have to go do something that really, really, really sucks, do something that you really, really like in kimbooster energy, could be your favorite song, if there's a song that comes on and you can't wiggle, there's like a billion of those for me, put that on. If it's eating something, if it's going outside, if it snuggles, it does not matter what it is. If there is something that fills you up and makes you feel good, do that first, and then plan for something good, also like it, especially if it's physical. Physical activities are very good for helping to get stress out of the body, a workout, but any good physical activity of a husband, I'll let you be creative. I'm just telling you, it's important to understand the ways to manage stress and difficult things. When you're growing through difficult periods and you have to do uncomfortable things, it's really important to be conscious about what you're doing before. or after because you can help yourself get through those things without residual stress, which helps prevent or alleviate existing burnout. You're already burnt out. This is a danger zone. I do everything I can in all of my stuff to prevent burnout. All of the systems that I create, all of the processes I create are to prevent burnout because once it happens, and businesses crash, people quit, relationships go to crap, all kinds of bad things happen. Burnout is really dangerous on a physical level, on a stress level. It keeps psychiatrists and psychologists in business. It's a big thing and you're here right now. So the only way to get this is to power through it. But there are tools that you can give to kind of stack the depth for you. And it's just being conscious of the things that physically in a moment can Boost your energy like without fail. It might be sabotage to go eat cheesecake before you go have a difficult conversation But if that conversation is life-altering and it's gonna change the course of your career one cheesecake I'm gonna kill you. Don't tell my doctor. said that I have diabetes, but whatever. I Don't care I use tools. I use energy so sunshine when the Sun is out I am a bear in the winter. struggle so bad because I'm so affected by the weather today I napped for hours and I didn't want to because it was slushy like when when Whenever the weather's like that the black oak hurt and I don't even know it's bad and I still feel different Anyway, energy is really important and you have to manage it and it will help you mentally Be able to get over things you have to put things in the parameters that will work for you and Stop doing it because you feel like you have to do something you have a conversation with Mark like does it? to be like this. What happens if I do this? Not, will he be mad? Not will I not be helping enough? That that's not your job. Your job is to go bring in a new source of income. Inside of that, there are things that you need to know. You need to know how to work in his office. You need to know how to do the charting correctly for the liens because it's a legal issue versus just, you know, but if you know that you love the hospital and he's got patients that you can be helpful with air, if you know that you're understanding the clinic enough that as the lien patients come in, you're going to do a good job. And in the beginning, you can spend extra time with Mark, any other doctor that can help you out, make sure that you're covering everything right. Then you need to trust that over time, it's going to be like driving the car. All of these scary decisions that you have to mentally process are just going to be automatic.
00:44:57 - Chona Sweet
Great.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... But it starts with getting up, going to work, catching up on your part and not getting behind. If you have, you catch yourself getting behind, then have a threshold where like if I'm 20 behind, if I'm 30 behind, I don't go anywhere, I don't sleep in, don't anything until I've caught up. Like created, I don't know what the number is, I just were out of number, but you need to create that because here's what you need to remember is that if you get over a threshold, you will burn out. It just will happen. There will be a burnout threshold. You've already hit it. So keep all of those things in mind. And then the other thing I need you to know is that I think we were together good. really like it. But if I need you to do the assignments, so like sending me the wins, I'll tell you the reason that I ask for them is because of energy. want you to focus on something good at the end of today. I want to purposely shift your energy to something that you're happy about. Right. Just because I asked now, if you said, Tina, I don't want to do that, we wouldn't do it. You didn't. You just didn't do the work. And I'll give you an example. So I used to ask Mark to do a gratitude journal. And we talked about talked about and he didn't do it. And he's like, I don't really want to do that. That's not my thing. Like, okay, he's like, but this is what I am doing. I'm taking Dolce for a walk and we go for walks in the morning. And you know, so he came up with his own system that helps affect his energy that worked for him. So you don't need to follow anybody blindly. That is not going to be where you find the most joy or success. It's where you go, okay, I see the concept. I think for some value in that, but that system that you're coming up with, Tina, that doesn't work for me. How about we do this or how about I do that. Like I want you to drive. I'm here to facilitate not to drive. Does that make sense?
00:47:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. It does. I think I'm definitely not good and I tell Mark and I don't tell you. That's that's the difference. And I tell him like my wins. I was we were just talking when I was driving and I said this is what happened today. This patient said this and this to me. There's positive and negatives and I'm taking the positives. So I'm not good in telling you that but I do tell Mark. And I do like the sending voicemas. Sometimes though I get so I feel bad sending you late late at night.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. No I put everything in.
00:47:57 - Chona Sweet
Do not disturb.
00:47:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can send me anything you want to. Anytime.
00:48:00 - Chona Sweet
Okay, because I, I'm sure there are those messages before that it was so late.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you've never thought of me.
00:48:08 - Chona Sweet
I'm surprised that you respond sometimes.
00:48:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, I have teenagers, so we sleep when we sleep. Also, I was born an insomniac. I'm not an insomniac. actually sleep really good, but I'm a, I wake up at night. can be exhausted all day for three days in a row. I can exercise. can do everything to wear myself out and be exhausted around 10 o'clock.
00:48:31 - Chona Sweet
My body goes, let's go.
00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's annoying.
00:48:34 - Chona Sweet
You, you mentioning that that actually is something I needed to say is ever since I start working there long ago now. Is it one and a half month, huh? I started September, but one and a half month, I wake up at three and four and I know when that happens, I'm stressed out. So I think, and then I try to sleep more.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can't, that's why I'm sleeping in. You know that that's when quarter
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
All peaks two to three o'clock in the morning.
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you also know that one of the biggest reasons that happens is late nine meals? I learned that recently.
00:49:09 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I've been eating bait because sometimes I would finish my charting 11, 30, 12.
00:49:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually forced myself to sleep. So one of the things that I learned is that if you just take like a 20-minute walk after whenever you eat, even if you're just walking in place and pacing around the house, I know that because I do that. It can offset that cortisol spike at two or three o'clock in the morning, which generally is combined with a potty break because the cortisol empties your bladder. I don't know if you know that but that happens a lot.
00:49:42 - Chona Sweet
So that happens even when I fast. do fasting sometimes. do long fasting and that happens even with that. So I think you're right. It's just that I feel, I do that when I'm grieving Yeah
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm stressed out so it's I would back it back to energy management and stress management and knowing yourself and doing whatever just Do you do like do you know what actually it calms you and makes you peaceful? Is there anything that you know of that? I just do that.
00:50:20 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I just playing and by doing nothing Just doing this What are you doing when you're laying in bed, but I would read stories or I would do tik-tok just mindless And I want something funny. I want to laugh like I would When I when I see something funny and then I read the comments that makes me laugh So I laughing is is very good for me.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a big snuggler snuggler's work for me But there's only one person and he's in Arizona So I don't get that access a lot my my grandbaby though. I got to hold her that would do it for me Um, when it's summertime being out in the pool. I'm that's so happy. When I get lots of sunshine, I'm very happy. um, massages, my masseuse is amazing. Um, she does reflexology. That's something, but you could also, you know, I don't know when's the last time you went to the doctor and had your lab checked, had your personal levels checked.
00:51:19 - Chona Sweet
Have you thought about me doing that? Sure.
00:51:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know.
00:51:23 - Chona Sweet
I know where the worst patients, I know this mark. I remember when meeting Mark long when we first met, I went the one like encouraging him and pushing him on to seeing his doctor and do this, do that, get, get your vaccines. then now he's very good in taking care of himself. And then I am not so amazing in these lives that I've worked with.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, not because of me.
00:51:52 - Chona Sweet
I mean, I've just watched it is what I mean. Yeah, I know he's very good in taking care of himself and, you know, that's commendable. But you probably want you to take care of yourself, too, right? I Don't want to say that I'm giving myself grace and isn't you know in during this grace period But I I feel like I am in that grace 90 day period of this new place When you're building a business, it's it's grit that you need more than grace and Now look Right, it's a shift of mindset. I'm not I feel like I'm not totally there yet This is the first time I'm doing this and I feel It's not fully shifted my my mindset and Can I ask you a question that Just ask me okay Do you talk your do you are you good at talking your way out of things and have you done that your whole life? Oh, yeah, you think you're doing that now, right? I'm rationalizing why why I do what I do or how I why I
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what I feel. Is that getting you where you want to be?
00:53:04 - Chona Sweet
No, but I feel it's what I need at the moment to comfort myself.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that goes back to you. Do you want to deal with be able to deal with emotional discomfort?
00:53:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, that would be emotional comfort, but do you want to be able to deal with it? I feel like we've been dealing with it.
00:53:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just don't know if it's the right thing. what just we're gonna have next week's call and if you think I'm right about anything, all I want you to do is just say you're right and just not explain it, not anything and just sit with it. It's really gonna suck. I want you to be able to sit with things being uncomfortable and not need to fix it or try to make a feel better. Will you do that with me next week?
00:53:57 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:53:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you see? any benefit in doing that?
00:54:01 - Chona Sweet
You mean, like, for example, what's you mean?
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, if I went through and looked at the notes from today's call, we can talk about multiple reasons, multiple issues that we brought up, and then you explaining what's happening. And I don't want you to do that. I want you to acknowledge, there's something that isn't going the way that adopt you, and just sit in it, and not explain it. Just let that sit there and not try to make it feel better. Does that doesn't make sense now? don't know. I probably didn't change it at all.
00:54:39 - Chona Sweet
That makes sense.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just practice. It's just acclimation. I am a type A perfectionist. I was picked on a lot, and also, firstborn daughter, so people pleaser. But also, I learned, because I'm a very angry abusive mom, literally abused me. And so I got really good with dodging the hand with my mouth by saying things to placate and please and excuse and to justify. And I'm also very smart, I'm good at doing that, but I was blessed to have people call me out of my crap. And because of them, I grew and I want to grow more than I want to be comfortable. I want to grow more than I want to be right. That wasn't always true because being wrong was so uncomfortable for me. It physically painful, I still get physical anxiety, I will replay everything I've said every day to everyone, even if they thought it was great and look at all the ways I did wrong. Still, I'm 48 years old. should not be... doing it. So now I do it way less than I used to. But there's still a lot of anxiety. And I feel like crying telling you about it. It's a physical, visceral response. Like I could hang up and just go cry for five minutes. And it's stupid to me. I don't want to do that. That's annoying. It's frustrating. I'm strong. And that crying would not keep me from doing the hard thing. But I'm like, I don't say the things that would make me uncomfortable or say all the things that made me uncomfortable. But Chona, there is so much liberation in being able to sit in emotional discomfort and being able to be wrong and being able to be exposed in wrongness and learn the ear with people who will be like, okay, so Mark and I work with Dan. Also, it happens with Mark. I'll say something and I'll be completely wrong. Just cool. is wrong, not understand something, Dan will just completely disagree with me. he'll make that sound, but he's not being disrespectful. He's just got his thoughts and his opinions, and it's a safe space. But because I was able to sit and not try to be like, why did you say this? no, I didn't mean that, you know, and try to make it better. I've learned that I can just be myself around people, but also I can ask difficult questions, or I can say some of my crazy thoughts. And a lot of times they're right, and they're good. And because I'm bold enough to do that, because I'm okay with being wrong, I get to have the joy and the experience of being bold, right? And I also get to have the learning experience of being wrong and being corrected quickly, or redirected, or instructed quickly. So, or you can just get a new perspective, because I'm willing to say things and be vulnerable. Most people don't like it. make a lot of people uncomfortable, especially my Sunday school teachers. Most of them can't stand me. that's okay. But because of that, I've just found my niche in this world and it's amazing because I felt hated all of my childhood and a good portion of my adulthood, especially I married somebody that treated me just like my mom did. So my point is is that the only way to get comfortable and to not feel trapped by emotional discomfort is just to kind of embrace it. But I can tell you like not many people can from experience the power of the contrast between being trapped by trying to avoid that discomfort and the power of just fully embracing it and asking difficult questions, making demands like, okay, I'm not going to work more than one day a week. And you know what, I'm only going to do one day a week every other week because I really don't like it. And I'm just going to take this whole week off like whatever whatever it is you've got to figure out what works for you. But trust that if you're managing it that way, you're going to be in your superpowers. That means like when you're at the hospital taking care of hospital people, you're going to be the best down nurse protection they've ever seen. And they're going to love you. And you're going to do amazing. And then when you do the lean patients, you're going to have more energy for that because you're not burning out with the other things that you don't want. Nobody is going to architect the ideal situation for you, but you can. You just have to be honest about what you're doing, why you're doing it. What you don't want to do, stop doing what you don't want to do or tell yourself, I'm going to, because it really is going to be the only way that I get to what I want to. But whatever it is, make sure that you're telling the same story all day, every day, or what you're going to have is this dissonance inside of yourself, and it's really going to rip at you.
01:00:22 - Chona Sweet
Understood.
01:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think about that more than understood?
01:00:30 - Chona Sweet
I know that I'm not doing really good, I'm not 100% in. I feel that I'm just doing it because to show face right now, I could, myself, because to show face for myself. self. I know that I'm not consistent.
01:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think you can have these?
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
I know, I know I can be. just have to make that decision that I'm fully fully in. I mean, you know, yeah, I just feel I'm not there yet because I don't want to be. I'm not.
01:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. That's what that's what you need to do is be flexible.
01:01:34 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I'm not decision that you're that you're in yet. Yeah, I thought I would be in and then I realized Oh, this is this is a lot of work. I don't write. I don't like this.
01:01:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So ask this question though Is there a way that you see where you can be in like maybe you only do clinics twice a month one day every other week? I know that might sound extreme to you and I don't know. that's reality. But what I'm asking you, is there a way that you can craft the situation?
01:02:06 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I think I think I I think I've become money focus. And the reason why I say that is I noticed myself committing more to my lean patients in clinic patients. So I will work around, I will drive to wherever I set the page. For example, I called the patient and I gave them two options where they can go and they go far from Huntington Beach. They went there, they went to the south location. So I drove there no problem early, like 9.30, like I don't have a problem. So I noticed that I definitely lit up when I know that this is and make me more. I think that's where it's that. And I feel that the current one is it's not where it's at. That's why I don't like it. And that's the truth that as much as I say, I don't want to treat patients just because of the money. But the lean patient, it's hard not, it's hard not to admit that it is the truth.
01:03:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could stop judging yourself and that's okay, that's what motivates you.
01:03:24 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it does motivate me like, okay.
01:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so be okay with that. Practice being able to say the whole truth exactly as it is. I'm not insinuating your lying or anything. I'm saying is just that's emotional discomfort also to claim what you want and who you are and be okay with it.
01:03:47 - Chona Sweet
By the way, what I just told you is totally against my ethics would work. Because I don't, this is, and I've worked with, I work at Cedars, I work with UCLA. We were, I take care of whatever from homeless to Prince of Dubai or whatever. I know that's the one thing that I hate is, but I just need to say because I don't know why because it's it's it's against what it is that everybody is there is no such thing as altruism.
01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you why if I do something just to make you smile and make you feel good, this side effect is going to be, I know I made you smile and feel good and it's boost to my ego and I get the joy of your energy. I know I get something back even if it's just feeling like I did something for you. There is no real pure altruism. We are all motivated by what we get back, whether we acknowledge it or not. Right. There are different currencies. Sometimes we get happiness back.
01:05:00 - Chona Sweet
we get comfort back. Sometimes we get a favor back.
01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes we get a paycheck, but we all receive a currency for our currency that we extend out to others. So then everybody's out of right?
01:05:17 - Chona Sweet
Or nobody is.
01:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people are just more honest about it than others. Let ask you one more thing. If you go and make a million dollars, are you going to keep it all to yourself?
01:05:29 - Chona Sweet
Are you going to spoil the people that you love? I mean both, definitely, because I would love to spoil, you know, if you, and then what did I get from that? go, I get what you're saying, but I guess what I'm trying to say is because when I used to work, I work as an employee in my mind. I'm just, I'm doing this because of my job, but not directly because I'm getting, it's hard to explain yourself that not what I'm going to tell you. Yeah, just the mindset, the shift on the business mindset is different. And I don't, Knowing if I'm if I'm overthinking it Judging yourself.
01:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what you've been doing with everything. You're judging your handwriting You're judging your language. You're judging your motives, and you need to stop that If you want to be happy You've got to just embrace who you are and know that other people are blessed for knowing you this guy loves you Like there's got to be something good about you. Your patients love you Your family loves you, I would assume You just being you I mean not all families, but so Just love you and be okay with that and know that You getting what you want and what energizes you and motivates you makes you a more potent version of you Makes you get more good things done Whatever the children of things are you're gonna be more empowered because you're gonna Stop being held down by a judgment and direction and shame and doubt.
01:07:02 - Chona Sweet
Right. Right. I could. I could do a lot more with being having a routine and having time management because controlling my own schedule is the best and that more thing that can happen to me.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:23 - Chona Sweet
So we can talk about that, but ultimately you're the only one who can do anything about it.
01:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. It has to be a bigger thing other than I'll be more productive if I have a better schedule. have bigger reasons. You'll sleep better. You'll probably make better decisions because we know cognitive function drops when you're tired and exhausted. You'll be more healthy, more consistent. The close levels will be more level, which means your cravings will be more level, which means your energy levels will be more level. Like if there's, if you want to sit there and have lots of conversations to try to motivate yourself, we could do that. the end of the day, it's going to come down to rob discipline.
01:08:04 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The discipline is a muscle. You work it slowly, you grow it slowly. It doesn't happen all at once.
01:08:13 - Chona Sweet
And almost always, it looks like this. Right. Mark wakes up very early and well, initially for Dolce, but you know, even without Dolce, still wakes up early.
01:08:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you guys are opposite like circadian rhythm types.
01:08:33 - Chona Sweet
Right. I'm work, I sleep late, I woke up late. I mean, even if I sleep early, I woke up 3, 4 a.m. then I sleep in again.
01:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's not a solution to everything when it comes to sleep and schedules. Some of it is just rough. That's life. We can't solve for everything.
01:08:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All sort of saying, I am for me in our office.
01:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I want to sleep in late, I really couldn't. Yeah, so what I want you to think about is what can you be the architect of what can you change and I don't mean just yourself like Did I have your read that book switch?
01:09:12 - Chona Sweet
No, I haven't that's fine.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will power.
01:09:16 - Chona Sweet
I need you to read that book. I have it on like audible That's another thing we've talked about that you said you were doing didn't do it. need.
01:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah um, I said you'd like to read at night.
01:09:28 - Chona Sweet
It's relaxing No, it's I listen to I like listening to the books.
01:09:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I start listening to the 48th, but that I wasn't able to Complete it do you switch because it's how to make change when change is hard Right and it's entertaining. They did a good audible version.
01:09:46 - Chona Sweet
It's very good. So I would say though that in terms of Cheryl I think we were able to go past the resist I mean in a way because now for example the two patients that comes in they emailed me first we are only two months in by the way that's pretty good yeah they emailed me first and then i see see her and then the other person that you know is in charge with the lien it's cast and Cheryl i emailed them so they're part of that loop of email with this case manager of this lawyer so and it's been work i send them the the notes and then cast send the bill of she sent my name on the bill as a provider or as the medical provider i told her changes make it dr e which she did it it worked so it you know architected that you know saying you did it your way right i wanted that yeah she she said she said no tell them to email me it's like no no no no that's not how it's going to work but also i've become i i you know she we just celebrated her but at her birthday the other day and I was there. I'm showing up for the other non-work part. I really wanted to be okay with not just with her but everyone. I don't know about pug stuff, was cute. Yeah, he's a dog person.
01:11:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he got her a pug. That's a good thing.
01:11:21 - Chona Sweet
like dog people.
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know she's four not dog people.
01:11:25 - Chona Sweet
She's never met a person who's not a dog person that I liked. She works hard too. think she realized now that okay I'm not trying to take away or be not including you. She's included on everything that I do.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really good growth in two months.
01:11:43 - Chona Sweet
So I feel good about a lot of the things that are happening but and also if you're not okay well that was that's a test um but
01:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I we have to get, um, you know, anyway, we talk about pacing, but also looking at the clock and I think somebody's got plans tonight.
01:12:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, we do very pretty soon, but this is really, really, really important because it's or get off the pot kind of type situation. You know, those when I use language like that. We have a prostitution analogy today.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, but you're not serious. I already had to apologize to God today.
01:12:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, either here nor there. Next up, these things about me anyway. I think for tell me if I'm wrong, but this seems like what you want to do because you understand how it's different than what you were doing before in terms of what your long-term potential is and correct me if I'm wrong because I think what's in this saying and I don't mean to speak for you again, but if you were much happier what you were doing before and you want to be handcuffed or only earning a certain amount. you are able to physically show up and not have the flexibility that you want or the ability to make more money, but do you have to work differently and harder? There's nothing wrong with that. It's just admitting to yourself, this is what I want. And I know I nudged you in this direction pretty hard, but if this isn't what you want, it's better to say now than in a year from now.
01:13:23 - Chona Sweet
Mm-hmm. I think it's definitely hard for me not to compare, especially when I'm feeling tired and I feel like I'm doing much more work as compared to that. And I'm not even touching the potential business potential, earning potential, the other earning potential, but I'm understanding or I'm accepting that it's part of it. It's part of it, I guess.
01:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, so here's what I want like, you know, Ponderon is being the architect, okay? So when you tell yourself something about what you have to do, I want you to ask yourself, but is that true? What is actually true and what else could be true? Because sometimes opposing truths exist and it's difficult to understand how they can because it exceeds our reasoning, right? But we can sense, there seems to be evidence that this truth is true and this truth is true, but how they don't make sense. So think about, is there a way to change things so that it's not feeling like it's draining you? And also be the architect of the dialogue in your head. are you telling yourself? you catch yourself comparing the old jobs, Are you looking for a way to talk yourself out of doing your work or justifying not doing your work or making yourself comfortable with an uncomfortable situation, and ask yourself the things that I want is what I want most to make myself feel better about how I'm doing, or do I want to get to this thing and be able to deal with discomfort for a little while. So think about this conversation a little bit. If you want to send you the notes, don't know if you would read it and go back over it and look at some of the highlights, or I could just give you the bullet points of these are the things that kind of contemplate that we were talking about today. And here's the thing when you're when you're going through a growth period, your perspective shifts. I can't think of the word that I want right now. It's just I feel like my blood sugar is one of my crazy. hold on.
01:15:58 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, it's too much.
01:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're dark, but that's also, um, um, you change drastically, your perspective changes drastically, you're operating from a different standpoint, your motives and your opportunities are shifting. Um, in your perspective is shifting and part of it is allowing yourself to be honest and just say, I'm motivated by money as a healthcare worker. Fuji, I'll give you an example. I don't think he would be upset that I said this, but I asked him, you know, so why do you become a doctor? He's like, money, he's like, like, you know, he's like, I shouldn't say this, but the truth is it was a path to financial freedom and I felt like it was leverage and it's what I want. And so, you know, I talking, you know, and taking a path because I think his motives and M.O. is this, but it's really here. So just be honest, you're not the only one and I will tell you what this world would be screwed if it wasn't for the capitalistic types because they're the visionaries that actually change everything because they're honest about it and they understand psychology because they're honest about it and they're not trying to say one thing and be another. Let yourself be that way. Think about all the good that you're doing being just exactly as you are.
01:17:37 - Chona Sweet
By the way, when I say that I like the money that makes me feel bad, but at the same time, it makes me feel bad that I feel bad about it. I don't know if I added that. I want to have that mind shift of I want to make more money because I can see in Mark, but I can see in Dr. E. They have a different look in them. It's hard to articulate, but it's like, it's the business people in them like, oh, I'm doing it.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you ever read the book at this fund?
01:18:13 - Chona Sweet
No, what is that? You said, you said, at it, do you have the hand ran book?
01:18:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Let me ask you a question then before we finish, because you were with so many people in all different stations in business from startups to very established businesses to people taking over for someone who and different education and class levels like, yeah, especially the ones who are just starting or have shifted, right? How often do you see it in a slingshot where there feels like they're running through the mud? feels like they're running through the mud hitting their head against the wall. So close to quitting and then just one. Hey, it feels like one day. It's not different in your way ahead.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Almost every time, but I will tell you that there is one commonality between all of them, and that's consistency. I don't see it and people who don't show up consistently. I see those people fail and sabotage without exception. I have seen people hear me, acknowledge the truth, and show up consistently for the first time in their lives, really, for the hard things. I have seen that. I do believe it can happen, otherwise I would quit with people as soon as I see they don't show up regularly. It for sure is in there. And I would tell you what the litmus test is. had it tonight. It's talking about it. And when I ask you to not make excuses or anything, you're just like, okay, Most, anybody else that isn't going to do the work will still argue there. You didn't. So I have hope for you, but I will tell you that that catapult slingshot comes from consistency. So what you do is you build up tension. It's a compounding effect. And you have done all the things and it's almost like driving the driving lessons again. Only the difference is you're revving the engine right there and pretty soon you get to let off the gas and just go. And it in my favorite way of looking at that is a one year period. So for Mark, let's use Mark as an example. He is always the slingshot. He will just will be talking about talking about talking about things like Mark, when you're going to do this, when you're going to do this, let's just give up and stop bugging him for a little while or whatever. You'll be thinking about something and it just will piss him off and he'll just be like this driving he does I'm gonna go fix this and then he'll go into a deep dive and He'll find a solution and he'll fix it. I didn't do any of it. I'm a facilitator. Sometimes I'm a catalyst, but I don't really fix anything Sometimes I show the solution like chat GBT or cloud AI or something But really that's not the solution. It is the visionary It's the one is like, you know what what I could do and then they they get to work at it And he does that and the the pace of that is probably every several months that there's a slingshot type effect but there's one at least every year and What I was about to say was I like the Looking back over a year because I can always find a look at this Like look at this that happened to look at this that happened There's always if you think you can stack and go wow like we didn't have that last year That's pretty awesome and then it can also go I can look at some of the conversations that we had that ended up being the catalyst for that.
01:22:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, two months we did that today when we're looking at the year of, you know, we're signing things, we're looking at December and you see, like, go to the top, and then, like, pop. But it was constantly, like, running into a wall doing stuff. don't like to do repeatedly. Yes.
01:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know. don't like doing Like, you know what? You're right. I just got to do it, and you go do it, and it's amazing. And the growth, I mean, so sweet law, when we started, we were getting about 32, 30 retainers a month on average. And now, we're anywhere from, like, 82, we've had 100, over 100, or 100.
01:22:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenz, we've been working with Lorenz for, it's been six months now, but his 30 days, we've taken his average. of closing the cases to 30 days in six months and considering Lorenz's normal pace is sloth. I mean it with respect.
01:23:10 - Chona Sweet
really like him. He's a big sloth. He's huge.
01:23:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He just moves slowly. He's very just very slowly and that's not a knock on him. It's just how he is and that's okay. But what's he saying like he now knocked off 10% of what he's doing which means he will make more money. He will be less stressed out. But it took you three, four, five months to get him to that point.
01:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually started seeing the change in August when I was looking at the reports. It was very slow. It was about 10 days. So I would say about every two months there was a 10 day kind of shift and I didn't know how much confidence I felt in it like I was talking about today. I'm like I don't know how much of a difference it actually makes. But that's the thing perspective, personalities, body, these chemistry, childhood trauma, it all comes into the mix, which is why I take holistic approach to it and don't like take a Harvard business process to it.
01:24:12 - Chona Sweet
Just doing all that coffee is not good still.
01:24:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but the thing is I love what I do and I didn't always and that changed everything. It changed how much I earned. It changed how much I earned per hour because that when I became more joyful in it, I had more energy to go study, to read more books, to hone my craft, to develop my systems a little bit better and bring them back to my people. If you spend more time in the hospital, less time in the places that are draining you, that could be a potential benefit that maybe you haven't thought about because you haven't had the perspective of, I give myself permission to build the business that I want to build, the way that I want to build it, knowing that I will go bless others if I build
01:25:00 - Chona Sweet
business that blesses me. Right and I actually love that part that yes wanted to make more money I want to see more patients because I get paid for patient but at the same time I as compared to how I was in the past I've been very much open and grateful to appreciation when patients express oh I want to like today I want to talk to the nurse practitioner who I talked to last month because I want to thank her that is me you talk to me and yeah no thank you the procedure that you recommended I did it and it worked my pain is over 70 percent better so again I have a patient the other day like I need your card because I want to make sure it's a hospital patient I want to make sure that they keep you I just had an epiphany because you're talking about you know the lean patients and it making you money but that's the hospital doesn't make you more money right?
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doesn't I get paid stick would be real quick because we're going to close this up and I think Oh, I remember you telling me that what you liked about the oh actually maybe it's the other way around in the hospital you can give them the treatments that they need or is it in the clinic in the hospital it's quick instant relief and I tell I can see it the next day like today like multiple times I gave something or I did something and then they're much better the next day and they go home early that was it so part of what I think makes you happy is you actually get to help people feel better so yeah so but I want you to remember that that is a motivator for you or you wouldn't like the hospital so much right though you taking care of people is very important to you making them feel good and be better is very important to you it's okay that it's also true that making more money and not doing tedious charting is something that you
01:27:00 - Chona Sweet
I'd better.
01:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's okay for you to be nuanced and complicated. You're a woman.
01:27:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But I don't remember any time you come home from the site hospital.
01:27:11 - Chona Sweet
No, I honestly don't know.
01:27:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's true that was thankful to you. Or that you saw this and the pain went away because of your recommendation.
01:27:21 - Chona Sweet
And in the last month, there's been four, five, six.
01:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really good column. That's really good column.
01:27:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Money exactly the same. And you had to work a little bit harder with the hospital stuff, but you got that sense of joy.
01:27:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. No, the patient.
01:27:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
up with it.
01:27:41 - Chona Sweet
Even Tina, she saw you light up with it. It's a completely different change with you. Yeah.
01:27:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
you know, this bag, you get all excited.
01:27:50 - Chona Sweet
Well, the one who I talked to today is a phone call. Yes, it's longer. I talk to them every month. But patients light up if I give them their We feel which of narcotics, which is fine, whatever, but this is different when they say hey, know, you know, you really think you or, you know, I don't know.
01:28:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They've been trying to sell their pain and they've been trying to get someone to help them and you help them solve an issue that's been killing the sickle cell person talking about where watching it off, you spent time to figure out a solution that actually helped them.
01:28:22 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, whether the black patient because that's not neglected even there. Yeah, yeah, no, I have a, I have a little bit of a bias with sickle cell patients because I, it's a painful disease and they get very dependent to it and they were dubbed as seeking because their pain is not controlled.
01:28:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just, why people don't understand it that's why I'm serious medicine and a lot of treatments where you'll find the greatest innovation is where the people with the money. have experienced it and so they've innovated in that particular area. It's not even a racist thing. That's just that that's just the reality.
01:29:09 - Chona Sweet
So anything. Yeah, no, it's true. That's why you know, not a lot of people like what I do. lot of people I talk to like, why are you in pain? Is this deal with the patients who are in pain and they're addicts and they're they're it's.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister works in a methadone clinic.
01:29:24 - Chona Sweet
Did I tell you that? Yeah, you did told me not everyone not everyone likes to work even psych patients. And I have a, you know, I know, Marcus, it's very, very hard on me. I take in a lot of of it, but I feel bad for them. everyone wants to help them.
01:29:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's it's sad, you know, but that's all the more reason why that by the way, the skill of being able to sit in negative energy and not let it be taken in is a really important skill.
01:29:56 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not deflecting it. It's letting it be there, but not letting absorb and impact you, right?
01:30:05 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:30:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's something that I can help you with. God put me through it from infancy. So that was a skill that I got to develop. But you have so much to give. I really want you to practice not judging yourself and just being able to speak openly about how you feel about things. Yeah. And ask, you know what, can this be done in a different way that I actually like? Yeah. And understanding that you liking something is not being petty or impetuous or anything like that. It's you managing energy. And with you having maximized energy, first of all, better quality life, better quality relationships, but also better quality service. Your brain works better. thoughts will be more creative. You'll be more powerful and potent in all ways. Right. need to justify making the way that you want to. It's because you'll bring better everything to every table.
01:31:04 - Chona Sweet
You go to right Yeah, I know like I always feel better when I talk to you I'm glad because I did so much.
01:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know she's gonna like me tonight, but I know I do and again, I Appreciate the nudge.
01:31:20 - Chona Sweet
I appreciate them honesty because it's what I needed, you know when I need it I know I'm not I know I there's a lot of things I need to do it's just a matter of me.
01:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's you baby wanting to do it.
01:31:32 - Chona Sweet
I don't I don't pay anybody to tell me what I need Well, we do all need to go because we need to be And get a clock so we have woman to get dressed in chains. Thank you so much.

> 00:00:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good to see both of you guys.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you guys doing?
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Sleepy.
00:00:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Actually, I'm running for nap.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the time. Yeah, I'm glad we were able to connect today. And Lorenz has been like a year since I've spoken to you, huh?
00:00:46 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yeah, last time we spoke with Sam.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how are you feeling about your numbers? Well, let's see. I have so many questions, actually. They all fight in my brain and want to come out at the same time. so usually I just trip over them and eventually something comes up. Yeah, so let's see, I'm curious about your numbers, although I've been looking at them because I look at them every week with Mark on a whole, not always individually. And I know we have talked about Cynthia and how she works, but now she's on Pat's team, right? Yeah. So let's start with just kind of a recap of what you remember about what we discussed last year. And anything that it's, I don't know that you might have kind of applied or feel like forgot, didn't apply, whatever, your overall thoughts from your experience last year to now.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sure. So I think my real life things is, you know, trying to, I think, struggling managing individual members on the team. And we were working on trying to find everyone's strengths. We can't play to their strengths at the time. And so I've been trying to do that and not apply like a preset system on everybody equally. So I'm using everyone's strengths. You know, I split my, I have two teams, essentially. I have Jessica and Mike and John and Viri. And they, it's the same task. All the same tasks get done. the division of the task is a little bit different from one team to another based on their strengths.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And how do you feel like that works for you? What do you notice about? just day-to-day operations. It could be in terms of cohesion on the team, how people feel like just kind of mood, satisfaction, their own satisfaction. There are so many different nuances to how we perform operations that impact us as people, but also as output. How do you feel like that works for your team?
00:03:34 - Lorenz Schuerch
I think they like the general idea. think the issue that we run into a lot is we have these goals and all five of us are very goal oriented, like knowing the expectations and so we all kind of sit down at the beginning of the month, go through the cases we'd like to set, all cases we'd like to close. And then invariably there's always, you know, it's like every day there's like crises that take away our time. And you know, there's clients that are just about to fire you because I never get a call back and I look into the case and, you know, we're talking to that person every other day. And so it's, you know, it's on some of us a little frustrating because it feels like, you know, the biggest, uh, variables that client themselves.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Um, so that's interesting too. Let me end that.
00:04:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. Like today I spent an hour with a client who, uh, you know, wasn't happy with her conversation with Mike yesterday and I basically said, well, she had a list of questions. And I went through all of her questions one by one and essentially said the exact. same thing Mike told her yesterday, but she was super happy. And, you know, she loves us now. But yeah, to take an hour out of my time out of the things I had to set out to do today, to talk to her and repeat the exact same thing Mike told her yesterday.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, um, that's good information. So I'm going to just kind of recap that the way that it's, well, and we only got to talk once and we've only talked once. We'll around you and I twice, but there was one as a startup and then just a follow up. But so Mark has committed to six months to work together for the three of us. And what I do with my clients is basically just take a holistic approach. So it's a lot of information gathering. And then it's a matter of prioritizing and ranking what we discuss and what we'll have the biggest impact. what's the biggest lover in the business in your day to day operations and things like that. So though we're just starting kind of working together, I've been with Sweet Law for three years. So we've been talking, you know, Mark and I every week for the last three years. And so some of the things that we're working on is going to kind of and overlap. So one of the things that we were talking about trying to figure out is how do we do, how do we create a client ranking system with intake so that we can improve our intake script and process to potentially if even possible because there's such a wide variety of types of cases that you take as well as types of people. And we can't, you know, just cherry pick everything, right? But, but are there ways of determining through potentially profiling and through recognizing through conversation very early through the script, what types of people are going to show up are going to do the work, you know, because there's always a portion where they've got to get us their information and, and do the reporting, will they return our phone calls, will they return our emails, all of those types of things. And so, anyway, not that we have enough information do any of that now, but, but, but all of the things that you share will be useful because then I can go back and we can look at and you guys might find that there are some parallels in what you experience. And one of you might say, well, actually we had that same issue and this is how we did it. So, there's a couple of things just as a general practice that I try to do. with all clients across all business types and it doesn't work uniformly and sometimes it's just not applicable but for example starting up the day proactively versus reactively meaning whatever planning we're doing whatever organizing we're doing and whatever we've prioritized as being the most important thing to accomplish those things get done beginning of the day as quickly as possible so that when we get pulled to the fires you know the things that have to be dealt with in a timely manner have to take time the things that were most important the things that moved the needle the furthest let's say it's a really high high level case right maybe it's a death case and and there's it's higher priority because of the client because of the client's needs and the impact it has in their lives but also what it's worth to sweet-law so What we'll try to figure out is are there ways that we can better structure either our day or the team or our styles of communication with customers or within the team where we have more time and more energy for higher value, higher impact activities, and we're either triaging the lower level stuff. Potentially delegating it. There's a lot of variety. You know how you manage a team, but those are the things that we're going to be looking at, seeing if there's things that we can do to improve. We'll take best practices and then I'll also take some of this information back to Mark and see if there's some feedback where he can help. So point being all of this is discovery. All of this is useful. And that's kind of I just wanted to talk about the approach of how we're going to be doing it since we haven't covered that yet you and I learned and Pat and I did that last week so just make sure this isn't a child it's not in mute everything sorry about that. Okay, so you were talking about. So how many people do you have on your team and I'll have your list right now. I've got four. And remind me who they are please.
00:10:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
So there's Jessica and Mike. And then there's John and Mary.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike are your case managers.
00:10:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, John is a case manager. So they're split into two teams. So Jessica and Mike do mostly the Spanish speakers. And then John. And they're both case managers and then. and John and Vary have more of a traditional split where John does most of the case manager asks and Vary does more of a record request and things like that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two were kind of a pair, weren't they, that are newer to the team? Very, didn't she come from somewhere else?
00:11:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, she came, I think she came from Sweet James maybe, I'm not sure.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was thinking not, but did she and John work together before? No. It wasn't them, okay.
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But Mike and Justin.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mike and Justin, okay. I knew that there was a newer two people that had worked together and kind of came together. Okay. So how do you, when do you have your meetings, how do you meet set your goals like as a weekly, do you have daily meetings, how do you look?
00:12:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
So right now we went through a few iterations and I try to get as much feedback as I get from them. We used to meet as a full team every other day and then the feedback I got was that there's a lot of, when we were going through cases for the other team, the opposite team didn't feel like there's a lot of value so now I'm meeting with individual teams every other day and we kind of do file reviews. We do, you know, if there's any fires to put out, we do those and then we kind of cases along.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been
00:13:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
doing it that way about a month and how do you feel that's going for you it's going good I'm yeah I think I like the idea of doing foul reviews as a team it seems like we're all on the same page at the same time rather than information you know trickling in from different slack channels and we we have a better overall trajectory for each case what what's next you know how do we move this case along faster and you've only been doing this for a month but you you notice the trajectory changing and improving yeah yeah and we have a lot less a lot fewer cases while stagnating
00:14:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that was primarily, would you say, from, um, the file reviews together?
00:14:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
So all five of you doing that? Well, no, because their cases are split up. So like now I do, I do them with the, I do the, okay.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So file rules together per team.
00:14:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
So team.
00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, that's great. I'm, I'm really interested to see how that continues to improve, are you getting good feedback from them?
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
They like that. Oh, they love it. They, I've gotten really good feedback from all four of them. They say they, this is the, the best thing. just. Let's go. Leader.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
job.
00:14:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good job. It took some. Several iterations.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As I said. Yeah. That's the thing about growth, though, it does. It takes several. Okay. Good iterations and you know there are different things that can throw a wrench in it just somebody having a major life event can do it um you know there's there's so many different things because at the end of the day it's just it's people and um we've got a lot going on so um let me keep an eye on the time because I want to make sure we we cover everything I'm really I'm really excited for that so you do you remember reading the book multipliers that we talked about yeah um do you feel like you are staying mindful of um looking for ways to kind of nurture and develop leadership in each of your team members I could be better I could I could do better I used to I used to make time to have like an individual kind of like check
00:16:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
with each cheating team member like once a month and then you know people get sick they took some days off and it just kind of fell out you know a few months ago and to get back on the board especially with a new member very she's super super shy and so that's really hard to get it's like pulling teeth trying to get information out of her.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like that's her all the time or that it's a work situation and she maybe doesn't feel safe in in the work environment to speak her mind?
00:16:44 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not necessarily because you've created that but I see what you're saying you know it's hard for me to say at a distance I know that you know I I know she's a single mom with four kids, so I've always tried to, anytime she has a doctor's appointment or something like that, I to be as accommodating as possible.
00:17:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can relate.
00:17:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Single mom.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:17:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
And so I don't think I've ever said, no, you can't take time off or anything like that.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so as a single mom with four kids, sometimes just risk aversion keeps you from talking. Being afraid of stirring the pot a little bit, causing any kind of conflict, causing any kind of work environment hostility. you say things, you know what I mean? don't rock the boat kind of thing, which is why I was asking you, did you feel like it was more of her personality to not be open and say what she's thinking? Or is it that she's a single mom who can't afford to lose her job? and wants to have a good place to work. So she doesn't rock the boat and saying.
00:18:04 - Lorenz Schuerch
think there could be some of that. And I have four kids, so I kind of get it too a little bit, maybe not to the same extent, but, you know, you want stability when you have kids. You're not looking to job hop. So it's abilities, your primary motivator. And so I think there's some of that. I think there's, you know, it's easy to feel when there's not a ton of parents around you. It's easy to feel like you're not sure if people are gonna understand your needs.
00:18:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna make a note of just something that maybe we can work on some exercises that we can at least experiment and see if it's something that we can, we can. help with because I look at this as most of us don't want to be job-hopping. Most of us would like to kind of have a place where we can nurture and grow and evolve ourselves as well as everyone around us for a long time. And if that's the case, then it's worth investing in every portion of that experience in terms of the skills, including the soft skills, the communication skills, including the relationships between the team members, all of those things. so being able to tap into each person's super powers, their strength, everything that they have inside of their minds, to the point of like what you read in multipliers. Pat, did we talk about multipliers last week at all?
00:19:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
you remember? Yeah, I told you I didn't like to read.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. we'll have an approach. But the promise of the book was, and I think I did touch this, which is that you want to nurture the leadership in everybody that's on your team, so that basically everybody's playing at their best levels, and that you can create autonomy. Like you were talking about Cynthia, you needed to walk her through some things so that she would know just to get the job done, right? These are the things that don't sit around and wait to be told that type of thing. Like that's multiplying, that's making her more valuable, and there were things that Lorenz did as well to work with her. So that's just the thing is noticing where somebody might be pulling punches a little bit, might be holding back a little bit, or somebody might just not be having the support that they need to be able to to do what they can do. So as we go through our meetings each week, it's just kind of looking and going, oh, I noticed this thing. And some of it is just going to be human nature. None of us are perfect. None of us are going to do amazing at all the things all the time. But some of the things we can make, even if it's a 1% improvement, a 5% improvement, sometimes a 15% improvement. And then you start compounding 1% over here, 5% here, 10% here, another 1 over here. And then all of these different improvements, of them micro level, some of them macro level. And then you look at that a year later, and you look backwards and go, wow, this is amazing. Look at how steady we are at these numbers. Look at how happy everyone is. Look at how well everyone's working together. I used to have to say this to somebody every single week. now I really don't know. I'm to have to say anything to them about it, like little things like that, that just make the quality of your work day better, a little bit less stressed, not just for you, but for your teammates, which tends to end up coming out for the clients, which makes their experience a little bit better, generally will impact the numbers so that your bottom line revenue is higher without feeling more stressed because of it. So, they're very subtle things. There's nothing that you go, holy cow, that's an amazing whiz-bang like, you know, did that come from? It's nothing like that. It's just a little micro adjustment here and there that you look back at it and go, this is better. For example, around your goal last year to start improving your numbers, how are they compared to where you were at the beginning of 2023 versus now?
00:22:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's that like for you? I've been trying to work on... I'm quicker turnaround. think I had a couple of first quarter. I had a couple of rough months. One was kind of rough because of money in and then the following one was rough because of settlements, which doesn't make sense. You would think it'd be the other way around. that took a big chunk out of my confidence. I kind of like try to reset myself, reset the team expectations and try to press on the gas pedal. The numbers could be my goal every month as a minimum. of $600,000 and I haven't hit that in a couple of months, so I've been just disappointed. And then there's a couple of factors as of looking at that and State Farm has been just really awful to deal with this year. putting the brakes on everything I've got. Probably out of the 20 cases I have in negotiations right now. 10 of them are State Farm and they're offering less than meds. mean, I don't know about you Patrick, but they're just, they seem to be just slowing everything down, just gumming up the words. And it, it's just, it takes so much time.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you noticed anything that sounds out about State Farm for you?
00:24:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Same compliance as like the cases. Those cases take the most time to get resolved and it's like, and it's crappy results. Yeah, like the, to the firm, it's like the lowest result of like, sometimes I'm like, it's better. We don't even just drop the case and I'd rather put more time into X case that's going to bring in 30K to the firm because, I mean, I just resolved one now. It's like the case settled for nine grand. We're going to take like two, like, I spent so many time just trying to reach somebody there. Clients pissed off because it took so long and the numbers like not even anything, you know, you would think somebody was going to wait five months for a case in negotiation would be getting like at least 10 to 12K in their pocket.
00:25:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's to the point where, when I see in the intake channel that the defendant's insurance estate farm, I get anxiety and I'm like, if it's not a broken bone, I don't really want it. Because I know it's just going to be such a struggle.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really. really good to know. don't know ethically that we'll want to avoid those, but maybe, you know, because we talked about client ranking, but maybe there's a case ranking system that we have. And maybe, I don't know, I want to talk and brainstorm this with Mark and see if there's a different way that we handle it. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:26:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Because I look, the main issue and Patrick talked about is it takes just as long to manage a small soft tissue case as, you know, for a state farm as it does to manage something a little bit more serious for GEICO, for example. But the state farm case, I know if I get the meds, it's like party time, we've we've won kind of thing where with GEICO, we can pop the policies
00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All day long It's also hard to game plan those state farm cases because even if you do all the right things like that mark has taught us on how to work up a case It like that just doesn't apply what state farm for some reason. I know the friends has cases where you know even The client got injections in the medical You know the offers like not even half the medical expenses like it just doesn't make sense And that's a case that you work up just like any other case would and you know The other one settles and gets done and this one you're still stuck like asking the most basic questions to the adjuster like why is your offer X amount and you get like Seven eight of the state farm cases now You know based on marks the stuff he sees this case It doesn't have any negotiations for X amount of months. The client's pissed off. It just snowballed into the time sucking machine. And then when it does get resolved, it's not even worth half the time that we spent on it. But to completely bar every state farm case from coming into the firm, I don't know if that's the right move.
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think it would be practical. We can't lose that many, but we might be able to change the way that we process them. And I don't know, like, even maybe a team or a system dedicated to it, or just even just having an awareness. There sometimes there might be a conversation that Mark can have. Maybe there's a representative. I don't know, but...
00:29:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It starts with having awareness.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has there even been a conversation among the attorney is or with Mark that state farm stands out so badly?
00:29:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, every week, every week.
00:29:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
I can bring it up every week.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does he say about it?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
He says, well, it's you know, you can always have someone else second voice and things like that. I've had other people second voices. had Patrick second voice. I've had Sam, I've had Nick. And usually it results in an additional thousand bucks. And it's I'm not going to like bulk at that because I know if we get enough extra thousand dollars eventually builds up or whatever. So go ahead, sorry. And I feel like. Like where's my value as an attorney to the client?
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
If I'm getting them. the meds paid for, basically.
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, at the very least, one thing I wanna do, and I don't think it's in our, I don't know if it's in our reports, it's not on my dashboard, but I would like to see matters by insurance companies and look at what the volume is across insurance companies in terms of how many cases we get how many times we hit max policy limits. Just drill down on that a little bit more. We'll be interesting. And sometimes, so to the point of getting disheartened, sometimes you just have to put things in perspective and just say, is it, and not let it get to you. pause, you know, there's there's all kinds of science on the psychology when you just you focus on on the problems, especially the things that you can't control, it impacts the rest of your mood, it impacts your energy, it's going to impact your cognitive abilities, simply because your mind is over here wrestling the frustration.
00:31:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, but the metric that we're measured by is our average fee.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, I get that and so but here so so this is part of why I want to have the report so I can look at statistically if everybody is averaging roughly the same amount of state farm cases so then we would look at is there any possible way and I doubt it that somehow intake is you know one team gets more of that and one team doesn't it's not very likely that that's the case. So that means that if everybody's getting right roughly, and throughout the year, it probably is. The same amount of state farm cases, then it really is not a determining factor, right? Because you would all be dealing with the same problem. And so, if Samantha, so I'm looking, I asked Mark this and I did not get the question, but you guys get to see each other's numbers, right? You know what everybody's attorney fees are, roughly. so I'm going to look at this for this year. Let me update it. So, Lorenz, for the year of 2024, your average attorney fee is 11,000. We're not going to look at Mark or Nick, because obvious reasons. Pat, you're at 8.8k, Sam's at 17k, Tyler's at 11k. So, you and Tyler are tied Lorenz. If I look at that for last month for June, which is a very small pool and not really a good way to look at it, for last month your 8.4k, Sam was 12k, Tyler was 9.3k, Pat, your 7.6k. A month is, I mean, it's not a good sample size because of how long your cases take to work up and to settle. And let me look at record counts. So, wait, that was last month. wanted to do this for the year. So, cases closed by team for this year. Lorenz 125 for you. Pat, you're at 59. is a 120, so learns you close more cases. Again, how long they start is not necessarily a good thing. Just a second, please. have a child. Teenagers, and I work from home, so like, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Okay, so, click cases close by team. Lorenz, 125, is for 2024, Pat, 59, 120, then, that number's 100% not correct, gross the, oh, that's by state, I'm fine. Resolution by team. My average attorney, we already did that. Dropouts and subouts. Lorenz, your percentage of subouts. Let's see, subouts as they fired you or is that dropped out?
00:35:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, subout is when they hired different attorneys.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
difference I guess. So, your percentage is rough. That can't be right. Hold on. Let me make sure this year. I'm not positive. Okay, okay. I need to change this report because I want to see it per all the cases that you have. But for the year, you only had five subouts. Samantha had 13. Pat had... three. Tyler had seven. Now, there's a lot of reasons that can happen. It can be your performance. It could be the insurance. It could be multiple things. And they're blaming us for it, not necessarily because of something you and your team have done. But there's a lot of things to look at in terms of your quality and performance and how you do the job. It isn't just attorney fees. That is what your incentive pay is. But all of these things impact sweet lot. Getting subbed out. And I can't so one on sub out. And one out. Percentage for cases. And policy limit for that case, potential loss, because I think that we should be measuring the loss for team two. And then this isn't about penalizing anyone. It's about making sure that we're evaluating everything. So, let's say that your attorney fees are lower, first of all, you're operating primarily in Arizona, and I don't know. All of you are, so Samantha waved into, I don't remember New Mexico, I think she's New Mexico. Who's doing Texas, do you remember? Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. So, you know, there's different things impacting your numbers, and all of that needs to be taken into account. So, at the end of the day, Really, the thing is we want to look at each of those numbers, just your attorney fees, but we want to look at the sub-out rate. We want to look at policy limits. We want to look at how often is your team showing up and doing well, how happy are they because that has an impact on the likelihood that we're going to have to replace somebody soon. We have to replace somebody because the pod leader, the attorney, is burning people out. It's very difficult to find good people to hire. We are constantly looking and we go through a lot just to find one new attorney. So, again, my approach is holistic. I'm looking at everything in Sweetlock top to bottom, never just the bottom line. I'm looking at each individual, I'm looking at them as a person. I'm looking at all the costs, all the impact. act, all the wins, all the losses, and and how it affects everything because ultimately each of these things makes an impact on how profitable it is, including how happy everybody is. So if you learn to measure all the things that matter, not just your attorney fees, but like I think you should be happy with the fact that your subout rate is so low, I think that that's important. I think that that means that you're probably doing something good. However, what I don't have and what I need and why I need to change this report is I don't have that in relationship to how many cases you had this year. So Samantha, if she, so her subout rate is more than double yours, but if her case rate is more than double yours, then she's roughly in the same boat, you know what I but. Yeah, so anyway, those are some of the things to look at, Pat, you're coming up and now you've got those goals, trying to, so I'm just going to tell you Lorenz, Pat's gone in for being the best attorney in the firm, so we've got some competition in here, but I think it's good, I think it's good. I think how we handle the competition, like Samantha, she's leading in attorney fees, but when Pat asks her questions, she answers them, and thoroughly, really supportive in answering that. And so ultimately, if all of our goal is, how do we make the sweet law be the best place to work, the best place to go for help? Well, you know, I think that's winning, right? job security is, if you show up and you're continually improving, maybe you're not improving an attorney fees for... or three months. But maybe what you did was improve your team processes. You improved. You made sweet lot better. And that's important. So we're going to have those conversations too. And also going to take that and report back to Mark, like the fact that you figured out through multiple iterations and different processes and effort and communicating with your team that your trajectory improved because you split the teams instead of having people sitting around, wasting their time on meetings that are irrelevant to them, doing bio reviews per your groups. That's important. Sweet lot was improved because of that effort. So maybe it doesn't have an immediate impact on the attorney fees, but it will over time, 100%. There's no way that's not going to. And if we get to continue working together, so here's the other thing.
00:41:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Q1 here. Yeah, I guess I might. I am competitive, but I'm more competitive with myself, so always compared to myself to one career.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's best way to be, honestly, because that's the only race you can run, but I like both of them. I think ultimately that's the only race you can control and that you're really actually in, but with Pat, know, wanting to get the highest numbers, like I get that too. The bottom line is whatever motivates us, that's what we need to tap into. That's what we need to be working with. So what everybody has different drivers, and as long as there's intrinsic motivation and drive, that's all we need. There are people that don't have it. They're only externally motivated to please other people, to get accolades, to earn money, but mostly so they can show up things, not because they want to improve themselves, not because they actually want to be the best at anything they just want to be. he perceived as the best. Pat wants to be good at what he does. You want to be good at what you do. And that's valuable. But I want to make sure that you did hear me. All of Sweet Law is slow and Q1.
00:43:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Did you know that? No.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every year, I've watched it. Every year, every year, have a little bit of a freakout period. Mark has a little bit of a freakout period. And then everything turns around and we're like, oh yeah, this is a pattern. But I will tell you that Mark didn't know it was a pattern because Mark didn't track his numbers. And when I would ask him for his numbers, he would say, well, I think it's this. And I think it's that. And I said, none of what you say adds up. So how about we go get that information? Yeah, but it's a pain in the . don't know how to get it.
00:43:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
And like, well, let's figure that out, Mark.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we did. And so now we've got some data and the more that we dig into it. Um, so we'll go get some information and all of a sudden, you know, nothing's really happening and then Mark sends an email because he can't sleep a night because he was thinking about something and he had an epiphany and he dug into some numbers and he's like, I just realized this. And then we have a big change and there's a big improvement and so really digging into all of these different numbers makes a difference. But something that I really love about numbers is it kind of takes the emotions out of it and in a good way. Um, because you see what's real numbers don't lie. Numbers tell you the truth. So if you see some good numbers, what do you know? You know that that's, that's a real thing. That's a good thing. If you see a number you don't like, it's also a real thing, but that's an opportunity to improve. And iteration upon iteration changes happen and occur. So, that's what we're looking at. So one thing I'm really excited about though by talking to you guys as I'm realizing how we can improve our reporting which is going to be really useful for us and what we're doing with Mark which will somehow come back and improve things for you including potentially improve because I don't know that we have the best incentive program that there is I want to make sure that you guys are incentivized for all the good work that you do including if we're minimizing dropouts and subouts I think that that should be part of it. Especially if the reason that we're getting subbed out is lack of communication and so this was something that really isn't managed super well I think across any team. I think it's getting better but we would have some cases where nobody been communicated with for two and a half months which is not acceptable and until I I was asking questions and probing and digging into that. That was just like that and it was unknown. So there's always opportunity to improve. And just by having the conversations, we figure out ways to, because you guys have a lot of watch, you have a lot of things to manage, you have a lot of people, a lot of processes, a lot of conversations that will fry the average person's brain every day. So dropping the ball is kind of part of the job, it's going to happen. we're trying to do is create the systems that minimize ball dropping. know what I mean? That also maximize making sure that we're spending the most time on the most important things, the highest leveraged impact type thing. And that we're making air pre-person on the team as potent as possible so that everybody's winning. So, um, okay, we've got about 15 minutes left and then Lorenz, um, before I forget, let's just go ahead and get out next week's schedule because next week will be just you and me.
00:47:21 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I thought we said next Wednesday, same time.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did we? Okay, uh, that will work. Let me just, I think I just didn't schedule it yet. Let me duplicate this. What is the calendar? No, that's not it. That will work. That will work. You don't have to deal with All right. Okay, so that's done. So Pat, Mr. Patrick, um, have you had any thoughts since our conversation last week?
00:48:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
The main thing that stood out was like the male, female dynamic. Um, it was obviously two of my team members or females. Um, we kind of touched on like how the male dynamic can help them like a camera with what you said. But like, I remember you talked about the dynamic between male and female team. Um, I want to see how I can use that to maximize. Um, because the team is super respectful. Um, you know, we don't have any issues. Sometimes I feel like there might be issues with the female case manager and answering to a male attorney, I'm not sure why, but that was like the main thing that really stood out. So I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on like naturally what's the dynamic like.
00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just even observing dynamics between people, there are going to be different things, the female female dynamic, especially if they're super strong, A type personalities in the workforce can be very either they're going to be very supportive of each other or tear each other apart. There's not a lot of middle ground generally speaking. So the first thing is just observing what kind of dynamics exist. Who do do two people interact with each other and seem to be more open when they interact with each other versus interacting with other people? Do you notice any tension? Do you notice more forthcoming, more holding back? type of thing. What I was saying about you is that you have a, so the way that you approach Cynthia, I think Lorenz is the same type of way, is that he wants to bring out the best in people. You want to support them. That doesn't exist everywhere with every person. Not every female comes to work and feels safe, either because of anybody that work or one. And men of the, you know, not necessarily safe, but it impacts, it'll show up in a woman a little bit differently in terms of how much she will lead and share what she knows is gonna help things. So one of the things that I do and have done for several CEOs is higher higher. and install a right hand person for them, more than an assistant, somebody who kind of like pushes back on them a little bit and says, did you think about this? Hey, I noticed you said you were going to do this, but you're not doing this. That type of thing, right? Now, that was what they were hired for. That was their exact role. That was what was wanted from the CEO, somebody to push back little bit and hold them accountable because there's nobody doing that in the business. And we all need somebody to hold us accountable. But without fail, even though that person was told clearly, please call out when you see issues, please call that out every single time as often as possible. And even when they did that and they never got pushed back, even when they were fully respected every time, it took years for them to feel safe enough to do the job well. Because generally speaking, That's not how the rest of the world operates. Most people don't want to be how accountable. Most people don't want to be called out even respectfully. There's ego involved, right? You both come off to me as someone who is not operating from a you're coming off a little harsh or something like that. But more importantly, the energy that comes from that is that you're safe to be around. You care about the people that work for you and work with you. Here's how I knew that from you, Pat. Without being prompted, you were talking about how you noticed Cynthia was not doing X, Y, don't remember all the details of it, but I remember you're like, I tried to give her space so that she could just do her thing and not, you know, control her basically. But you noticed that. that wasn't working. And so you knew that she needed more support, she needed guidance, she needed to be directed. And so you did that. But what you told me was I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I didn't want to, you know, cause her any problems or make her uncomfortable. So I just took my time and this is the approach that I took. So you showed that you were concerned with how she felt and that you took the time to modify the way that you showed up in order to create a safe space for her. I'm going to tell you, and Lorenz, I think that you would do the same kind of thing. I think that that's how you operate primarily is being concerned with giving people what they want. And you've given other signals like that, same thing with Cynthia, noticing that she's process oriented and everybody else is kind of free. so you gave her some tasks to allow her to create those processes. also when your team told you, look, we don't like wasting our time, like, okay, let's make a modification split this and I'll just go ahead and do two file reviews even though maybe it's more tedious for you, you were there to lead your people the way that they wanted to be led. What I'm trying to explain to you guys and what I really want you to hear, and this is not a platitude or patronizing or anything, that is not how most leaders operate. Most people are more bosses, they're not leaders. You both show up as leaders because you care about how the people that work for you feel you want them to be happy and successful and even if it's not altruistic, even if the only reason you're doing that was because then they'll perform better for you and you get better paid. Let's say that was all it was and I know that it's not. It still gets the same end result, they're still taking care of. So paying attention to how people respond to you. I'm noticing, for example, if Viri doesn't maybe answer questions if you ask her how things are going. want to drill into that with you next week a little bit more Lorenz and get the details so that maybe I can kind of figure out what's going on a little bit and we can find a way for that. But generally speaking, that's going to be that she's received signals from other bosses or leaders that have said, you know, if you tell me too much, it's going to annoy me and I'm going to give you some annoyed energy and you're going to feel that tension and that hostility and she has taken that and gone, you know what, I'm going show up, I'm going do my job, I'm going to go home and that's it. And I'm not going to rock the boat because I don't want to deal with feeling threatened with my job or anything like that. So, um, paying attention to these types of things, being aware of them, and also paying So guys, what I want you to understand is knowing how unique you are, that you have an opportunity to really improve, especially when you have females working on your team. Because you are safe, because you do care, you can probably get better performance out of them than they've ever had before. But if you want to know the impact that it makes, and maybe this doesn't motivate you, but I'll tell you this anyway, you can help them show up better in the rest of their lives completely by showing them that there are safe people in the world where they can make mistakes, they can say the wrong thing, and they can still be okay. You know what I mean? Because if you have people willing to make mistakes out loud, then the mistakes can be seen in the open, which means they can be corrected gently, but they can be corrected. Whereas if you have people who feel like they need to cover up their mistakes. Who need to lie about them or just not show you, you know, what's weak within them? You can't correct it. You can't improve it. Does does any of this make sense? Yeah, absolutely so I'll give you an example of where I learned and then we can kind of close it and I was inquire for like ever and and We would be learning new songs and they were difficult songs and my my Quaritage was always trying to get us to sing louder and So he could hear so he could pick out the part so he could see like he's I could hear there's an off note But I don't know where it's coming from because every time I walk by everybody's mumbling and they're not really right So I'm just like, you know what I'm sure you can imagine I was loud I Don't do quite or settle very well, but um, so I did that and it was frustrating because I would get corrected but I would get corrected quick and you know what happened after that, I nailed the part and then I'd be a section leader and everybody would start listening to me. So when I would join in any other choirs, church choirs, whatever adult activities and every other thing, I'll just be loud. I'll just make my mistakes out loud. I have opinions, I'm very secure in my opinions and loud about them when I say them and confident in them, knowing that if I'm wrong, somebody's going to correct me and I will not like that, by the way, do not like being corrected. But I prefer being corrected to being wrong perpetually. Do you know what I mean? So I'm okay with being confidently wrong so that somebody who knows better can observe it and go, yeah, no, that's not right, Tina. This is actually what you need to do. So I try to create that kind of space for people that work with me. as well and encourage them, just go do things. If you make a mistake, we're going to figure it out together. But if I don't have to tell you and train you on every little thing because you're not afraid to try it, you're not afraid to problem solve, you're not afraid to explore, you're not afraid to go look for other solutions and implement them knowing it could cost us money, it could cost us time. But knowing that the end result is we're going to get more knowledge and we're going to have a deeper understanding of how these things work and you got it for yourself and you made yourself more valuable to me. But I'm paying you the same amount of money. Go learn, go explore, go figure some things out. But then when they do that, they start getting more brave and they want to explore more things and they want to try more things and they bring more things to the table and then they stay with me for years and I get to keep benefiting from this all because I was like, go ahead and make mistakes. Like it's powerful. But, you have to make it very clear that it's a safe place to make mistakes. It's a safe place to tell what you really think, as long as it's done respectfully. And if it's done disrespectfully, then you just correct it respectfully. But we're looking at this long term, your people evolving. And the other thing that I'll tell you is that these skills and these things, they'll help you as parents, if you're a coach, they'll help you as a friend, any other place you show up as a leader. When you learn how to create a safe space for people, but also help them be their most powerful selves, everything that you do, everywhere that you serve, everywhere that you show up and have any kind of interactions, improves because you will be one of the few places in the world where somebody is safe to show up and have some room to make mistakes. So that they can explore and. and learn. And it's, I think it's pretty awesome. I mean, I love watching people grow. love knowing that I had a little bit of a part of it. And the two of you have both demonstrated that you have that kind of interest and awareness and ability. And Pat, you've got a strong like shoulder spore things just kind of roll off you. Lorenz, I think you get a little bit more anxious and stressed out about it, but you still take it into you rather than putting it on them. And so, and if we can teach you how to let stuff roll off you a little bit better, that would be good. But at the end of the day, you both offer very unique things to your teams where there's a lot of potential and growth. And I think that Sweet Law is going to be, I think Sweet Law is blessed for having both of you. But if we can keep working on these things together, I'm looking at some awesome stuff coming down the road.
01:02:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
and some good numbers and of course you know you want to get that extra money and you've got those goals so we'll get to them too through the people that you're working with and just through day-to-day ops so um Pat before we wrap up so we were talking about dynamics beyond female dynamic and you said that's what you were thinking about do you have more questions do you have more thoughts like did you want to dig into that a little bit more now um i had another can i give you like another thing i was thinking yeah um how to keep them motivated because obviously like their cap on you know financial like improvement is kind of limited because just the nature like we have our licenses and we're attorneys and like your salary or whatever can just you know it's kind of like sky's the limit whereas with you you know, non-licens staff here, it's kind of like, there's kind of a ceiling, um, and I'm sure they know that, but they, which is why I applaud and I appreciate all the work that they do, because I mean, Lorenz and I was like, they take a big blunt of the work that we don't want to do, you know, just even taking the calls every day, it's like, one day if Elsie's not here, and like, it kind of falls back on me, it's like, pay this woman what she needs to be paid to be happy and keep her here as long as possible, because like, you know, they really do a lot of the work that, you know, as an attorney at some point you want to negotiate and get the settlements, which is the fun part. So just like trying to keep them motivated and happy to be coming to work every day, because like I said, they do a lot of the work and, you know, I don't know how much they make, but in obviously Lorenz and I have like the room to really grow whereas other staff members is kind of like a range because for me it was in that position like I don't know if I would have lasted as long as, know, people have doing the work that they do.
01:04:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
So what I've done with my team is I've made my growth commence written affairs so we have certain bonus ladders where if we bring in this much money that month I'll take money out of my paycheck to bonus the people that and then that way they feel just as invested in the success as I do.
01:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. But I thought that that was that the incentive program, so I guess maybe I was just probably thinking about intake because I know intake. takes incentive is combined like there's no way to separate it because each of them can touch a case multiple times before it becomes a case and before it's turned over to you because I've been trying to figure out how do I create some separation so that we can really measure and reward according to effort because not everybody shows up the same and I think that it should be based off of effort and ability but I didn't realize that the pods were separate like that that the case managers and assistants don't get incentive pay is that correct like not unless you're too mean right so that's some questions that I have because I would like to see that be consistent across sweet law I think that that would be better for the company but we've not had this conversation would like to have that with Mark. So that was a good point, Pat.
01:06:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
will bring that up.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My staff hasn't complained about, hey, this is just something internally that I was. No, yeah, yeah. That's good. I'm glad you brought that up and I'm glad you're thinking about that because I would think the same thing. know, if you're incentivized and they're not like, there's obviously ceiling to how much you can ask for them when they don't get more for it. I, for sure, I'm motivated by incentives and if I'm not getting more for working harder, guess what I'm not going to do.
01:06:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like, don't go put that up for somewhere else that comes back. the end of the day, was not going to want to get paid more, know, but there's just one of those things I was thinking about because, you know, on those hard days, when you, you know, on by clients all days, it's like, I'm going to come to work the next day and then, you know, what's my financial future like, you know, whereas for me and Lorenz, you know, we can suck it up and, you know, get yelled at by clients, but you have a really good month and it's like, You know, this is why why I put up, you know, yeah, so just you know I want to make sure that For the long term the team is happy and you know despite their They've been like in certain range. They can have other things to look forward to and be happy about Well, that's like a couple hundred dollars incentive every month.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know it's not very much that takes to Yeah People yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so that's good was there anything else?
01:07:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I didn't answer that I've been to look into that I don't think so I think the The three of us on the calls would be helpful because I can get some more detail on how Lorenz you know organizers team and everything because I'm just free styling I see some stuff that Sam does Tyler does from Lorenz But obviously these are more in-depth calls so No, I'm excited.
01:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm glad and I'm really glad that you said that because I wasn't sure how I want to structure this. I thought that one on one a month and then to all of us meetings a month would be best. So I think that that would be good. Still that way we can talk about your team specifically on an individual basis. So that's what the one on one call would be to really dive into the nuances of your specific people. And then twice a month, you could really just do some back and forth best practices digging into Sweet Long General.
01:08:36 - Lorenz Schuerch
So how do you feel about that Lorenz? Does that work for you? That's great. I'm always, I always want to grow. I always want to do better. So I'm happy to just follow your lead and hopefully settle off. A lot more cases and have happy teams.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I think, I mean, just the thing that you did with the file review, I'm really looking forward to seeing how that goes. Pat, your team is going to be growing eventually. mean, you're definitely gun, and I'm watching your line grow. So it's good. I think you guys are awesome. I'm so excited to be doing this. Thank you for spending some time with me and letting me come in and do this work with you guys. So Lorenz, I will meet with you next week. And then Pat and Lorenz will will reconvene, not next Wednesday, but the Monday after that at 3 p.m. Sounds good.
01:09:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You send emails, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every time like we're about to have a meeting? Yeah, you should get a notification through Google. And I have it set by default to send multiple reminders. But I don't know that the multiple reminders go to you. So, starting a day or yesterday. So what I'll tell you. though is so in the beginning we didn't have a set time but we're going to so what you can do is once I set that recurring Monday meeting call which I'll do by next week at the latest because we're doing Wednesday next week what you can do is go into your calendar and set up your own reminders to be whatever frequency level you want but I have mine going one day before just to kind of remind me it's a thing I do with all of my meetings and then four hours before and 15 minutes before just so that I remember because I've got a lot going on so I need other reminders but if you need anything else if you want other kinds of reminders let me know I probably will start getting to some point where there's some follow-up questions that I'll ask through email just to make sure that we're on track but right now there's a lot of just downloading everything from you guys so we're not getting to that point yet uh yeah so any other questions did you fix your pool my daughter is working on it right now because i just work hard yang are you in california no i'm in northern southern cal southern organ i want to say northern california southern organ southern yeah look now why is it more again oh we're at beaverton oh that's much nicer i live in the hictown and i cannot wait to move i'll be moving though every single night because i like oh we're at um probably the scott still area it's either that or vegas but yeah stop still it's very nice yes i like it very much all right you guys well i hope you have an amazing fourth of july i hope you have a great weekend and i look for

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sounds fantastic, actually. I normally would make that with the leftover turkey, but we also have mashed potatoes and stuffing left, so we're just having a repeat tonight. But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red. I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

I'm just looking at my bathroom no highlights and they are so weird because they're a I yeah but like one of them is NHH semi colon period KKKG you know you don't remember that for four minutes you didn't you did not get that done yet my bad my one that one was super important I was crazy it was so important I had to be in my top secret code okay I forgot my decoder mean right wonder twin powers cannot activate yeah and then the other lovely benefit is that I'm pretty sure I didn't save notes again because I don't have notes from last week and I'm on my laptop not my desktop so it's okay But, we've been on the same kind of thread for a while anyway, which is just talking about another 71, the things that you're doing because I want to poke and prod into that. You were, I think you had figured out the cost per acquisition was, I wrote down $17, but I feel like that was not the right number, that it was like 20.
00:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think I mean, no, it's, it's around there, I think I had an initial number and then I revised it. Okay. Because I found something more at times, I think it was initially 14 or something. But it's in that neighborhood.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and we were talking about getting reliable data. And so, has there been any movement towards that?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I did figure out. I did figure out that the GA4 is working. Those changes that I made are actually now populating variation data. In there, it just isn't part of the default reporting. You have to go create a report to see it. like, oh, and I don't know how to, this goes to the Mercer thing. I don't know how to get a widget to show up. I figured, I ran the report and it was there and I go, the data's here. Granted, I didn't really try to figure it out. just was like, oh, the data's here. It is registering. Check. don't need to go back to funnel kit. I just need to now go learn how to build either custom reports or see if they like. This should be so great when other people could build reports. That's.
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you could go the Dan does it route or you could let me introduce you to win.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah, you can do that because now I know the day is in there. The problem before was I didn't think it was in there. It was in there.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I met a bar, like thing in the kitchen here and the stool is really uncomfortable. It's just all I miss my desk. I miss my story. But I love the 113 degree weather. Is really though? Oh, yeah, it is and I really love it.
00:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I go outside like every hour.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I did not love it, but love it. I love it. I hate the cold. It makes me want to keep people. Okay, let's see. All right, so let me just, how do I want to do this? I need to set a reminder for myself to introduce you to win, so let me do that. I want to think about it more than just pop up an email right now because yeah, that will be good. I'm really interested to see just like if you could just have a conversation with him what that would yield. just, like I've said before and I want to, you know, waste time repeating it, but I do think. think that there's um you would just really enjoy him as a person and his brain but also what he knows and you would want to plug into that because like he's just really good at understanding all of it. I think he probably is smarter than Mercer.
00:05:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No sir.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah okay so let me go back and look at this one oh okay so I'm framing the question hold on we still need the data basically I'm thinking about the the um well so now I can turn to like segmenters and go all right that's going to be my first step do I think do I trust what's in there and what what is it showing me
00:06:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know, but now I can go over it a bit. Well, yeah, and I also need to figure out like where, I don't know if it pulls sales data from Blue or it does from Blue for sure, but well, I guess I determined that when I make a report. So I would use Blue data. The other bit was, yeah, when I just need to figure out I need to be adding any additional info. OK.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, it is not just my other computer.
00:06:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Your guard. I live really just walked away from my phone. My phone don't. But you just disappeared like, come on. I just got to remember where I left it. Okay, we're back, we're back, we're yes, who's back, that good game. Yeah, so I just need to now go poke around and figure out. I did poke around and met her and saw my phone and stuff, and there was interesting, but nothing crazy. Okay, and we're waiting for, what's today's day, today's the 20th, so this whole, like this weird thing that's in the 20th, we have to wait, I was like, okay, and then the week after the 25th, we'll know if things are normal, oh no we won't. because that'll be Fourth of July and sales are gonna go down.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
00:08:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have to wait for a week after that and then we'll know. There's constantly like these weird interruptions, so that's gonna be in another one. We're like averaging 40 sales a Nice. Which was my target. And I started running more ads anyway.
00:08:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember when it was like 35 or 31 or something and then 35 now.
00:08:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It was like 51 at the beginning of the month. But now I think it sounds like between 39 and 40.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I mean the target.
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, 31.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it was 31. Yeah.
00:08:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've actually never reset it because then we fell off it. we're trying to get back to it.
00:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you done the math to figure out um how many daily subscriptions would get you to the 1% market share increase?
00:09:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't remember doing that math. So here's the thing that I figured out and I kind of want to hit this guy up and be like well that was wrong. Just see what his reaction is. He's like the subscription guru expert. I ran his formula. His formula is incorrect. So his formula said hey you'll cap out and let's say it's 3600. We're 300 over that. Like dude that's a pretty big wrong. Like if it was you know 3625 or you know within 100 but if it's 300 off I'm like that's way too big enough and we keep going up.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait it's just getting more wrong.
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm confused So forever I was looking for What I was calling like In weirdly, this is actually his language which I thought was really funny that The the proverbial glass ceiling like at some point The math is going to be that like no you're going to reach a Level of stasis, right? how do I figure that out? So for years, I never could find anything like I've found all kinds of other formulas around stasis and whatnot and Subscriptions and then there's this dude Robert Scrobe who I stumbled on to maybe two years ago and He has this formula. Hey, this is the the glass ceiling formula or the subscription ceiling point or whatever and And I had not forgotten about it, but I was just not using it because we were in the doldrums, but when I realized, you know, month ago, that, oh, wait a minute, I rediscovered it. And I threw it in a spreadsheet with some other , like data. And then I ran it. I was like, Oh, okay, well, we're averaging whatever 31 today, whatever the number was, right? So the formula is how many new subscriptions who were adding a day. And then you factor in your churn. So I actually used a churn that I would say is, this could be actually not a lot of this could be the reason. Our churn was falsely inflated. Really? So what I should do is go back in and reduce our historical churn. I would say is 21 2021. churn as a result of 2023 had crept up to 25, but it's really not real. So if that's not real and I revise that down to 21, I'll bet it gets closer. Then the question would be, do we go past that? But using the data on hand, it was like, you're going to be, you're done at 3,600. we already surpassed that.
00:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wow. Which, thanks to Mass, tells us something's wrong, so it has to be the churn. The only thing that can be wrong. Good work, Tina. Literally never thought of that before.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, oh, wait a minute. Isn't it funny how I really, I mean, I do some work, some of the actual calculations, formatting, some setting up, some things, but so much of it is just unlocking you by asking the question. didn't ask yourself, or you asked yourself, but you didn't make yourself answer.
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I wasn't even I wasn't even asking myself that I was just sort of whatever. Yes, exactly.
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that is the whole point.
00:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's right. It's like You I can't it's that. I mean, that's why I go solve other people's puzzles.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:13:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It makes me ask questions.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wouldn't normally ask. And that's what I needed to I'm on the hunt for finding that person for me now because I really do want to build a scalable thing. Okay, for just just like two seconds. So Maria, Maria had that offer. So it's just how people do what they do what they're good at what they're not good at what. So she's really good at selling, but not so great at the follow up because I bought that and the follow up email, which she actually does a really good job of that. She must have an amazing Send her score because she's always about that hit that reply and say Yahoo, blah, blah, but um, so I bought it and it says, okay, and I'm creating a calendar for you, which was a default. all to everybody who bought it, right? To schedule your four hour VIP day. That was over a week ago. And there's been no further emails, no further follow up. So if I'm a person, now I'm just chill about it cause I know something about her and I've talked to her and I know you, but if I was a brand new customer, now I got ghosted for a week after spending $2,000 for somebody, I'd be like, what is going on here?
00:14:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And my first thought is something's broken.
00:14:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and what I think though, also with the lack of communication with her is either somehow I pissed her off and she doesn't like me or, and I think that this is the bigger thing is she sells and can't fulfill really well, like she's overstretched.
00:14:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think that's definitely part of it. I was gonna say that her and I's interactions like we have one, one hour call or whatever or two hour call. And then she banged out some coffee and then I banged on the coffee and then I never talked to her again I just would text her, but you know me like I Prefer not to talk to people right and then I could get it done via text and we communicated in the doc, but I Was like most people wouldn't go for this I'm not most people right so I was like, I don't know so it listens to you right now. I go well Yeah, think that is kind of the way she rolls I think I think she has this a bit I would say probably a bit of a scarcity mindset That's why she's always making offers Yeah And that's the thing that's why she's She gets Games right it seems like when I think when I was talking to her she had just she just lost the gig right so she's doing these sort of Fractal blah blah blah see I'm all over the hill you want to call it and then those come and go right so it's like when they go and you're making five grand off of one big hit and then all of a sudden she's hustling doing offers like what you got like I did not wait yeah I was the VIP they went did you I suppose you didn't get the father's day offer or didn't know no because you know what good for her good for her good list segmenting yeah no I did get the father's day offer oh you did bad list segmenting and it is well it's not really though because at discount as a discount no it's funny that she that I'm even on that list it's like girl why are you sending me a 27 dollar office like yeah now that that whole segmenting um yeah and
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The whole thing is like, I don't think I'd want my higher end clients to be getting like that.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I literally was expecting a higher price.
00:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
funny.
00:17:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I, when I clicked her, was like, really, you're like, this is, you're sending me up your entry level offer.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what are you doing? she's had somebody dub her like the low ticket queen or something like that, low offer queen. And so I feel like she's just kind of leaning into that, which actually the time from the things that I'm seeing in the market, that's the trend and, yes, again, but I think that the difference is that because buyers are so much more savvy, they now want to sample and where it used to be a tried and true, those that pay the least expect the most. I'm watching that those that pay the most have been burned so much by just handing over money to salespeople that they're like, where's your proof dude?
00:18:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you're not getting my money until I get referrals and all the money you say that I agree.
00:18:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I've seen a bit of that lately, too. Yeah, where it used to be like, you know, just somebody make a recommendation or whatever, here's $50,000. And now, yeah, it's just, there's definitely a shift in it. Because of that, though, it's even more imperative to do testing and not make assumptions. But I've always leaned more towards the low to high ascension anyway. I feel like if somebody wants to refund at a low level, whatever, it causes you some merchanting issue. But I think that it's really easy to over-deliver on that and kind of negate it. But if somebody buys three different things from you ascending up and then they want to refund, it's pretty clearly that it's them, not you. So I feel like just, the standard operating for business and this might be relative to what you're doing with the music stuff because you do have an ascension I think potential there that having something super low ticket next to like under ten dollars then twenty thirty dollars then what I saw her conversion rate was crazy because she showed me some of the back end stuff so when she tried front end at twenty dollars the conversion rate was like five percent same exact thing at three dollars the conversion rate was seventy five percent but this was what was crazy the conversion rate for the twenty five dollar offer same thing after that so as an upsell was fifty five percent to the cold traffic compared to three percent to cold traffic when it was the front end So now that's just one thing once, right? it's definitely can't be a standard for all things. But it was really interesting how much that. And then the conversion rate to a $2,000 after that was like 15%. So for cold traffic, that was still really solid conversion rates. Anyway, just lots to be thinking about. But it doesn't matter if you're going to ruin your reputation by not fulfilling stuff. That gets bad really fast. Anyway, fascinating. so the original question was, what's the matter for subscriptions in relationship to obtaining a 1% market share? You went to, there was this ceiling, this map that this guy had this formula. So you're going to revisit it to come back with that answer, right?
00:20:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done that calculation. So that's like the sort of gold that I laid out was that, but the problem is based, like, you know, me do it. I have to revisit the 1%. So the 1% calculation I did before is now incorrect because as part of my recent five, our, this is the thing, this sucks, all these eppin changes that they made. I'm like, don't know if I can trust this. So there's two ways I can go about this. I can take the 1% calculation that I did before, which is old data and use that because that data while old or three ways I could do this. I could go revisit that calculation and then, oh, , no, I can't, I can't go. I don't think I could go back and use like 2018, 2018, So that's like the sort of gold that I laid out was that, but the problem is based, like, you know, me do it. I have to revisit the 1%.

00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could go revisit that calculation and then, oh, , no, I can't, I can't go. I don't think I could go back and use like 2018, 2018, 19. So I was like, Oh, just use pre COVID.
00:23:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, all the numbers are F. I guess the best case scenario was would be revisited, do a lifetime calculation that accounts for everything and changes global pandemic. Right. Huge screw up somewhere in the fall of whatever the hell you hear that was. Well, actually, no, that would be in it. So it'll be whatever has happened with a ninja. I just do it in ninja. I don't do another 71. I just, that's all crash data. I just don't use it. But when I recently did, I revisited the lifetime value, it was way higher. And I was like, Oh, , that's way higher, like, over $100 higher.
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that then changes. I guess that doesn't actually change the 1%.
00:23:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That just changes the value of the one person. Right. You're right. Right.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There has to be fixed based off of
00:24:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of how many people are in the market, not how valuable they are to you.
00:24:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So the problem with 1% is we're already exceeding that. The rate at which we are right now is way above 1%.
00:24:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, I can't increase 1% when I'm increased over that already. Like, I don't know where we're going to land to say, okay, this is our actual average. And then I want increase that 1%. When I was trying to increase 1% from 31, well, it's already done. We're 10% about that.
00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, okay, well, we can't really increase 1% and I've increased 10. But I'm not even sure I've increased 10.
00:24:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wait a minute. Okay.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just keep clear here though, because are you talking about a 1% increase in your business with your target? Because I thought you were trying to get 1% more of the market. Oh, yeah, good point.
00:24:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I need to.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what I'm a. So that goes back to how many buyers does that equate to because that should be relatively easy map If you knew what the market size was by a number which you'd have to know if you know what your percent Yeah, that's whatever whatever spreadsheet that's in I I don't know the number. We don't know the actual number I used I think I used the lowest number that was publicly available to us.
00:25:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like eating out So I need to look at And is that 80,000 every year It's yeah, it's like an average like a rolling average So that would mean So you're getting a percentage of that 80,000 and you're saying you thought you were at 6 percent Eleven Eleven Okay, was it alone? Okay. And so how many new customers did you have in 2023? And how many have you had in 2024 so far? New?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:26:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to go around the report. Okay. currently paying at some point during 2023. I'm not sure where you're at. are you asking how many individual customers paid us or how many active subscribers? Well, me ask you this way. How would you identify your portion of that 80,000? How would you identify and define your marketer? So that's what I'm asking.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many did you have in 2023? how many do you have so far?
00:26:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, the things that we track. So that. We have new customers and new subscriptions, so that 31 is actually new subscriptions, right? That's not new customers.
00:27:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
New customers is lower.
00:27:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So new customers is the factor that you use for market share, right?
00:27:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the market's 80, I'm saying we get 10,000 customers a year would up first. So yeah, I mean, offhand, I couldn't tell you how many customers we've got this year, but I could go run it. I can run that on the torque of the drop pad. Can we do it now? No, because my laptop's in the house. I'm up on Perch 2.0 looking at the ocean team, huh? Listen to your voice, listening to your voice, looking out over the horizon. All about hurt and the relaxation button band. I got to earn my phone. I was just on the support chest like an hour with GoDaddy. Only to find out I can't do what I want like oh my god. Did I really spend an hour?
00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Doing this yes, that is the worst that will literally ruin my mood for hours. Oh my god. I'm ruined. I'm a headache Seriously anytime with customer support All by itself is always like seriously wreck Emotionally I hate it. I don't I wish that I was like Full dreaming, but then to not get it resolved and to have spent that time I Don't know why it affects me so badly, but it Literally like imagine a battery icon and it you can watch it drain The life force is doing like that's what I feel like so I feel you Okay, well next week You either have that or be where we can go look at it together.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that fair?
00:29:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can send you an email reminder. Sure, I have a spreadsheet with it all and they're already, I've definitely done this. But what I probably don't have the last time I did it was November, but I probably don't have like the true 2023 total, but I can get it, yeah. Okay, what I'm asking you is by next week, will you either have that done or be where we can go get it during, okay, I'll either be done or I'll have a computer, yeah.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you need a reminder for that? No.
00:29:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Promise?
00:29:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need this stuff for those broker dudes too, because they, they had asked some stuff for them. And they, they got into our books and they were like, your books are a mess. I'm like, have I mentioned my partner to CPA, we're shocked.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mechanics car never drives like yeah yeah they're like what is this entry I was like I don't know I got to Jeff Jeff what is this entry what oh my god really so then I get him so then I send him Stacy right Stacy other Stacy that works with me was working with Sean I don't know if she's still helping probably not and then I send her impotor Jeff and Jeff's like I know Stacy and then it dawns on me oh that's right I found her to get our books done what happened oh I stopped yeah five or three years ago I'm like and here we are again he's like I just didn't want to pay her five hundred bucks bro you didn't there and her updates are hilarious she's like you haven't entered anything in over a year
00:31:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, oh, God.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Now we're paying her like $5,000 to fix it all.
00:31:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, how did that work out, Joe?
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 10 months worth of $500, and he could have just paid it. Yeah, and it would all have been up to date, and then I wouldn't be broke. you would be sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Oh, that's a good time. Oh, my gosh. OK. Oh, so, Mark, I might, um, kind of all of it out, Tina. Spit it out. You know, like, I always have like five stops that want to come out at the same time. It's the heat stroke. It's not. I'm freezing because or once everything is like, icebox and I like heat. But no, I hate it. I'm always blown up. like, is there? air-conditioning on? No, yes it is. Yeah, I don't mess with it, though, okay? Gaslighting.
00:32:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
like, there's your lighting. No, it's not on.
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so Lorenz, because we were talking about, um, how, huh? Po-changer, whatever, yeah. Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, because Lorenz went from, I don't remember what it was, like, around, uh, a million dollars a month for attorney fees, and then we had that meeting. By the time I talked to him again three months later, he had almost doubled what he was doing before. So I'm like, dude, my coaching is already paid for. You should just let me work with him, because he's still complaining about Lorenz's pace and ability to manage the team. And he's finally come around. think he talked about it on our meeting that, you know, we can't. hire the best people, which we had that conversation from day one, because he's not going to pay top prices for those people. And it would exist. Well, yeah, but yes, there's that. But also, there's no guarantee that they'll stay. That doesn't mean any kind of loyalty or whatever. I think you get more loyalty by growing people and giving them a place and they know that they're you know, CRB players, and then you raise them up, you know what I mean? And I think Lorenz falls right in that. He's not sure how to open to it.
00:33:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I'm like, basically.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, there's so much noise.
00:33:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not sure if I hear you loud and clear. If you're talking. good.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, basically the coaching was already paid for by just what Lorenz has done and improved.
00:33:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So let's just get in there and make that team better.
00:33:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Samantha, Samantha does good enough financially, and he's figured out what people to put on her team that we don't really, the fact that she doesn't want to be open to it doesn't matter. But we can work with the people who do. So then the the invoicing I'm like well we should just pause whatever you want to do with the splitting and like the end of your stuff because his 10 million dollar settlement came in and he's got to think about taxes. like just wait and maybe we'll bundle all of that together or something but uh and then there's Dolce you know the dog situation and he's working super late at night and yeah then I was a day born to Selco. What's that?
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I said 14 hours a day according to Selco. He's like a market legitimately uh as Selco said finally learning his business. All right I mean I don't know I don't know if you really realize that before the king never went to work. He was never there. He never went in. I heard you. So what I'm gonna try to do then is just tap
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
into what's already happening, if he's going to be there a lot, then I'm just going to be more, was going to use the word aggressive, but it's not really aggressive, but just more frequent in the questions and then the, like if he's here, if he's in the season of getting work done, I want to tap into it and help him, I don't know, do whatever he can do, but then also he was like kind of quiet this week. So I was like, is everything going on? Like apparently I didn't tell you I'm a human bear, not barometer or something like that, but basically when the weather changes, it's a headache and can't work, so. Oh, it's way more than that. The divorce is next. I mean, like he's going to, he's going to go, the only question is, and I don't think he will, Salka thinks he's going to go off the rails. I'm like, I don't think he's going to go off the rails. Salka's like, he's going to go off the rails. So I don't think so, man. He's. He's directing his energy in the right place. Yeah, he is doing that. But I do see him going, what am I doing? Like, and just finally cutting the cord. So I said, oh, yeah, I so the one thing I asked and he didn't respond to. And because I'm not really the one that asked this is like, did you go talk to the guy, you know, that you were asking about the counselor, whatever? And, and then I just kind of like glossed over that. Went to a big question. Yeah, but it's really not for me. So what I, what I did do is send them a good message of like, good, like, you know, kind of about what these are the things that when, when these things are shaky in my life, everything falls apart. So if they start to shake at all, I go fix them. Like in the past, it's been money. When they're when it's not there and I'm not sure about things like I'm stressed. I can't even think straight. I can't talk. my mood is crap, like everything's terrible, and then the next thing would be my relationship with the girls. So anytime I have problems with the girls, like it's bad.
00:37:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I make sure I don't ever have money problems, and I give my girls like priority, so and make sure like be proactively, you know? Anyways, and oh, the other thing is I have to get sunshine every day, like the things to protect my mood, because I'm the steward of the ship, like I'm the cat, and I gotta make all these things happen. So I have to get sunshine every day, I gotta move, and I have to eat food to protect my mood, because I'm prone to depression, and he has to, which is why I was talking about it, like avocados and salmon and things like that. But he's taking grown into the office, and oh, we knew that was yeah, he's been taking it like since Monday, at least, I don't know if he did it before that, but I think that's super good for him.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I really do. That's a good idea of channeling. But, um, the other thing, I'm like, go hug your mama a lot because to lose his dad and his dog, like, was it this, his dad passed this year?
00:38:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been recent. And so I'll give you the quote he gave to Selco. And I was like, ouch. And he said, I lost my dad. So I lost, I lost the person that helped me with my head. I lost my dog and I lost my heart. was like, that's just slightly sad. Like, Oh, Lord. Yeah. So yeah, it was. And I think that weirdly or not, maybe not, the dog dying just reinvigorated the dead dying 100%. Yeah. And so now Selco loves. Yeah, he's like, I don't know where he's gonna go. And he, those two talk constantly, constant. weird to me because in the beginning, like, I know that that's how you got involved. But Mark made it sound like he's damn psycho. He doesn't want him. He didn't want him to be in the business, right? But even that even he even relented on that. I was floored on Monday when he was like, basically, and I called this two months ago, month and a half ago. I was like, we're eventually going to get to the people. Well, we're there. Except I didn't think he'd go intake then lawyers. But that's exactly what he did. I actually talked to Salco yesterday and I said, he started with Lorenz and Patrick. But I'm like, we all know that Sam and Tyler are next. Like, nobody's safe. And they shouldn't be because that like, I'm not going to tell you what to do, Tina, but here I'm going to tell you what to do. All you got to get from Patrick and Lorenz is what do you need help with? That like Like this is I mean, it's not a nice way to say this, but like Mark's not a good lawyer and Therefore they're not good lawyers, right? So it's like they can't become better lawyers if the lawyer that they're working for is not good at the thing, right? He's not because he he if his background was he ran the intake For Jacobia Myers. He wasn't a lawyer there. Yes. He was a lawyer, but he wasn't a lawyer there He was a lawyer that ran the intake team and that's why he was good at that, right? That's why That became a strike for him here But as like an actual practicing lawyer Salka's a better lawyer by miles, right? But Salka doesn't want that's why Salka's in their training What's his name? Let's see the kids name Nick Salkos got Nick doing the LIT department, and then he wants to start looking at the pre LIT stuff, and now you're going to go look at the pre LIT stuff, and the problem with pre LIT is system. Salkos convinced, I said it to you, it's these nine steps. That's it, it's like nine steps. These guys aren't lawyers, right? Like they just have law degrees because it's a pre LIT firm, which means they're never stepping foot in the courtroom. Therefore, they're never really being a lawyer in the true sense of getting in front of a jury, making argument, blah, blah, blah. They're mostly pushing paper, and if they followed literally a checklist, then they could be better at their jobs. The problem is that checklist doesn't exist. It can exist, but presently it does not exist. Not because of his version of the checklist, Mark sort of got his version of the checklist.
00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's some, you know, disagreement about how some things work, but ultimately the data will say which one's right or wrong or whatever. So my guess is the problem with Lorenz is not managing people. It's managing the system.
00:42:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you can't manage the system that doesn't exist.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the problem. There is no system. There's a sort of system. We know that we know that A and B, right?
00:42:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So there's a black box in the middle and it's like, okay, what's happening in there exactly? Everyone doing it the same? there a way to make this better to get a higher percentage of cases settling at the policy rate? The answer is yes.
00:42:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The thing is that no one's extracting it, right, which you're great at. it. it, and then, and then, you know, once it's out, once the pieces are on the table, preferably, right?
00:43:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
start putting it together. Well, that was insightful and good. I'm trying to figure out, because he's not sure Patrick's open to it, but I think there's only one we only need one. Yeah, I agree with that. That's a good thing. Patrick isn't in Arizona, though. He's in so I don't know. I only need one. Let me hear the rest of your logic behind that. It's because they're all doing the same thing. So it's like the system is the system. It exists outside of people, right? I get that. Okay, so for creating system, I only need one. That was what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. Got that. I need all the attorneys to be their best. Oh, I was confused, but not good. I mean, the way that they get better is by working a system, right? It's like, it's like, like, and I think that the system Salco knows the system and the question is, can you take what they're saying they need, what Salco is saying, and then like Josh and go, okay, let's make let if I do this so that it's just, it's like, follow the yellow brick road. Just, just follow the yellow brick road and things we've talked about. I mean, it's super cool that like, it's all now happening and it's, it is happening faster than I thought it was, but this is like the final frontier. It's like, okay, let's figure this out. Now, whether Mark moves in this direction of, hey, yeah, I'm downsizing. And like, I'm just going to run this super tight firm at like super high margins. or not remains to be seen, or I talked to Salka yesterday. So like, Salka was like, hey, you know, like they're still trying to figure out a way to work together. And I don't know if they'll get there, but I was saying how this KSHQ to me, potentially, had solved the one thing that was like, dude, if we were signing these cases, signing retainers, instead of sending leads to someone else to sign them, like, we'd be so much better off. But we didn't have a method to do that. Like, he didn't want to hire an intake team. for a while, he was like, well, he was marks. And I was like, I don't know if that's gonna work, right? He's gonna, right? seemed weird. But now you have this KSHQ guys, and I go, so literally yesterday I go, holy , I didn't actually think about that. Like, they saw, we've never had a lead gen problem. We always had to leave, follow a problem. Right. only problem with those guys is I hate the software that they use. It literally creates work for me. So I pitched to Robert for me and him to get on the phone. And I was like, I've got a solution that will make your life easier. And it's like a living thing, right? I can get him on lead blowing and he just opens up the hood, I'll be like, yeah, dude, I can make your so much better. But then that in term, it marks the better. And then that becomes a resource for shall go. And then it can better align sweet love myself. And so I'll go with these ad surgery dudes, which is, I think. Those guys are super interesting in that they just want to generate leads. They don't want to go around with any of this other stuff. I'll be back in overall. I'll do the systems. Okay, there's something here.
00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why I would mark that that Arizona firm thing today. was like, and that might be the way to go. I thought that before, except, you know, that dude did it totally wrong, goes against private equity money.
00:47:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But, you know, it's like, just like I said, me, know, you have all the money in the world.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't execute. It doesn't matter. he had 3.3 million in revenue, and we know as pre-lit insiders, he should have been paying about 200 bucks a lead and about four grand a retainer. And if he wasn't, which I'm willing to bet he wasn't, then he was screwed from the start. And if he had never been inside a pre-lit law firm, how could he possibly know those numbers? Even better, even if he had, that firm didn't know it, marks the only one that knows the numbers, and that's because we made it the same. Right. reality. Yeah. What to think about but the I always have to think about the person like I don't I have to in in the sense that like, oh, yeah, totally. Do it. Yeah. And think about like where he's at in life, what the you know, the probability there's possibilities and probabilities, right, about where he's going to go, what kind of pace he can work at. of course, there are, we're thinking about this yesterday, I was talking to my friend, Samantha, and I'm like, there's pace pockets, like inside of this pocket, this is the pace and the pace can be different all around us. But also, we can have so like inside a sweet law, there are different pace pockets, Samantha has her pace. Lorenz has his pace. Mark has his pace and they all are under the same roof, but operating kind of at different speeds and almost kind of self-contained units. I know he's got pods, but there's that and there's the autonomy of those pods and what he's doing and whoever is the one in charge that has the power that drives that. What's going on in their personal lives always will affect it no matter how good the system is, no matter how good the tools are, but if the system is such that it's engineered to be max leverage, meaning it requires the least amount of mental effort and energy so that when that person is operating on a lower level, because divorce, Samantha pretends
00:50:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
actually mark, I mean, death, sickness, babies, all these different things. If the system is maximally leveraged, then even at their lowest, the company is still okay, everything's okay. But when it's max leverage and everybody's operating at their highest, then we have the seasons of like just sprinting and mass and growth. But because it was based on the system using the system, it should still be sustainable and maintainable. Even when things when the person slows down a little bit. So everything that I'm doing is trying to figure that out. But but again, I'm not in person. I'm not watching things we talk one hour a week. But yet, look at all the growth that's happened in that amount of time. So that's that's kind of amazing. Anyway, I mean, I think he's in the spot right now. Oh, it's like this. It's, I mean, it's potentially highly pivoting point in his life, right? like, it's like, I mean, he just has to cut bait. His marriage is a show. So it's like way worse. It's way worse than you know, let's put it that way. I don't know anything about it. Do you want to or do you not want to your call? My I do, but I should not. So that's why I never mentioned it to you. So it's like it's I have no I know why he's not doing it because I because we know him because he is emotional or whatever. But the fact of the matter is he should have never got married to her. He was warned to not get married to her. Explicitly, he was questioned. Why are you even doing this? And he did it and I think part of it is is he purposefully picks someone that's broken, right? Because he's broken. And it's like, but now I think he's getting to this place where he's like, I don't want to be broken anymore. And it's like, well, then you have to, you have to separate yourself from what the broken version of yourself is created, right? And the broken version of himself created romper room, which he, so he's going to clean up a romper room first. And he's just doing it faster than I thought. And it's like, okay, man. But, you know, he is in this spot right now where it's like, you got that $10 million settlement, which by the way, he didn't work on zero work.

He just gets the benefit, right?
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The work that he did was he got that lead. So it's like, okay, you're going to get this $10 million settlement. And now you're putting this. focus on work, and it's like, if he taps into you, in a way, it is go time, right? It's like, okay, if he's going to put his attention towards work, and he's going to bring you into work on some other stuff, and he's got this ginormous influx of cash, it's like, you know what, this is the time to take the next step. But, and I pointed this out to Salka yesterday, and it ties into just what we were talking about being a second ago, it hit me yesterday, after our call on Monday, you were like, oh, just go get another vendor. That's really not a thing, right? But the fact of the matter is, that's not a thing, practically, right? Because new people can come into the market, that's all. Yeah, but it's like, but it's not likely that we're going to find somebody new and or that they're good, and that they're going to move the needle very much, right? it hit me yesterday, I was like, oh, He's he's gonna the growth is gonna start to slow down and It's not necessarily a bad thing right like he looks outside at Steve or whatever But what Steve is doing. They're not doing the same thing So you can't look at Steve's results and expect those because what Steve is doing in my opinion is Steve is buying brands So Steve is buying these branded firms and it's not this firm. That's Kicking on Facebook ads or Google ads or whatever. It's a firm that's been around for 10 years And they did and they they're getting a lot of referral business Like if we could go into the hood, that's what you'd see you'd see like I know they don't have 300 leads from monkey and blah blah blah whatever Right they have the same people coming through the doors that have been coming through the doors for 10 years And maybe they're doing buss ads and maybe they're doing like more of the traditional stuff But the the core of that business is built around referrals in a brand And well, if you buy 10 of those, get 10x that, right? Or to whatever degree. So when Mark looks at that, I'm like, no, you're never going to be that. I mean, you will be in 10 years once you build up your brand.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like he's now going to be at this thing where his model is going to cap out. Unless and until he can figure out a way to generate leads on demand, which I'm not sure is a thing, to be honest.
00:55:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then God forbid, like a monkey or something goes up, because that's still a huge problem.
00:55:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
when a bunch of your business, I mean, granted, he's spread out that risk now across multiple vendors. But still, it's like they go sideways. You're instantly damaged. So it's like he needs to keep that in mind. So it should be like building the doctrine that built building the internal assets that you do control the doctrine at work the referral portion the bump of a and yeah, you can keep looking for vendors, but And stop looking outside stop looking at Steve stop looking at models that are not akin to what you're doing right Right and the other thing is okay, so he this week Tuesday referred me to One of his friends who's a doctor for coaching Fuji Naka Well nice, but nice yeah, he's like he was looking for a coach and He said he thought it would be a good fit so I've been talking back and forth and then he's in love with Mark like that the dude in Arizona No, he's in You know to the way that he's talking about Mark as a mentor and the way that he feels about him. It's really obvious that Mark is special to him, and I've seen enough just in how Mark takes care of his mom and how he talks about, know, the romper room isn't, like, business is his social, like, he needs a family and Dr.
00:57:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He needs, yeah. Well, it's a service.
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a surrogate. It is. He does need a family but I'm afraid he's boxing himself out there. Yeah, but my point is that I'm taking this back to pace and also to who he's modeling after. So like, and that was part of the message that I sent to him today, you know, he's modeling and targeting these businesses that are doing things he doesn't want to do. They're using ethics or a lack thereof that he would not. I want to do and so that he really needs to take into account the things like he's living this life where people Fall in love with him because he loves them and supports them and encouraging and the way that he talked about his friend was like Like it like a brother, you know, love it. It wasn't that he used but but the language was very obvious Like there is like they love each other And that that was the dude down here Zach loves Mark My point is that Mark is not these guys that he's been trying to chase after and to your point of You know, what what path he'll choose and what he's gonna do and where he's gonna go You know People do what they do and I don't know, but what I have seen Mark do Is repeatedly check himself like I've seen him go off the rails a little bit And I've seen him Do things that aren't really prudent But I've seen him respond to
00:59:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
our council and other people's council and check himself and go, you know what, I gotta just do this and I just gotta do that. Which is probably also why he's at this point where he's at where he wants to be respected and cared for at home also. But that whole thing is a long journey and most people take a lot of dips in it, but I, over the three years, what I have seen being more consistent is that he purposely puts himself in a path to talking to people who will call him out, who will tell him what he needs to hear, even if doesn't want to hear it. He will go quiet and process it rather than sound like he's hearing it and then he'll work on improving. So, I mean, three years is, that's a pretty steady... I don't think he'll go off the rail. No, I don't think so. Salco's not sure. Well, I don't think he will. Yeah. But I do think that he's going to.
01:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's going to have, he's, he's approaching as, as sort of, you know, the scales fall away, whatever metaphor you want to use, right?
01:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's happening. And it's like, it's unavoidable.
01:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he's going to have to face things that, I don't know that he's necessarily been avoiding them, but they've just been comfortable. And it's like, he's going to start to have some clarity around the things that he really does want, right?
01:00:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and he, he is good about like moving past things, right? It's like, he's moving past the idea like, oh, I can just hire someone in.
01:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can, I can just increase the size of the team and I'm going to get there. like, no, a. No, my argument was always, you don't even need to do that. The math doesn't support it.
01:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then the market wasn't supporting it either. So it's like, OK, internal, which it was him. Like when he asked you to do that on Monday, I was like, no, I didn't see this. Got me. But OK, it was a good move. Um, I just saw a lizard outside. had to take a picture of it.
01:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, I had just my chair.
01:01:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like, where did that puppy go?
01:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there it is. Yeah. Yeah, I don't appreciate non-getting puppy pictures. Gee, Dan. You get none? So rude. You sent me one picture. That's it. I'm like, come on. Newsflash.
01:01:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't take pictures. All right.
01:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
suppose I can expect that. You and you and Stacy.
01:01:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, up. is it 104 already? Because I was on support to go down for an hour. Isn't that related to this?
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, well, I got to go run. and errand but um hold on let me just close my I gotta go take I gotta go take some Advil or something. What were you saying? Uh it was funny as I was convinced it was from work. I was like yesterday or Tuesday or whatever I was like I think I get headaches when I come to work. No.
01:02:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What is it? in the back. I got them in the back here too.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's just . I'll be with . Uh oh. It might be a little bit of that too. Yeah mine or not.
01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm a little stuffed up right now. Okay so next week we are doing market share kind of numbers and figuring out all of that. I don't know. should probably even go do it right now. Yay.
01:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like I do want to I do want to know. Feel free to send me a prequel. And so look at that.
01:02:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to go adjust my class ceiling formula. Yes.
01:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% PC that. Before I send a nasty Graham to that guy. You're wrong. and here's the proof. Hi, my name is Dan. You're wrong. All right, Diana. I will. What's the Thursday? I will talk to you Monday and I will be back in the not-popped place that I hate. I'm sorry. Whatever. Have a great weekend. I'll talk. should go to the beach. You should actually get in the water. I can't. I'm duty. I'm puppy duty. I can't leave. While we're on the... She can't go anywhere because she's not fully vaccinated. don't bring her up with other dogs. That's what these shoes are for, okay. Oh, right. Be responsible. Whatever. know. Have a great weekend. All right.

I cannot tell you how many times I am just picking up my phone to text you and then you log it.
00:00:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's like the internet stop working. I'm like, I'm disconnect the Wi-Fi and now I'm getting bombarded with like, hacks and I think I'm show you what going to show you.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was behind the camera, so I can't show you this, but I'm going to show you what I did and got home at midnight last night after having done. Hold on, cuz it was crazy, damn, where'd go, here, this, you have an iPhone so I can just send a bunch, use bunch of grandma's, well not everybody was a grandma, one was not a grandma, but I am. And now I have two grandchildren, let's see, this one and this. also that so that you can see we climbed a mountain yesterday at a top of a rock and there was legit rock climbing with no equipment and some of it was pure vertical and the only way I got up there was wedging myself between rocks and arm strength because I was too short to get the foot holds and hand holds that on that rock that mountain yes it was three and a half miles there and back and we watched the sunset on top of the mountain and we could see two volcano mountains from where we were that were a hundred miles away on one side and one hundred miles away on another side and then we climbed down in the dark with headlamp so I was in trumpet AF last night mmm that was a wild that was fun it was cool how to share Uh, hey, how did you talk to Lisa at all?
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I sort of did, but not really. No, she's like in Jackson Hole or something. So she kept dropping out. So she was like driving through Nevada or something to Wyoming. We're not what the hell she's doing. So I just gave up.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much of that and that is just dead zone.
00:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so she was like, I lose you right here, losing him. I was like, and then it was like, no, here. No, no, no, wait, no. And then it actually got cut off and I was like, no worries. Oh, I don't know when she's coming back. think my mom told me, but I'm scared of me.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, um, so where's my notes, notes, she. So let's start with basis. How's that going since last week?
00:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
with Frank yesterday and they kind of they be I'm a second visa or I'm a second visa and Eric like who all met exactly the second.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay.
00:03:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All of them. Okay.
00:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're all but Norio.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah.
00:03:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. they were they were just trying to like like the like imagine Frank is like the blocks expert, right? So he's unlike the cutting edge of all that, right? And WordPress will like change the name of something and Frank adopts it immediately. He's like, oh, it's called this now. So like some of the some of the names we're using are not what they are now. So when he hears, but the word still is around.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just has a new meaning.
00:03:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what we call a pattern, for instance, this is true, but let's say it is, what we call a pattern is now called a layout, and a pattern is now something else. So they got together and they said, hey, we think there's some confusion around, like we need to make sure we're on the same page about what these things mean, or make sure that we're all using this to correct terms, right, because we think that we say this, and it turns out they were right. So it was like, okay, so they got the same page about that. And then they brought him up to speed on some of the other stuff that he was confused about, like, hey, why are you using a cloud? Why do you want to use a cloud library for this? how are you doing this? Eric's like, I think we got it, like, we definitely got it now. he's like, I think he was impressed even more. was like, oh, okay, got it. So then they said, for now, like, ranks, sort of like coming at it from a long term approach, like, Hey, you know, when you have a hundred clients, you're gonna want to be have this. And he focuses sort of in there. And they're like, we appreciate that. But we want to, we need to be working on the short term rather than the long term.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we work on the short term.
00:05:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And for us, the short term is being able to do XYZ, whatever. he's like, got it. Okay, yeah, it's like, it's not that we don't want to do what you're talking about. It's like, we don't need that now, we need that then. But let's do the now, now and then then. And then Eric today was like, he was like, Hey, I just want to let you know, like, if it would be possible to keep him around for like once a month calls, like once we get this stuff out of the way is like to keep him around as an advisor for some sort, he's like, I think that would be super beneficial. I said, sure.
00:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thinking about having. Yeah, more long term anyway.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, okay, no, because I don't, I wouldn't assume that that was possible. So he never mentioned anything about like a monthly engagement or anything like that. All that he has said to me was, Hey, maybe maybe when we're done with this, you could help me sell my stuff. Or do you know how to do that? I'm how to do this. Maybe there's mean we can work either like that. And funnily enough, Eric was today, before I said this, Eric, Eric was like, man, if Frank used our stuff, he'd sell so much more of his course or whatever.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like his check out and all his stuff is terrible.
00:06:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the code is good, right? So it's like, he's like, he's good at code, like really good. So that's the threat. So now they were like, this is what we want, we want to be able to do. These are the things, the problems that we have, let's resolve these problems. ones. So an example would be when we import a cloud template, make sure that it adopts all the styles, being able to set the global styles so that when you add a block or a gravity form or whatever, it adopts all of those. So that's what they're working on. And then showed him why it might not be the best solution for some of the that he's talking about, or we can do it like this. And he was like, oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense too. So yeah.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, the goal is still to get wolf or done by October, okay. And the G4, the journey, how are we doing?
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there's something wrong with one of our plugins. have to, I set up a test yesterday because I implemented our lead tracking on CMA. I'm for sure getting leads from ads and what I'm seeing, those events are not firing in, oh, you know what it is, the GTM container. I have to go to the container. It's not finally the container.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I just figured it out. What is CMA?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The certified management accounting exam.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we launched that site, whatever, like a year ago. It's. been steadily getting sales. So then I purposely tried to get leads. I'm getting like two or three leads a day right now. But they are not going up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. But I think I just can't a step. Do you know?
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you cannot, Dan. You cannot skip a step.
00:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I followed the swap that I created. I would have realized I'd skip a step and I'd just get it on the fly. Did you follow the process? I did not. No wonder I didn't work.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did So what else in that journey, what else did you want? I don't know what else did you do related to G4.
00:10:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Melissa is that she'll have all the stuff reviewed by the end of the day today. then she wanted to meet tomorrow. I'm not sure I can because I didn't think this stuff was tracking. But now I do think that stuff is tracking. So I need to go also saw something else weird yesterday that to go look at. Like there was an event firing in CMA that technically shouldn't be unless the way I defined it was URL based. And I said something like, hey, anytime a URL has SP in it, which would be a sales page, then do this. And if that's the case, then it would be correct. That is not the case that it's incorrect. And if that is the case, then I should have seen two other events and I didn't. So either the one event has messed up something's wrong, I think. So I have go look at that because the stuff that she's going to build is based off these three events firing on the sales page. But it would be that only a ninja because they just got a custom set up. It could and should be that they do fire on all sales pages across domains because they're not in any way product specific or page specific other than sales page is like this.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The should only throw in a sales page.
00:11:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm going to go make sure that a they're actually all firing correctly on ninja CPA. And if they're not, then I can't be with her because they're needed to build the report. If they are, then I can be like, okay, yeah, let's jump on a call and do at least one. Let's just do that one. Just broken the fix.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still going to like the custom JavaScript version of his thing, which is custom JavaScript, which I do not do, but I'm going to learn how.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. What does that allow you to do?
00:12:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's going to allow me to fire custom events based on custom documents, right? So the JavaScript says sort of like an if this, then that. If this happens, then fire writes out an example would be using that to fire my new customer event. So I'd say hey, if this is a new customer, then fire a new customer event. There's nothing built into GAPore or the GTN plugin or Woo that's made for that. So it's going to allow me to do this custom JavaScript.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see what those events are and so if you can't do it in GA4 or custom JavaScript, can you give me an example of the event?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I think of that and think you can do it with custom JavaScript. It's not going to be a default event, so a default event in GA4 would be a form submit, they have a built-in event that I see firing that I didn't set up, so a custom event would be not default, it's not built-in at all, and then it's also you're defining it, right?
00:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, like for example, was it be scrolling to a certain page?
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it add the card? Is it add the card?
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, yeah, all those are all those are built in.
00:14:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's fine. Yeah. So it's outside of those and then it can be completely custom, like new customer. No one is going to be, I mean, I'm not going to say no one, but probably very few people have ever set up a new customer event. So that's going to be me waiting for the order transaction result page to hit. And then I'm going to do a look up in the blue. I'm going to say, is this a new customer or not? If yes, then fire this custom JavaScript and call it new customer. Like event is new underscore customer.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, what purpose like just to know that this transaction was from somebody that you've never had before or like to what end is what I'm getting at.
00:14:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so then. in GA4 I can say, show me new customer sources. I say, your new customers come from Google organic.
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got you. Got you got you. Also, like, you know, then it would be like, you got this many new customers along the stuff that we already know, but it would be in that place too. And then, if I can do that look up and fire it into GA4, then I could also say, and go apply this tag in the infusion talk.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We used to work around with that with Infusionsoft and onto port with what we call the sandwich page. That was sandwiched between checkout and the thank you page, the landing page that the customer got to once they purchased. in the checkout page settings, you can always say, okay, where do they go after completion of checkout? so it would go to a sandwich page and all that was on there. was a pixel, a tracking pixel, and a redirect, a meta redirect, so that it happened, you know, within seconds. And so the customer never saw it because it's a blank white page, and it just looked like a page was loading. But that fired the pixel, and then it would go to their landing page, and it happened so quick that, you know, nobody was upset or bothered by it, but then it allowed us to get a fire, a pixel fired that wasn't built into any of the systems.
00:16:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, similar principle, except just JavaScript faster. Yeah, well, and you can do more, right, so I can like delay, I could send the event in the data layer after the fact, I can send it with everything else.
00:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that appending data is amazing. And I only seen that though, what JavaScript and jQuery.
00:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, same principle.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.
00:18:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's thing is like you can't, you can't measure what you don't know, right? It's like, I'm figuring out like, oh, yeah, want to measure. And then his custom JavaScript, so mine's like even more custom. And I can't, there's this, there's this idea that you can, you can take something like that and you can put it in as something else I can't remember the name of. But he's like, it's very rare that people use this, and I'm like, I have a feeling that's exactly what I'm going to need. And then his custom JavaScript is to do other things, like maybe you're combining events or you're defining your own where they scroll and stop plus 40 seconds. Like, I think you have to create a timer which JavaScript it does the 40 seconds. And they're like, okay, now fire it. So I'm getting into his stuff. But I think there's, and then I think once I go through his stuff, then, of course, that's going to make me go, Oh, I could do this, this and this too. Yeah, Lucy's, Lucy's working on the Lucy set up the creator user on form. It's working. We're making sure that doesn't break anything. He said, doesn't break anything. been live for like two days. Nothing's broken, but I know I haven't seen anything bad. And now I have to take the next step there is for me to get him to to insert custom meta on like I got to define the meta and then send it to them and say okay great create this meta so when they submit the form and you create the user also attach this meta magnet notes source whatever the source is in PGT I just have to look for and see like it'll probably like source not medium maybe campaign or keyword probably keyword oh and then Norio's gonna have to like I didn't know this but they've added utms so there's some new utms and then there's these new utms that have been added and then there's these other utms that are usable but not officially added that you know just allow you to and more data so Norio would have to like expand our plugin to include those, but we don't need them right now.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, one tab, there we go. yeah, so how's Noriel's stuff with high level and fan flow going?
00:21:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so he and I went around and around and there was some, so he has to sort of learn it, right, and then, but he gets to learn it, Ruby going, oh no, no, no. Go here, look at this, it does this, so he sort of gets short cut, only thing is to wait. Well, he doesn't really have to wait, right? By the time his email hits me his day is over and then when he wakes up the next day, he's got his answer provided I responded, and then lately he's been staying, he's screwed up later in the day, he was emailing me yesterday or he's working later because he was emailing me like definitely after her day was over but I think I got um everything he needs to get his first app working and then the the mod side or whatever the JD photos was named in their company the JD photos guy we we hooked up with them because they had the custom value updater that's how I found them so I paid 250 bucks to get access to their it's like lifetime access to their custom value updater but we keep running into it not working like intermittently and we don't really know it didn't work until somebody notices something's wrong kind of thing or something breaks essentially and then we'll trace it back and be like oh the values didn't get updated so those guys don't know when it breaks clearly we don't I don't know when it breaks, and then we hit them up and say, hey, this isn't working. So on the call of Monday, I'm like, man, this, when I was already thinking this, this doesn't work long-term. Long-term we need our own custom value updater, and we need one that would check, did the update occur? No, then run it again, or did the update, and if you can't, then it would send a message and say, custom values did not update something, something that would let someone know it's wrong. Ultimately, it would just not, it would just work or self-correct. So I hit up Norion, I was like, hey, I'm going to see if these guys will sell me their code. What do you need? And he's like, oh, you know, I need a walk-through or docs, and just that explains how it works, and he has seen some, he's seen the code that they write, and he's like, dude, their code's terrible. It's like it works, but it's not good. I'm like, not our concern at the moment, Norion. focus on the first part.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he like used some of their code to write his app. And so he's like, yeah, we can we can do that. I hit up those guys and told I explained to him, hey, look, listen, breaks. We don't know when it breaks. Ultimately, we need to own our own version, and I buy a copy of your code. And then we'll move it to our server and, you know, do that. Like, I was like, let me ask the developers. And then he came back, he's like, yeah, sure, we can sell a few 700 bucks.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Done. What?
00:24:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Stacy literally just sent them 700 bucks. And, uh, Nario just, I told Nario needs a loom. And, and then he's already worked with them to move code around. So they'll get it sent up on the server. And then Nario will tell me, I'll tell him what's wrong with it after the fact. We don't know when it doesn't work. So I'm sure he'll be like, that's easy.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, typical, or real fashion. Um, okay. Hold on a second. Seriously, click over there. So like, what is the, I have to go back and look at my notes from last week. Hold on a second. Was all this week? No. Yeah. I don't have like, what are the targets for what Noreo is doing?
00:25:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Meaning.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what do you, he's working on building fan flowy, right?
00:25:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's finishing the wedding, the, the wedding time. Yeah, but that's still, that's Abishik keeps finding like bugs and whatever. So there's, it's like true bugs and Noreo's fixing those and then there's nice to house or what if it. And the what if it did nice to haves are being Saved but not worked on so nor is just fixing the bugs and He got another round of those literally on Monday right right up to the meeting So he's like I'm not sure what I'm gonna be done. It's weeks, but he's like provide it He's like I thought Abhishek was done, but I literally just got an email with like five more So but he had talked to Abhishek about hey just yes, I want to hear it all and separate them like this And so they're doing that He's like man. He is good at finding this stuff and he really is So that will probably be done I would say by the end of September and Then Eric is talking to Norio about What to confirm is what we tell you about the summer day So we have the free wedding seating planner for epitome and then I bought the way of that So that's basically just a lead gen site and it's fill out this form and get access to our free win and seeding planner The idea being we generate leads they tell us engage pop up by Budget all the good stuff and then we give them access we limited access to Perfect wedding timeline just the seeding planner portion So Eric's needs to talk to Noria about okay, how do we do how are we doing that? It's gonna be a gravity form to what a webhook an API What and then once that function is worked out Greg's already done the design and then we'll just do like a super simple I mean problem. I mean I say a one-page site might legitimately mean it like there might be some Content pages that we do in the background that are for SEO, but like they're not in the nav Right, there's there's nothing for sale on that site It's just straight up you want to pre-winning seating planner popped in.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I like that. And what is, do you have like a target date for that?
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we can't use it until the software is done. So we're going to try to, once we know the connection, then, I mean, I might look at like, it's like, what is a good, I'm sure there's one, I'm sure there's one from back in the day, where it's like just a pure lead gen site. Like to me, it's just like, that you're free-winning, like, and every email. And then of course, it'll just expose the other fields. So I might just look for like, what's the best opt-in site ever? Great, someone had like a free SDO analyzer, like back in the day, like crushed.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things just didn't.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be something like that. I'm going to go find something like them and just do that. Fine. I mean, that will take Craig. 20 minutes, and it'll take like, and I'm still at the thing where I'm like, I don't want to build sites until this stupid thing is done. So there's also that. I'm interested to see like how far they get. I think they meet with Frank every, I think it's every week.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now they just back on top of vacation.
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Oh, I have the notes about high level is raising third party integrations, but I just kind of left that hanging and I don't know. remember talking about it, but I don't remember.
00:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
scenario to review but it's not like unlocked yet you can't even what they do is they they release stuff in the lab so it's going to be in the lab I want to say like yeah I want to say it's like three weeks but there was some doc there was some documentation on it when I sent you to Norio okay and on Monday he's like all review it and like you know like sort of was like this is what I'm thinking like that it's going to be like another level of being able to integrate with it and I mean that's exactly what it sounded like so it's like beyond APIs I'm like I don't know what that really means that'd be interesting yeah I think it's that you can get access to like user ID and stuff that you can't get access to be just the API so we'll see um let's hold on a second
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, so the conversation about basically having the kind of menu items and what the team can provide when people request custom work or, you know, like what's the scope of support basically for basis customers, Bobbi was getting back at that and making sure that everybody's on the same page with that.
00:31:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where is that at right now? I don't know. Did I not go to meeting on Monday? I missed it.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, it had to be over within nine minutes because I went there. was like, holy crap, I snoozed the alarm one too many times because I was making lunch. I was like, oh, it's like night after. And then I dial in and there's nothing.
00:31:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We definitely didn't talk about it.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Need to talk about it?
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't talk about it. mean, I know he was working on, but I don't know. don't know that I'll see if it should be a task somewhere. I don't ever go into work.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to knows of. If she doesn't know of it, then it's probably not passed out, but we'll see. Just to make sure that it's getting traction. Oh, Brunchy, no more issues, only reset you with the last thing.
00:33:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we figured out the fact that if user logged in and creates an API, it's only visible to that user. It's not visible to anybody that has admin access to the account. So Heather had logged in and created an API key at one point. Ross had logged into their account, Ross had landed, logged in and created an API key at one point. I wish I could be J had logged into range. And then they were something, whatever, one of the sites and they'd created an API key. So then when Eric or whoever was going in and changing the API key and I'm replacing it on the site, there was always another API key that that person couldn't see. One way or the other. So there was Eric, he didn't see Abishik. He didn't see Abishik, he didn't see Eric, so it was Heather. She didn't see Eric, so there was Eric, he didn't see Heathers. So in essence, it was always an API key available. So when the one, you know, Heather and Ross and those guys, they're not working on the site. So what was happening was Eric would change the API key and whooper and it would still happen. We're like, how is this happening? We never understood how it was happening. It was because there was an exposed API, there was a compromised API key that was there that nobody essentially knew about. So now they've all been deleted. And then Only we are creating API keys and those like do not create API key and it's definitely quelled it almost completely but Wolfers We're trying to get them moved over to stripe and then brain tree still giving us a bunch of Like we're like we're not even using you guys anymore and they won't the account Because they're like your account is still at risk. We're not using it So it's not at risk and they're like you need to put capture on your checkout will unlock the account That was this morning like oh my god really So soon as that one gets out of risk they'll unlock the account and then proceed with the migration step but they have not done that yet and I think with Think with Reset you there were so few that they just manually migrated them or they're going into, but in the brain news off. So the other two are underway. They will hopefully be off within a week or less. And then we're done with brain tree.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was the most outcome. how is another 71 doing just any updates since last week?
00:36:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually the week part is the same at the weird part is. It's the same average of last year where last year we thought we're going to increase sales because they're changing the exam, right? Which now seems like maybe wasn't totally true. Maybe it was just, I mean, again, we don't have enough data, right? Because if you go back three years, you're in this COVID world. So we're like point, like point one off. So like, let's say last year we were averaging 30, 33 point or 34 sales a day or something. Right now, we're like 33.9, oh my God, so it's like nearly identical. And then that persisted through, well, that went well into December with this gigantic spike right before the exam was removed. So we don't know. We don't know what's gonna happen. We're just keeping on, keeping on. It's still just going to come down to where the new customers come from, especially where the new customers come from in 2025, or at least from May of this year forward where things sort of return to normal, but then more so in like, okay, this is normal. We're in a normal year. Where do these people come from? It's still going to come down to that. Even if we're just back on track or back, we're at this pace of like the best pace ever. I think we're up to like almost 4300 subscribers. It's still going to be like in order to grow this.
00:38:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to know where your customers come from. Right.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's... We bought CMA exams.com, like a week, a week ago, two weeks ago. So I just was texting Bobby about that, so we're building that site. So now we'll have CPA exam.com, CMA exam.com, there isn't an equivalent for CPE, but we started getting some CPE sales, our renads for those, we started getting sales, but I'm not sure they're coming from there yet, but that'll be the thing, it's like, okay, once I can get all this tracking lined up and locked in, then we're gonna know. Oh, and the other, and then we figured out, I never thought about this before, so we started ranking for ethics exam, so the ethics exam is this exam that they have to take after they've passed all four sections, so it's like literally your final step before you get licensed, so we had ethics exam pages on CPA exam.com and then I noticed, I think it's like an off-sh of the other SEO that maybe those started ranking better, and then we've gotten an uptick in leads there, and then I was like, wait a minute, we could rank for all 50 states for those, and essentially you're gonna get a bunch of people that pass the exam with who knows who, I don't care. I don't care what you bought at this point, but I do know that you're gonna need CPE in the near future once you get your license, so that we have an ethics exam guide for all the states. So like, if we start SEOing that, then start pitching those people into CPE, that could probably work out. So Gert and those guys, we gave them, we bought like 25 SEO pages of them. We're like, hey, can we take four of those and do these four ethics exam pages, we just picked the top. Like, I know, I think we've picked Delaware for some reason. Oh, because it was the most representative what the content should look like. So we actually took one page, sent it to them. They're going to optimize that one. And then we're going to say, great, not going to these four based on the template you just came up with. So then they'll do California, Florida, Texas, New York.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, that just seems kind of like this similar type of stuff that we've been doing with Mark, which is leveraging more, don't know, sources, not necessary sources, but entry points. Yep, it is too. Yeah, the market increase and that those analytics like that systematic, detailed, accurate level, analytic stuff that you're working on and building is who else is doing that? else is doing that. Like I feel like you're going to exceed your goals quickly. I don't know what quickly is. can't quantify that, but I think that the pace will be like when you get there be like, damn, I don't like, look what happened.
00:42:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's all like, you know, whether you sell it or not, you, you know, just make more money.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were talking about getting back to your breathing stuff.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did something else, but I did it on Mondays. What'd you do? Yeah. got it. It was this other sort of guided thing because I was at home. So I like, I can't really. was at home and I had the dogs when I can't really check out for an hour. So I was like, I could probably check out here in the hammock for 20 minutes. Mm-hmm, and it worked whatever was I forgot about it was one I'd never done But I was like, oh it was it was one that was like It's like a meditation to get in touch with your spiritual guide. I was like, I'll try that I found an audible weirdly enough Interesting I want to my thought about me either I've got like a gazillion audible credits lined up.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I proceeded to buy like five books Okay Snaps, Snaps I I'm scrolling back to obvious eight and it says that your peak in the past was 4,000 60 active subscribers and did you just tell me today?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at your 4300? Oh, no, the 4,060 is the proverbial glass ceiling.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that year passed?
00:44:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, but I realized you can pass it, right, during your peak season. So my guess is, let's say, so yeah, we're passing. So let's say we, I think we hit that early July mid mid-July. I think we hit a mid-July. So from that day forward, my guess is if I take that number and the number on January 1st, the average will be 4060. It can't really be more than that because the math dictates. But can you exceed it right now? but then I also know in December, we will get three or four hundred cancellations. So let's say we get up to 44. for 100, which we may or may not, but whatever it is, we know there's going to be a mass exodus in December. And then if you were to average it out, your average is probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060. And Bobbi's like, we're past it. And I was like, yeah, that's true. But there's some missing something. And then I thought, oh, wait, yeah, of course you can exceed it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But averages are basically not that. Well, that's going to be fun to see and interesting. It'll be funny, even if it's true, because the numbers, well, yeah.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the only thing that will change it is if the 33 remain, right? That's based on it being 31 average as well, right? So if the average is stays at 33, which we won't know until November, then you can exceed the 4060. Then it would be whatever I'd have to rerun the math and be like, okay, now it's 40 109 or whatever that
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is 33 being new, um, customers, right a day, uh, subscriptions, new subscription, not new customers, customer, the customers is a 21 or whatever we've always been using 21 and 31.
00:46:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Those, those are the ones that got us.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. met Melody was getting some pushback from Melody and she wanted to build it a certain way. I'm like, no, no, no. And then she's like, we need to talk about this. I attended the call and she explained it. And then when she was done talking, she was all like, this is it. I just said, wrong. It's like, that's to be rude. Wrong. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we don't like this. And then I explained it to her and her and the other guy were like, yeah, we could do it that way. And then we all get what we want. Your way, I lose a lot. You gain a lot. And I lose a lot. This way we both don't lose. You gain what you want to gain. I gain what I want to gain. And it's all better off. So then they're like, then now they're going about building that, which is essentially it involved like re-architecting the tags. It's like a slight re-architecture. But but because it's across like six products and yadda yadda. and we had to remove a bunch of tags, they're like, all right, we're gonna go build it out and then, I'm right, I mean, I know I'm right, because I thought about it, I'm like, I'm right, this will work, and it will resolve a bunch of issues, so they're in the process of doing that re-architecture and creating the missing tags, and then writing down, okay, we're gonna get rid of these tags, and this is how we're gonna get rid of them, and then they hooked up, they hooked up a plugin yesterday that helps them, they're very concerned about like, people losing access when they have two subscriptions, which really isn't that big a deal, but even that will be resolved, and then part of the plan would also be to eliminate the infused Woo plugin, which their convinced is somehow causing some of these issues, which may or may not be true, and I was Like, that's fine, because I took portions of that away from that. I took portions of the functionality away and put it in Zapier, and it's worked fine, but we could use make, like, either or, um, so the plan is for them to get it all mapped out, built, essentially, and then, then we're going to figure out when we can launch it. And we're basically at, like, the price is going to be, like, 77 and 87, think. Jeff didn't want to do the 77. I'm like, we have to, because if nothing happens, we've done this for nothing.
00:52:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remind me with the 77 and 87 are.
00:52:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do have that, but I didn't do it good that 77 a supplement 87 is full course, right? Okay. And we just had someone, this was online. like last week someone went on a Reddit and they started this thread and it was like do not buy me just cpa review it to rip off and it the guy was complaining that he was complaining about he was complaining that that didn't refund them or something it was like super super ready and then like a mild pile on started with this other guy that came in and then all these other people started commenting and it was just it's just so sad that it's so clear they think it's a supplement they think it's a supplement and then they also questioned the sixty seven dollars i'm like oh my god and then our people showed up the ninjas showed up and they're like what are you talking about like do the math If you buy a Becker for 3,000 if you buy a ninja and you take each second up to the three months at a time time 67 you're only spent you're spending less than a thousand dollars, and then they're like just the best I've never had a problem with him. He's the only person he's been in this industry forever He's the only person that comes right just the deluge of defenders and then I guess the mods came in They weren't around and they're like yeah, we're deleting this whole thing This is this person just joined reddit and their first thing is to to track and slag on one of the best cpa review courses There is delete they deleted the whole thing.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get the screens?
00:54:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's first no like I Was like it I was like on my phone To get well we have tons of those there's tons of those on on reddit So I do want to start using them on the new sales page because I think they're more powerful than yes You know testimonial block We have great ones. We have whole threads that just wave about us.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you for sure should be using them in your marketing.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. We have one that's literally called is Ninjacy. And this is like someone asking a question for real. Is Ninjacy Pay Review a scam? Like I couldn't have paid to have someone do that. We use it in our emails. In case you're wondering if Ninjacy Pay reviews a scam, go here. And it's all these people raving about it. We have this one dude on Reddit that's like are one of our biggest defenders. He's like, I passed all four sections using Ninja whenever, but his screen name is Nutella Nick. Oh, I know. I'm like, oh, buddy, it's hard to recognize you in marketing. Only because it's a trademark term, not no other reason.
00:55:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. But he showed up. He showed up and like went off like, this is .
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but couldn't you use it and then just like black out parts of the username like and you.
00:56:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, we don't even need to use this. No, there's tons of them. But I want to use those instead of the, I mean, we created these testimonial blocks. But I'm like, and we have like the Reddit logo. I'm man, we should be using just straight screen caps of those. And then, and then them in those locations, rather than us cutting pasting the actual thing and linking to it. Like we'll cut and paste and then link to the actual thing. But no one's probably clicking through. mean, that's something I can look at. But I doubt people are clicking through. Whereas they, if they see it's from Reddit, just from the, like literally like a better and then videos. It's like, okay, those are probably your two. best but i can split test this video testimonials yeah we use those those totally work i was just about to ask you about them because i think that like we have tons do you have a social media account or you just share that stuff regularly uh we i run them as ads on facebook this one this girl made is so good oh like oh my god you couldn't it's like it's like she made it on purpose but he didn't right and she sent it to us and we turned into an ad where do you stockpile your testimonials the video ones are in this service called boast and then the text ones we don't even gather anymore we just have so many it's ridiculous yeah but you should keep them current uh i mean they're not I don't think the date. I don't think we put dates on the testimonials. Um, any of them, really.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I don't even think we gather.
00:58:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, we gather them on the cancel. So they do, they do updates. I just haven't used a new one recently. Sometimes I'll you, I'll check out the video ones and maybe I'll swap in the video one here and there. Uh, but I try to let, you know, I'm trying to get someone that's like, they use Becker. They, they're a ninja only, right? I can only use like so many. Like I was with Becker and then this, right? So it's like, okay. and then I ran some of his ads and like you see which ones did good as ads, then I put them on the landing page and then I ran a test on the landing page at which one do people watch the most and I made that one first. Did you like that?
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish that we got to do another 71 completely separately because I I would so love to drive growth there, that would pay, would love to drop growth there too, hopefully I'll be able to do that as soon as the stupid tracking is worked out because I don't know how to drive growth there. I have so many ideas and there's stuff that you touch but not systematically. But once you get that set up, we'd be able to track everything. But it needs to be set up because I literally just been throwing stuff at the wall for years.
00:59:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still convinced I could turn off all the ads and nothing would happen. Or it would happen but it would take six months. I'm like, I don't want to find out that way.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Gosh, it's crazy just thinking about, first of all, it was seven years ago, and then you're like, I don't do email. I'm like, it doesn't work. I know, I know, look at that. And then maybe you might still be right. But regardless, the thing is, we've watched, we've learned it together with Mark is that there is a, you know, having multiple, so for him, it's vendors. For you, I think it would be channels, ad channels. Oh, yeah, like a formal approach and multiple tactics to what you're applying on those channels that don't in and of themselves make huge differences. But the compounding effect are like, first of all, anytime things dip, you don't really dip, you don't even feel it because everything else just kind of buoyed it up. But yeah, but the analytics portion of it is to be able to have very clear, reliable data is huge. And just
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
all the things that you've learned over the years anyway adding adding into that anyway that's awesome holy crap how's it 105 i could just whatever toy flies okay wait so meditations we're good you're taking care of you sound good found the good you've only just got her moving date so we gotta go visit the campus and then she moves in on his two day 2021 20 is a Friday i'm like probably moving in on the 21st that's a temper yeah she got her dorm assignment she's gonna have two roommates and a expert large triple and everything i mean it's the oh she told me the name of the building it's like an author's last name no i think it's a hog So I think can tag another, I don't think that is another, so the HAG haul, I guess, and I don't know what the hell is up with college right now, but you want to talk about a light schedule. I was like, you're kidding. That's it.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like four classes, period. What? That's it. That's it. And they're on the quarter system. So it's 10 weeks. And we have four classes, 10 weeks, and then 10 weeks. I don't know if some of them carry over, they're two quarter classes or whatever, but she's like maxed out on credits, which is like, I literally can't take anymore. She's like one credit guy, I'm like the total max, and that's four classes or something. And then her earliest classes at eight and her latest classes at eight p.m.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But also also.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a wide.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
breath yeah so what's she taking on that like what's her major bio no biology microbiology okay how far away is she doing the school yeah it's eight hours drive uh it's an hour of life hour now how is Denise doing i'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking able and leaving really yes yeah you don't need the care i'm like for though i just look at it as part of life i mean it's what happens unfortunately things move forward where we march on it's going to be interesting how mario handles not having a sister around even if they don't get along you what she's already acting weird yeah it's it's hard i don't know if it's related, but it's like, I think it might be.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're they're talking, they've been talking more than ever the last like two months.
01:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like amongst themselves or whatever. And she's definitely over the I hate Evelyn face. I wasn't that long, but it would be had for a while. Yeah. then, yeah, so it'll be interesting see how her and Denise react.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you revolve car, you need the ocean, and you need to figure out how to keep those two happy, because this is going to be very hard for them.
01:04:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I, whereas I was like, you know, she apparently, so Jenny DeRoz went to the school to UC Santa Cruz. And I don't know what I said to her, but she's like, Oh, yeah, no, like, you're only guaranteed housing your first semester. And then the second semester, it's like hit or miss, or your first year, you have to live on campus for year, you can't have a car. And then your second year, you can apply to live on campus. But it like hit her mess. She's like, it's like, she said when she was gone, there was like a borderline crisis to get housing. And then everyone's like, no, it's still like that. Like everyone's saying like getting housing the second year. So then you have to get off campus. And Jenny's like, when we went to go off campus, she's like, I literally, you need a dossier on yourself to get the gut housing. And then we go apply for it. 50 people are applying. And then it's like hit her mess. And of course, my takeaway is like, oh, I should buy two bedroom condo and Santa Cruz, little mirroring.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that play.
01:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, that's the entrepreneurial take is property. Right. I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pay rent or, or boarding to the school, why wouldn't I just pay to myself? Right.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm paying it either way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. like, I should go to, so a two bedroom condo. 800 grand, so I'm like, hmm, let's see how this election pans. I got about a year. like, can hit the fan between it's gonna hit the fan soon. What? they just revive, you see that the labor, the jobs, number revision that they just did, they're like, oops, turns out we were over by 800,000. You're kidding. Really? So that, until that, so that was like two, three days ago, leading up to that, and still even yesterday, people were talking about, oh, bed's gonna lower the rates. Well, part of the way they do that is they're using employment or rather unemployment as like a leading indicator. So it's like, they're like, unemployment's good, so you can lower the rates, is sort of already. And it's like, hmm, but if that number It was run by 800,000. Isn't this other number wrong? Like, isn't this leading indicator fake balls incorrect? Well, it's like, yes, but if they so they lower the rates, I mean, it sort of where this if you I was someone would show these charts, like the parallel between what's happening right now and like the two right before the 2008 crash is like very similar. A lot of the indicators look the same. So it's like, why wouldn't it go that way? And then lowering the rate. People are like, you know, a lot of financial people are like, you can't lower these rates. Like, you can't do that. You could trigger a much worse outcome. Ron doesn't say the whole time. There's no way this ranks. She's like, there's no way. There's no way that they keep saying soft landing. She's like, I don't see it. I don't see how it's possible. You have to pull a rabbit out of a hat. She's like, I don't believe it. I don't believe this is real and I would come in due time, like it's either it's going to happen, and then that would be like this quarter, right? They do. They only meet once a quarter. That meeting's probably in the next couple weeks. So they're either going to do it or they're not. And then the markets will react based on that. And we'll see. And then God only knows what happens with this election.
01:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want this. I don't want either one of them. But here's the thing about Trump is like, we know who he represents him. He represents who he is, what he is. We know his pattern. We know his MO because he's a steady douchebag. But like what his strengths are, we have some definitely definite economical power, There's there's some good.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's disgusting.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's right. Kamala is a puppet. Like she we don't I don't even know who she represents. I don't know what she represents. Somebody's behind her, now no idea who it is. I don't know what their MO is. I don't know anything about that. so she is a wild card that puts us at huge risk. And we have no idea. But why I think she'll win, which I don't want, but why I think she'll win, is because I think she will bring out the female and black voters just because she's woman and black, and that between the two of them, that's a population that has been largely just like, if everybody, I don't really care. I think a lot of females that never voted well now. And same with black people. And I think, and especially looking at the stats right now, how amazing she's doing, which is, again, terrifying. She's stupid. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't stand for anything. And I don't know who's behind her. That's the most, yeah. So like in terms of like business and needing to create as much. Like I want to get to being able to rent my house out, buy another one, like have some property investments as soon as possible. There's no solid guaranteed investment, but the one thing about like in my church, we do food stores. I'm like, I'm gonna have property stores. If I meet family to live, you know, it can either make me money or it can house my people, but one way or the other, like that's where I want to start with it. Like yeah, kids. So okay, let me get back to your Denise Rowland for a second and the girls eight hours away, holy crap, you should buy the property. She is gonna hit the fan. I'm so glad that you're doing the work of the analytics right now because that foundation, like as she hits the fan, there are, and this is why I teach what I teach, it's fundamentals, right? There are certain types of things, clean, accurate data so that you Because a lot of people are going to be trying to guess and figure out what to do, and you're going to have the ability to know what to do, plus all the things that you've already built, the systems, the teams, the reputation, having had a very smart offer for a while now, especially with it being the subscription model that you already paid the price for, all the dip and finances. There's so many things that you've been doing, and we knew that the recession was coming. It took longer than most people, most of the analysts, most of the VCs thought it was going to take because they pumped money in, but we knew it was going to happen. And it gave you enough time to do such a good work, but I don't like, I mean, you might feel a dip, but it's not going to hurt you at all.
01:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Why don't you think that will be a dip because in 2008, I went and looked at this at one point. randomly because of David in 2008 when that uncertainty enters right it's not going to help it helps his business because people are like I need to get a new job right I need to they also retreat to education so they go my domain and yours so they retreat to education and there was like a we got a bump a noticeable bump back then and we didn't have our own product so it was like oh that's interesting and you could see I look up here I think I looked at search day I looked at a bunch of stuff I was like oh that's interesting plus we the if a pandemic didn't take us out pretty sure research is not like it was like they shut
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
down the entire business and it was like and we made it yeah that's it's crazy but it's awesome also if i can just get through whatever the it's just the having taken care of everybody so long getting myself so far in debt trying to do that when i get this going and all the data that i have with it like i don't worry about anything also because of the investing that i'll do but like there's so many there's so much volatility for so many people which is why i'm helping three other families but it's it's scary for other people and then i'm going to see so many people i care about just struggling because they're already struggling because things are so expensive but it's also amazing to me what being strategic and consistent can do for people yeah yeah anyway all right well good job I'm so glad you're doing the GA4 stuff. I cannot state that enough. It is so important.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, good job.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really make some good plans for Mario and Denise and Evelyn too, although she's probably going to be having fun, but then she's also going to get very homesick and that you're going to be in the middle of all of that. Good luck.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do think it's great. Here's the silver lining. If you time it rightly, that's a word.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It actually is a word. That's the right way. You can like a flight to San Jose is like 60 bucks. So I was looking at that in my company. That's what we doable. So you could go visit her at the drop of a hat and it's not going to, right? Like 45 minute drive. Easy peasy. Like you could do that in the day anytime. Anytime you wanted, um, which was not the case for my parents playing from Boston to DC there in the sixty nine dollars life Made major of airports. You could just show Denise all the things that are on the table because she still doesn't really get like what you're Doing this. Yeah, we're gonna go. We're gonna go visit now because now we can go visit I was hoping it would play out like this. I go. Okay, great. I can buy a flight for like next Wednesday We fly up in there in the morning running a car driving the campus ago. This is your dorm This is where your first class is.
01:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this.
01:15:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is that We're looking at like theirs target. Okay, great because we're gonna be here in two weeks doing this. Yeah, we're three weeks doing this again.
01:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, good. They're gonna do good, but keep using that brain of yours for Building your family because this transition period sucks. It's hard But it's better when you're when you when you do the planning and when you do all this stuff. they're just going to need you. That's all I'm telling you. They're going to need your even killed and an entrepreneur. We solve these things.
01:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that bothers you. Let's fix that. Goodness. No parking. We're at the office. He's like, something's here.
01:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You took her to the office.
01:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Someone was supposed to be here. I mean, Eric and Stacy, and then I was like, can't be at home. Someone else was supposed to come out of office, who I think just, if it's them, I'm going to be surprised that you knew it was somebody else. Because Eric and Stacy, walking around the whole time, you haven't made a sound. I guess this is the other person's here.
01:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have, Zinni or Bell? Bells. All right, so I will let you go figure out who that is and I will talk to you Monday.

Hi.
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi.
00:00:02 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How are you? I had to feed the animals. The animals. Yes. Oh, my God. My nephew was so amazing. He went back to Guelph, which is about two hours away. He just got back from two months in Europe. He graduated, and he took a year off before applying for a master's program. But he's going to do his little side business cleaning people's eaves troughs. And he was so cute because last night he was asking me all these questions so we can rank on page one of Google. So I was given everything to do. They said, I'm going to clean your e-shirts. Well, I'll pay you. You said you're going to charge $150 per house. No, you gave me so much free information. I'll do for free. So he came over dinner for free. I took all these pictures and videos of them so you can use Google Business listing. And then when I left and I came back, he had also filled up five bags of leaves because we have lot of leaves from the fall. So I sent him a hundred bucks. Aww.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a good kid.
00:00:58 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's a good kid. Yeah. How are you feeling? you've had lot of meetings and you were gonna grab something to eat before our call.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I grab something to eat. feel like I have something and my teeth is driving me nuts but I'm good. My kidney hurts a little bit but I have kidney pain a lot so deal with it and that also goes with diabetes so um and I've always had hypoglycemia and had issues so that makes sense but you're going frustrating and moving on.
00:01:30 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well um it's Halloween night are you giving up candy?
00:01:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't really clap. I live on a hill so I can just eat the whole city which is wonderful but you don't really like climbing up there so.
00:01:43 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh no it's good. If the drug oil rains here it's because I have to go give out some Halloween candies so it's like all right.
00:01:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah you're later than me.
00:01:50 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well it's 4.36 it's not bad but it's supposed to rain tonight so if I were a parent I'd probably take my kids out earlier than 11 later so we'll see now.
00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. You ready to get into this?
00:02:01 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me screen share. I want to go floss my teeth by now is what I want to do.
00:02:10 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Are you okay? can come back if you want.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I might take you up on that in a minute, but let's see. All right. So we were talking, I'm getting my bringing together. Um, first we were formulating the rocks for the. Yep. I'm not going to call it Q4, but really, to me, it goes into the first two to three weeks of January. Um, because trying to end things just at the new year, like the last two weeks are not, yeah, and really productive at all. Yeah, by middle of December, then it's going through my January, especially when you're talking about offers. Oh, I'm just review this. I didn't get or anything, know, that's what I think it made me one. Okay, so this is just going to be the one thing I didn't put in here is that this we will be organic organic. If it comes, it comes Q1 of 2025, we can consider actively marketing. I'm going to move this to the top because really actually, you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take all of this and make this Q1 block, a Q1 rocks. Can I say this? I don't want to call this. And then add a card. here one in there. I just want to edit it. Oh, one card. There we come. Okay, we'll set that. And we're going to move this up here. Meeting agenda. That's not what I want to do. So I want to. I don't know how to do this. It's just is this card. would just want a new board.
00:05:07 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would be on the left hand side where it says boards and I see it says your boards and it's a plus sign.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:14 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We prepared our boards of this.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. We'll see. This whole thing is considered a board because that's a workspace and this is a board and this is a list. It's not a, it's not a board that I need.
00:05:30 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a list. Oh, okay.
00:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, no, that's not right.
00:05:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what I can say, um, get rid of the menu on the left, hit X.
00:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hold on a second, because I've got the, um, not the right, sorry on the right, hit X. Yeah, which I don't even see because of zoom and got it.
00:05:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think the new list will be behind there, like after your last list, you can probably hit a plus. So keep going. Yeah, to the right.
00:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go. It's you. The Atlas name. And so I'm going to call this quarterly rocks and I'm going this list right over here. Good job. Thank you so much. Quarterly rocks and I'm going go queue for rocks and okay. And so this, I'm just going to move it into here even though we've got the image, there were some comments that went into there. And so meeting agenda of the E Queen. So one, three, high level done free clients. We're not talking about that right now. That can go. Let's see, quarterly rocks. that's the list. And the to-do items. We think about how any of this part of part of what we're going to have to do is figuring out. how to structure things as we go, but you'll, it'll be beneficial because you'll see, you know, like how I'm thinking about it because you're here with me while we do it. We'll also, I broke my nail earlier and I have to fix it. popped off because my hormones are like, so normally my nails don't pop and come undone. So I have really good stuff, but when my hormones change, one of the indicators is they don't stay sealed. so they pop more often. So anyway, we've got all these different things that tell me my hormones are whacked. But it also takes a little bit longer because I have to figure that out, but it, while it takes longer on the front end, it makes everything go smoother once we, and we get traction faster.
00:07:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like this was something that, oh, okay, that's because it was business HQ. So I'm going to move that list to my business HQ. I don't really know where I want to put that because we have a few different things.
00:08:16 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is this what you do for a lot of your clients?
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just kind of set up something like this? Not anymore. Not for a very long time.
00:08:22 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't do ops for anybody anymore. Just consult. Right. Gotcha.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody has project managers. so we do that. But I don't have a project manager. We will do this for ourselves. But it also is a great. And most people don't. And they don't have anybody good at it.
00:08:44 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the ones that they have, I trained.
00:08:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It's good too. It's a sharpening. My soft kind of thing. But also. This kind of structure, people need it.
00:08:57 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So.-hmm.

Mm-hmm. It's. Rained up it's getting all the ideas out and having a place to be and then it's being able to put things and I say taskify which is not really a word but put it into a task an actionable item but then when you see it you can look at it go there's a logical chronological way that something needs to happen and then you can also start to see dependencies well chronologically these could happen simultaneously except this is dependent upon this is dependent upon that and normally people aren't looking at things like that especially if that's not the way that brain works which most people don't yeah so if we can train them to do that even though we can't give them like I can't give you them my brain to be able to process the way that I do but the visualization kind of leads leads them through it and so they can start thinking. It's, there's a saying that it's not believing or seeing is believing, believing is seeing, it depends on who you're talking to, whether not they think one is the other one is about faith and one is about whatever. But seeing sometimes is understanding and knowing. And so anyway, the visualization is really powerful. So project resources, I don't even know what this is. So we've got a master plan. We'll update that anyway. For us. So let's do what's happening now. So in progress, you are a live masterclass for you to I mean, that's a long thing, but it really is super clear. Yep. Yeah. And I use the ampersand for that. All right. And it would help if I could type things correctly. So let's just talk about this here a little bit. Last class. Where are you hosting it?
00:11:31 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Zoom. Time. What date? This Saturday, 10 a.m. Two to three hours.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember. Second. Second. Easter time.
00:11:49 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. It typed in November 3rd. It doesn't.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Small minor. Okay. Okay.
00:11:55 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I shouldn't have any. 10 a.m.
00:11:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
10 a.m. Okay.
00:12:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and Eastern time.
00:12:03 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, you said three hours. Two to three hours, yeah. And then on core repeat of it live for the people that can't make Saturday and also because I'm sharpening my saw and learning more on this, getting feedback Wednesday at 12 noon. So that the day after election day. You know, as a Canadian, I totally forgot about the election. Yeah.
00:12:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a time to have it depending on the I think a lot of people could not hear less. So it's interesting. The world is very different right now. Like, I think a lot of people care and a lot of people don't. think a lot of business owners don't. They're like, the best thing that I can do is more my business. It might be even more of an incentive for them to like take control of their lives. who knows, I would not not do it because of that. So yeah, statistically Tuesdays and Thursdays still Tuesdays Thursdays and Sundays are the best days for they're the most downtime type of days. So for webinars, like Sundays at 6pm, people are in their emails and they're buying stuff and that's been true for years and then it was still true. It is still true.
00:13:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's why some people have a lot of their end of like sale Tuesday night because then they have Sunday and Monday Tuesday. But let me tell you my thinking here. I actually prefer not that many people show up live, right? Because I only wanted to sell like minimum 10, like a grand just to cover it. But it looks like I might make three grand because there's like two grand now already sold. So more people bought today. But my concept of this is just without writing it down, which is explained, and this is kind of how I do things with us while teach this right sharpen the saw like it forces me the deadline to get all the curriculum together the SOPs together the checklist templates, but the final version is and this is what I told them all the emails they will get one year, Compton to all the upgrades to this program. So when this becomes or if this becomes $1,000 or $500, whatever, they don't pay anything more. They get one year access and that I will be creating a members area. And these will really be a sort of one three hour long video. They'll be like more like 10 videos, 10 minutes each, you know. So really, this is going to become a more, you know, what you call it easily to digest? yeah, consume course plus. I'm buying time because
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we just had the meeting yesterday to determine what is the big rock we're up selling this to eventually and we'd agree to be more of the CM pocket CMOCO offer and then also I think it was also like a maybe a group watching thing maybe or is it more just the but anyway so when I know what the end result is then when I record videos and stuff I can indoctrinate them into that other offer right so here's what I think you should I think everybody should keep this in mind all the time if you're going to be in any kind of coaching I think you should have top middle bottom tiers and the and there's multiple reasons for that but I'm going to touch on them super fast sure top tier higher money higher effective hourly rate but also higher level energy coming back from your clients when you work with high level people they teach you as much as you teach them you learn from them it's also higher energy and just higher value so it kind it it financially energy basically and intellectually fuels everything else that you do, the high level tier, okay? But you can only do a little bit of it. It also takes a lot of you energetically and intellectually, okay? The mid-level tier is to me, so we're talking about the 10% that not going to do a lot, the 10%, they're going to succeed no matter what you do, and then there's that 80%. And this is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most that are most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing, and we're gauging that by the things that we've set out. to attract them as well as the things that we've set up to filter out those who don't match this particular group set really well. So but they also give a significant enough amount of money that they that we're earning from them and they help fuel you know our lives and what we're doing in our business but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching right so we're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest pool of it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping what we need to do to improve what we're doing. Then the lower tier is kind of our give back but it's also the most scalable it's the most hands-off so it doesn't cost a lot anybody that wants it can probably afford it. by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week, if they can't, you know, if they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of this, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does don't give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do. So, anyone coaching and teaching should have all of these tiers for all of the reasons that I just said, they need the center group for the feedback loop and to make the impact, because anybody who's coaching wants to make an impact. That is part of what made them go into it in the first place. The high level group is needed because of what I said, because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. Um, you also want to have high level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high level connection. So that's important. And then the lower level thing, again, is just the super scalable, um, low, low impact. And if it continues to do well, that's also a market signal saying that this market still exists. Um, it continues to deal with lot of impact. So a lot of touching on it and everything that you do feeds each other. So everything that you do to serve your high level clients should, should come down. So you create, um, the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points. Three levels of earning power three levels of energy, you know what I mean, um, so it can be That you have those three levels for YouTube, but I wouldn't do that because The to be a high level YouTube creator and coach almost really feels like you've got a high level in video production and Yeah, in their minds probably yeah, and that seems like a lot of work Because there's a lot of skill involved. We're talking about huge processing power Yeah, time suck. So having a top middle and lower class for YouTube itself does not seem like a great idea as YouTube as a channel inside of marketing inside of a marketing Operation business hybrid makes much more sense to me as you are such a generalist and I am as well even even in my systems operations that if we're going to have an and you can't the bandwidth required to do more than one high-middle low level type of offering as a coaching consultant would take too much more than I would be willing to give more than you would probably be willing to get so to me that is the offer it's business sustainable um business growth um profits however you want to call it through a marketing systems and operations right and obviously it needs a sexier name but but that's it and so hopefully that gives you some clarity does yeah yeah so yeah um one of the things I'm going to do is put in um to uh
00:22:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Upwork just like an example looking for someone who can like here's the here's the problem you go you go to Fiverr to hire someone to do video editing for you and Because everybody's mind thanks to Helix permosi is on shorts They're charging like twenty five dollars for every minute because I think you're gonna do a 60 second short, right? From the scripts like well, yeah, well, use Veed and or cap cut myself But that's the first thing I want to outsource and so there's no I'm gonna pay twenty five dollars times ten minutes Right, so I'm just gonna go to upwork and offer twenty five dollars per, know Five to twelve minute video promise. I'll give you like, you know one video a week But probably more right because maybe share that VA with my students.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got a girl you could try Oh, it's not amazing. She's good and she's trainable. She's very smart and she loves to learn she communicates. Well, I think she's from Pakistan.
00:23:02 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on a second. Yeah, I still want to post the thing when I work because that's part of the training, like how to hire a VA as well, you know, but yeah, yeah.
00:23:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was a work. Hold on a second. All right. Messages. She does Canva too. See if I can get her profile for you. I don't want to be a profile. No. Copy and then chat. I'll put in chat for you to open up. Thank you. You can look my carpet. Oh, so I posted a job. I can always tell from a cover letter of somebody's and be good if they're going to be exceptionally good. I'm trying to see where her first thing. Yeah, so I was needing somebody to do some combining for me and I posted a job, let me see, actually I'll job post. I'll show you because I wanted to show you like how just my process with it. So data organization virtual system. View job posts. Looking to combine several Google Docs into a large document, these docs are transcripts and the time stamps and other speakers removed before adding to the master document. Some are already in Google Drive folder and some will need to be extracted from note taker as at least 100 recordings. It's a simple task but I'm looking for a quality. send who communicates well is prompt, ask questions and as needed and cares about the quality of work. There are options for added opportunities for more work if you're interested to communicate well and are reliable. If you're interested, please send a cover letter explaining what interests you and let me know why I should hire you. Also, let me know if you prefer short-term clients or long-term clients, your attention to details required in order to be considered. So when you hire these low-cost people, generally speaking, you're not going to get a very articulate response and they're definitely not going to tell you how to solve the problem. But if you did exactly right, honestly, this is her reply, I'd suggest using Google Docs find and replace for you to locate and remove time stamps. I did this with AI so I ended up not doing anything and she says I've used this approach before when working on a project where I managed several interview transcripts and it saved me a lot of manual work. extracting records from a recording from Father NoTaker, I can ensure that everything is downloaded and efficiently. See, into the Google Drive folder you've provided, here are some other virtual assistant jobs I've done. And then, I'm genuinely interested in this job because I enjoy working on Google Docs and I'm well organized. My previous experience and handling somewhat transcription tasks as well as my attention to detail, notice the Oxford comma makes me confident I'd be a great fit for this role.
00:26:21 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
always ask questions when necessary to ensure I'm meeting expectations. mean the Oxford comma?
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I guess that's not really the Oxford comma because that would be the list.
00:26:31 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, just never heard of it. I'm just curious what you mean by that?
00:26:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's writing. was in key writing classes and things like that. The way that she uses the commas are extremely, this is very good English writing. Gotcha, She just did incredibly well. then we followed up and had different stuff. I ended up not needing her for that. So I asked her what other skills you have. And she does Canva and videos. Let's see, she shared a Google Drive with me. And like I said, these are not amazing. But because of her video response, her video, her emails, think that she could do really great if she's just trained and given instructions. She's very smart so she could do well. Let me show you this. Do you feel overwhelmed and anxious when it comes to taxes? All those laws, regulations, credits, Okay. And she's definitely got some interesting clients.
00:27:53 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a big business hydroponic towers.
00:27:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I want to get into it too. We do. just giving a huge like so good music she shows good music I think she was probably provided all these video clips so anyway but she is I think I hired her at like eight dollars an hour what was the contract view contract yeah eight dollars an hour so she could get those videos within your budget is what I'm saying mm-hmm if you're interested in that yeah so yeah okay so thank you for that time too you're welcome um every really really good I don't know experience whatever that's not the word a good track record for hiring good people through work and long term. It lasts for like years and years when I placed them with clients.
00:29:06 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to say, shoot, I lost my turn thought. Oh, do you use that scribe? I remember that tool you're mentioned for me to use.
00:29:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I haven't, there's nothing I've wanted to do with it. But no, but I do think it'd be very cool to check out and try if we had. Well, like if you're going to break a process down, which is what you do a lot, you know what would be really good is like your video where you doodled. I think you had a few of them, I know you had at least one. I would put that through scribe and see what it does just to get an idea of what it can do. Yeah, I'll start breaking the process down.
00:29:48 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'll start playing around with it for sure.
00:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what can I do to support you in this and making sure that this goes well? let you get this recorded. I think, and once we get some feedback on how that call goes, there will be a lot that you and I can break down and then put into tasks and really start building something around that. But before you get there, how can I support you?
00:30:26 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think probably once I get the, like I said, high level in my head how I'm going to teach it, maybe when I just get the high level curriculum kind of put together, which will be tomorrow. I'll just shoot it over to you and look, you don't have to reveal because it's not going to make or break Saturday, right? But if you get a chance to review it, I think next week, the support will be more my thought process to make this a killer product, the final product, is going to be like, there's a part of it that and actually it's not going to be able to to be done next week because I want to get feedback from them and do a survey and all that stuff, what the challenges are. But my nirvana is for one aspect of it, and if it goes into a low ticket funnel, this will be up to one or up cell two, and is like ability just to hand off the SLP's to VA to do some work for them, like whether it's the research method or whether it's the video editing method or this the upload to YouTube method because I don't feel, hold on, I need to make sure I understand for you to hand off to a VA or them to get instructions and them to hand it off to a VA. Yeah, this is for the higher end product, right? me give you a better example, context. One of my friends has the organic group method put into a little ticket funnel. His upsell one that converts for $97 like crazy is called the automated growth stack, where hey, I will give you all the SOP's you need to hand off to a VA to an or to build and manage your Facebook group, only $97. Yeah.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, and so it's a $1 one time, not a $97 subscription.
00:32:11 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Correct. Unless we make this, remember, we're still deciding whether to sell it by a on demand webinar funnel for like $197 or $297, or whether we put this all into a low ticket funnel with the traditional $7 thing order bump of so one upsell too. Yeah.
00:32:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that I'm just thinking about this, let's see what you get out of the training and get all the feedback that you can. would love to be there and watch.
00:32:54 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you're welcome to.
00:32:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Observe and support.
00:32:58 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I don't know what the because they do have girls this weekend.
00:33:06 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know what's going on. But I'm repeating it on Wednesday, remember that. And remember, this is my warm audience. I could just prepare, prepare nothing and get on and get some and love me, you know.
00:33:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yes. was I going with that? Oh, yeah. So just seeing seeing seeing the feedback, seeing what gets excited. So you're going to do it on zoom. Zoom doesn't have analytics does it?
00:33:35 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where you can you can measure engagement or does it? Um, I don't know if it does, but it'll be too small of a pool, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
To really look at that. don't. Yes, it'll be a little bit different. It's definitely something to look at in the future. And you could probably get a pretty good temperature by how people are commenting or asking questions.
00:33:56 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I. You know this to be like you're just as good at this. I've been doing webinars since 2006 So I I orchestrate the engagement to a lot, right?
00:34:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well what I what I'm trying to get at though Is that um what I'm thinking is that whatever we can do to you know make it a a product stack that has All leads Anything that we can do to make them self-liquidating leads, right? So and honestly if it's all coming from YouTube, then that's a moot point because they're free You just putting anything but to to be able to convert as many people as we can into buyers Um, but I think that there's a stop point here, which is just like because we already talked about it We don't want to get into long-term YouTube by itself You know one-on-one Poaching time slot with Maria or you can get into our business growth stuff or YouTube marketing is a conversation that we have Because marketing Is something that we talk about often and YouTube marketing is what we're really loving right now So the only upsell beyond whatever this package is there is no Monthly subscription unless you join the the business growth one But really do you not need it because are you not trying to grow your business? Are you not trying to do it smart? you not trying to do it leverage? Are you not trying to do it optimize and Instead of just getting YouTube, you're getting all these other things So that's kind of what what I was thinking is like whatever the stack is that gives them everything that they need to follow your system On top of that if they want support Community access whatever it's either by maria's one-on-one time or
00:36:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
into our group that's bigger than YouTube but definitely includes lots of YouTube conversations because I can't imagine you going week like not wanting to talk about hey guess what's happening you know right right right and there's a whole other aspect that's not going to be covered on this part of the course but I think if we're now making it for offer owners and affiliates I think a huge aspect of it is branding personal brand right um so uh yeah and I've got um a friend of mine who's that life coach Melanie Childers she's gonna either pop on then or just do a separate call to help specifically the people that mess to be that said they're little scared to get on camera so that's just gonna be a bonus recording your space this YouTube accounts that that do really well so if you wanted to go do some research on that you'd be able to provide answers to those those people they can do really well yeah yeah yeah It's funny because I I I I've been in the last few months of faceless YouTube school community and she's she's made six figures herself with a fitness faceless thing um which is kind of cool and she just bought PLR to some fitness videos and created a youtube channel and think I mentioned this to you called five minute exercises or something but yeah go ahead.
00:37:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you know that less than two percent of youtube creators uh you you tubers create their own content that less than two percent of youtube accounts are actually create their own content less than two percent.
00:37:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
where'd you get that stuff from?
00:37:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:37:36 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Look at it.
00:37:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah because it's um it was um it was comparing tiktok which is even lower it's like 1.5 on tiktok and then two one percentage of you tubers create one and four of those creators and create video content. So that's 25% still.
00:38:08 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow, it's very low. It is not what people would think you would. So, so is that meaning the rest is faceless?
00:38:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that kind of what? No, it's it's saying that it's curating content.
00:38:20 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, like, clips, somebody else's clips and you add something to it. Oh, got it.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. it. But it's not their own original content.
00:38:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, first of all, what I mean is that the opportunity out there for people who have something to say is huge.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but also for people who don't want to be on camera, if they're following your strategy and creating the content according to your style, so they could do whiteboard drawings and have a picture of themselves or no picture. But as long as it's First of all, it's not all have to be visual, but if they're following your plan, let's say they get 25% less results than you do because it's faceless.
00:39:11 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it still not amazing results compared to nothing? Right.
00:39:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So it's still tapping into YouTube. Maybe you're not getting full power of YouTube because of this. But YouTube is a content provider. It's not just a face of your video, you know.
00:39:34 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I know, I think I mentioned this to you. I know one guy I consulted a few months ago. He was just buying the master resource rights and private label rights to faceless videos on Etsy. He bought them, then he created a frickin funnel. He's making 30 grand a month selling them via ads to his funnel. Here's a thousand faceless reels and he has a little died on how to do faceless reels and TikTok videos and YouTube shorts. And he's so doing so well, I haven't heard Boo from him for the last two months.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how well he's doing. Do you more help on this? So I wanted to get into that for a long time too. So we can do a case study where I'm following everything that you're doing. And they're following me while I create some content that is around. So like I got a, I told you about domain, videoprofessor.ai. So I'm like, what if I just teach all my stuff, but I don't, it's not about my face, it's about the content or whatever, what kind of results does it does it get? So and I'm a huge fan of leading by example. So for those people that have those questions, you could say, look, worst case scenario, you spend $97 and you learn that it is possible or it isn't possible. But regardless, you're going to learn, is the knowledge worth the $97? This is what this is so so this is what I teach people all the time They want to think that their money has to get a specific kind of outcome like that has to be money I'm like, but when you go to college, you're not guaranteed a job. You have a degree You paid for the education.
00:41:17 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh Consider yourself paying for the education.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're coming here. There's no way you didn't learn something There's way you didn't know what you didn't hear something now you have to ask yourself And I'm going to pay Maria for teaching me that so I had a new thought that's going to lead to a new thought That's going to lead to a new thought that cannot be measured the thoughts. So here's another thing Anyful can count the number of seeds in an apple, but only God can count the number of apples in a single seed Because in that seed very tree the tree bears apples those apples bear seeds those seeds bear trees and so on and so on and so on When you teach somebody a new thought and a new idea that is the seed that will bear. So it's important to use that. think you teach people and say when you're looking at this investment, like I'm going through a course right now and it's $2,000 and I found somebody way better. And he's got a refund and I'm probably not going to finish this course and I'm thinking, do I ask for a refund because I found something better? like, well, no, because I learned from him.
00:42:24 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right.
00:42:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I found something better.
00:42:27 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But if I go buy a dress and then I go find that dress, I'm not going to go return that dress.
00:42:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people would.
00:42:33 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Some people would like.
00:42:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not if I've already worn it and tried it on and I go find another one and I never wear that dress ever again. You know, that's just part of the buying experience. But I'm not going to take away from somebody who moved me through and gave me some new ideas and thoughts. Maybe they weren't one, which is another one. The last I will say, when I market things and talk to people, I'll plant the seed of business karma. do you want to be a chronic refunder? Because you reap what you sow. If you don't want people doing that to you, don't be that person to other people.
00:43:14 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. no, I'm from believing that too. $2,000 course was that you bought?
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Day trading.
00:43:23 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay.
00:43:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I love it. I've always loved, like, I feel bad about now because I know more about horses, but the first time I ever went to a horse track, I picked the winners all but like two races. I'm just really good at stats and processing.
00:43:40 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, I don't like to see how that goes.
00:43:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I also want to understand the stock market a lot better than just the economy and how that goes. anyway, I did that. then I was like, man, this other guy is like way faster because the one that I'm learning from, he's so slow.
00:43:54 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he doesn't go linear. It's not well organized.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is he just brain dumped everything that he knows and it's good and it's useful But he isn't the best teacher Yeah for learning, you know, if somebody's better at teaching, gonna learn so anyway.
00:44:13 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, it makes sense Got it. Yeah. So anyways, um, yes to to that and it is on the rise and like You know, obviously there's gonna be so many Aspects of future changes of how AI is going to play a role in this, right? Cuz do you want to go like you and I talk about this the other day? Hey, Jen, right to create a duplicate of you and and to create videos for yourself, you know But I will tell you what you just said though that very few create their own stuff. That's probably why some of my videos Do so well because the comments are like you're so authentic like it because I think it comes across versus if it was just crowdsourcing what other people say. look, I'll admit, some of my videos is kind of crowdsourcing bit because I'll look at what's top and ranking stuff. Oh, this guy did a video on how to combine chat should be T and create an ebook.
00:45:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I've done that before, so I'm just going to teach it too. So there, there is another thing. And I wish I could quote it for you, but I've heard it from two people. But because there's so much information, it isn't about content creation so much as content curation and distilling. So what people need isn't all this information. That's what we've been selling as info marketers for two decades. Yeah, yeah. And we all know that it's paralysis by analysis and overwhelming all of this stuff. The winner is the one who can take the complex all these things and break it down. why I get paid so well, but also what I've seen you do is you break it down to small strategic steps. If you're talking about creating a list that they can go outsourced, you don't get more simple than that. I would say a few reasons, but I would say the biggest reason that you're being successful and will continue to be successful is because you have the ability to distill complex and and big quantity down into small things, but then you add your personality and your love on top of it. But that's difficult to replicate, so but if you can teach people that if they can do that, so they don't have to have the same personality or necessarily articulation, but whatever they know, if they can take what they know into the simplest actionable steps, people will love them also because it saves them time.
00:47:00 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and mental energy and their brains are tired. Yeah, and I was going to start the the the off of drawing a big circle and saying this is all the information about YouTube and how you can make money with it monetize it. I know this much about it. I'm not saying I'm the expert on all things YouTube but I know that this little bit that I've been able to do has produced results and that's I'm going to teach you this a little bit so you're not overwhelmed and you can choose to learn all the other stuff if you want later but just do this as your foundation and you will get results.
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep it simple, you know. I'll add one more thing to that. Is your goal to learn everything that there is to know about YouTube or is your goal to have YouTube help you get be the vehicle to the life that you want to making the amount of money that you want because if that's your goal you don't need to know everything about you. You need to know just enough to get to the results that you want to get to so it doesn't matter that I only know this part because I know the part that gets me the amount of money that I want in the amount of time that I want. That's what you're teaching.
00:48:05 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that. That's it in a nutshell.
00:48:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because people don't quantify. They don't ask themselves this or that. So they go in and I think I need to be a YouTube expert, which relates to I need to know everything there is about YouTube. How many times have you heard somebody say I got to go study and learn everything there is to know about this? Yeah.
00:48:25 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I wrote out the books this year.
00:48:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What did you and part of that's buffering though too.
00:48:32 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're feeling busy because they're learning but they're actually not doing and making money and getting proactive avoidance. That proactive avoidance, that's the words you use all the time that I love proactive because I'm writing this down so don't forget and that because there was a guy yesterday that asked me what makes your YouTube course different than the others right and I'm going to write this down proactive avoidance. I just said because you're not going to have to spend tens of hours like in other courses to actually try to figure it out. I'm just going to give you a simple system that's worked for me and got results.
00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I would say further, here's how I can prove it. at how many videos they make and look at how much time they spend on YouTube. And look at me, you're not seeing these about hours and hours and hours and hours of video. I'm putting out.
00:49:16 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It seriously is like three hours a week, they can do it.
00:49:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you can ask that, do you want to live on YouTube or do you want to live?
00:49:24 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't wait to get sales page rock and so you can add to it. All right, on that note, candy people are going to start coming, the little kiddos.
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I keep seeing you go like this, so we'll let you know.
00:49:40 - mariagudelis (Maria Gudelis)
because well, I don't know how well you can see it, but that's the the outdoor. So I'm waiting to see kids walking by because sometimes they have already been some people walking by. And so it's getting dark as you can see. Yeah, yeah.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my daughter needs to be done, lock the door for me. All right, she's got back. Okay, I will talk. See you soon. Have a good weekend. Have Halloween. Thank you. you. All right.

That's weird, it's like grey, hi, hello, how are you, good and well, yeah, deep breath.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, today is, this is our, my work week, so it's every day, every day, lots of meetings for me today, but I just came from a saw, so I'm trying to wake back up because she put me out.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
awesome. Yes, my lady, she's a Russian and she's been taking care of me for years and I just go like, like, I get baby like little girl taking care of and I'm like, oh, it's the best so. And then I was like, Booty paid for this today. Hey, glad to, glad to accountability. I like felt bad about it for a minute. I'm like, well, you use the one that wants accountability and you needed this. So we just get you to do your stuff without punishment. Then I'll pay for my own. Just happily. And you will have learned the thing.
00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't feel bad at all. I didn't get it.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are you ready to work on this today?
00:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
looks like you are. Yeah, so this is from July. I'm like, you know, like we talked about two weeks ago, we hired the manager. been really good. I've been giving him, you know, little by little bit, giving him some of the tasks that I do, of which, you know, tracking the numbers is one of them. So we expanded this based on what we talked about, I think, two weeks ago. then last week we completed it. And so these are pretty much all of our data as far as we can go back and track. So we opened in April of 2023 and you can see we got 87 people that first month, we didn't really keep track of it then so we just started it the next month but essentially after that we started tracking how many new visits we completed and these are the follow-ups and you can kind of actually see that we were actually doing okay in some of the months like you know some of the ones last month we got 94 so this month we're we're act you know like we talked about we're actively trying to seek out second visits and third visits from from case managers. Awesome.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to process the data but also I have some immediate thoughts. A couple of things are number one I would like to put a formula after column B which is basically the current month divided by the previous month. or, you know, and going up and down so that we're looking at a percentage of change, increase or decrease month to month, just kind of eyeballing the fluctuation on a percentage level. The raw numbers are helpful, but just that other perspective just kind of helps take a look at things. And it also is a faster way of triggering an appropriate level of alarm or yay, you know, celebration when you see those percentages. So we can do that pretty easily. And then I know that we don't know what you get paid per visit. I know that that's a unique thing. But what I would like to do is, and we were starting to calculate just kind of average fee per visit. I know how not accurate that number is. I am aware of that. But it gives us something to look at that does have a real corollary value, you know, to kind of look at how things are going. So as long as we keep that in perspective and don't, you know, and I know you won't, but just, you know, I'm not going to go. That's a real number. That would be something that would be good for us to do as well. Sorry about that. Let's see. It's all of us. It's okay. we're tracking Washington, Arizona, Mexico, familiar state to me. I'm meeting with Jonah and Margaret too. this is, this is my sweet love, oogee day. Good people. I like good people. All of us is completed. I love that that number went up. up even though number of referrals went down. So, let's see, actually, never mind. Okay, so total NP is completed. That's what I actually want to look at. And how many of those were referrals? NPV. What does NPV stand for? It's the first one.
00:05:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's initial new patient visits.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a new patient visits. Okay. I was like, I know, think that that's initial, but I don't know of course. I think she massaged my brain just late. Okay, so that didn't go down that went up. That's awesome. That number had a couple of dips out of curiosity. Do you happen to have any idea what happened in November and December that your numbers went down? could you pinpoint that to anything? Or is that just? July is referrals and so this isn't like Q and me is the one that has a lot of you, right? Yeah, this is July. Okay. Um any idea what that dip was about?
00:06:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, this is actually up in so up in these first six months I did all the marketing myself, meaning I'm calling, you know, was calling case managers like Mark's team and I was just begging them to send me a client and in October I actually stopped and I I bought three different marketing companies. So I put each of them charged me $1500 a month to market for me and I I said, Hey, let's try it. So I I tried three different companies. Only one of them actually did anything and I cut the other two off. But that's what happened in October and November is I stopped doing it myself. And I think you could see like by January like the three marketing companies, they started getting a little traction help me out a little bit. But the first few months that I stopped doing anything on my own, this is what happened.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you still doing it?
00:07:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm just using one marketing company and yeah.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:07:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And again, like this, you know, this value for a number of referrals is where I always wanted to be was about 400 a month. I thought just 400 referrals a month was good. know, 400 total visits would also be about right. So, you know, if we can get this every month combined with this number of total visits. That's actually kind of where I want to sit.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's highlight those.
00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. But you know, the other thing that Mark was saying is that, you know, we're worried about the insurance is tracking me and trying to become too big. But I, you know, I hadn't really talked to Mark about what, hey, what if I go after just other states, right? know, and obviously they're tracking me in California, but what if I really try to. higher or do the marketing myself in Arizona and in Mexico, Washington, and really try to grow the volume there. But I haven't really explored that.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, can we make that a task? I didn't mean you make it a point of talking to him before we meet next week.
00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that'd be fun. Because it's really tough to end.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And the sooner we know, the better. I heard that you guys might be having the most epic 24 hours ever.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I just bought a car like I told you. And then last next week, we're buying a $4 million house. yeah, yeah, I will not be participating this year unless it becomes a little bit.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he had quoted like 50,000 a person.
00:08:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's like, I don't know about that one.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just had a brownie baby. And that's a little bit on the dangerous side. If I was us or I'd be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, But that's just probably way cooler than me.
00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, she's actually letting me go to my friends for you for a big, it's next month.
00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, it's different than like drifting, okay? And just like, oh, that's crazy. I saw that like my heart.
00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looked really cool to do.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Father updates on July front to help us meet this volume I actually brought on a fifth provider. It's a physician assistant network like all the four physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are working for me, all like they like working for me. So they're all like, hey, can my friend get a job with you? So I finally picked one that looked good. And so we brought her on. She's actually starting right now. She took a shift from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. So she's seeing patients like right as we speak, this is her first day. So yeah, excited to do that. It'll increase our nighttime. And she's going to help in the evenings. weekends, particularly.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that'll help our capacity at those times to accommodate this volume. And what do you pay for that?
00:10:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I pay $75 a visit, whether it's a new or whether it's a return. And I increase their salary or I increase their pay to $30 after like six weeks.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's still a good margin for you and let you increase capacity without burning out?
00:10:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, on average, we make about what 300 per visit blended between using returns, right? So I'm paying them $30 and then my staffing costs about probably about $30 on the back end for each visit, so.
00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so yeah, that's good. And they're per visit, not per hour.
00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah, totally per visit. I also pay them to if some patients want like a doctor's out to be excused off work. So I pee smell everything. charge, we charge for that. I charge for that to the lawyers. And then I subsequently pay them $12 if they write a work note for someone. And what do you charge for it? I charge $300 and I generally get paid about 50 on that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But $300 for the doctor's note?
00:11:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
For the doctor's.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. But you only get 50 out of it because of the way that, okay, got it, got it.
00:11:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, I've been about 25%. So yeah, so maybe 60.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So another formula that I want to have is the percentage of our PVs to NPVs. So that we're looking at.
00:11:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I feel like we, I was supposed to do this. Do you think you could find the notes from last week? I was just looking real quick. I think we actually talked about. doing these things I just never did them.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and I didn't send a follow-up to actually make it an official task, but we did for sure.
00:12:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I wasn't so familiar. So I'll work on those and get them done.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I mean, ultimately, and the faster we do this, the better your results are, right? And my goal is to make sure that you see the value in showing up and doing this work every week. This could be as possible because I want you to keep coming back. was like working with the same people. It's really nice for me. We do, we do. go. And the notes, that tasks.
00:12:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I wanted to show you this one. This is something that you had kind of brought up about how we can track our workers remotely. so I want to the metrics that the manager and I came up with, it was just we look at their call logs like literally how many patients did you call a day right because if we know how many new visits or how many new referrals we got you know so if we got 300 in August that means there should have been there's 20 working days or there's 22 working days so there should have been like what 10, 15 calls a day and so and then obviously if you don't get someone the first day we call them at the second day so like if you can't look at any two days generally about right like they're calling you know most work days they're calling about not so many they're calling 20, 30 people a day something like that now Ollie Ollie actually works part-time she only works four hours and Eric and Carolina were eight hours so it is actually kind of interesting like most of the times it's almost double but there's some days where you see like she does almost as many as my full-timers so it's something the manager and I are going to look at, and this is the blended average so far that we created here.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would do additionally is actually put in the hours just so you again, there's something that is really powerful, and this is why we use the visuals, and also why we do specific types of formula and put data in a particular kind of way. Because what we want to do is make our brains be able to rapid-fire, get to the most powerful conclusion. So if you were to do that, put hours for each one of them, and then create a formula that were average calls per hour. Okay, we did that. Yeah, so oh there it is. I'm just focused. have tons of I thought it was. and I thought it would be the other way around. Wait, okay. So, when you say Eric slash Carol, how do I say that?
00:15:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, he has wife split a full shift. So he does the morning and she knows you does four hours in the afternoon.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that column H hours or calls?
00:15:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is this column is how many total on average they did for day.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so where are you getting the formula for calls for hours? where are you getting hours in your formula?
00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Or did you just plug it in? Oh, we first we looked at just the total number of months or total number of calls they made in a month right here. And then we divided it by how many hours they work, hundreds in general.
00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was wondering where the hours came into the equation. Okay, so, because I thought you said that I like got more calls done.
00:16:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, this is actually wrong. Yeah. She only worked 80. Yeah. that is right. Yeah. that's right. Yeah. That was wrong.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ally is actually working like double speed. Yeah. that is significant. And let's, I mean, if we were gonna have to do even math. mean, that's roughly like 50% more.
00:16:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how to use percentages.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you do? in this case, you would divide 1.52 by 2.46 times about 100. No, just divide. You'll get the same thing.
00:16:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just move the decimal point. That's all. Yeah, she's doing 61% more. I don't know it.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that doesn't make sense.
00:16:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's. Yes, she's doing 61% more. Yeah.
00:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because if she was doing 200 percent, we'll see.
00:17:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
she's doing 100 more than that would be 3.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. So she's doing 60% more.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then two people. So either one of them is very slow or both of them are slow. Or maybe she's just super fast and we do have we do get lucky sometimes and get because like Mark Scott, this girl Samantha and she kills everybody. She smokes everybody. She is a massively driven. You can't just go get us a man but you can't. So that might be what but it's worth looking into. It's worth considering. Do we share team numbers? Do we drive internal competition and incentive by saying here's the targets and here's the and maybe we don't want to because like the other issue Mark has is way too much incentive in his program and he's paying too much in payroll for it so we have to do the math before you offer any kind of incentive program but for sure at the very least this is something we need to be contemplating and not just look at and take it and go like okay that's dinner and not do anything we're there to be such a big disparity either you've got a rock star or you've got slackers and if it's a slacker situation then that's something that can potentially be trained potentially be incentivized or potentially you replace them but either way it's something to be thinking about
00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you want to look at China?
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see her say hi. Oh, my gosh.
00:19:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. Hello. Yeah, we were just going to go take a nap and say we're going to say hi to daddy and then go take a nap.
00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I missed the little one so bad.
00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, so beautiful and perfect.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's just a perfect blend of the two of you.
00:19:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. It's hard to tell her right now. I know they're so young. Yeah. Just trying to get to sleep in her own crib so she's not like contact napping all the time. Oh, just like you can't give anything done during the day.
00:19:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember that battle and I wish I had leaned into it way more than I did because that goes so fast.
00:19:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You cannot believe how fast it goes.
00:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I shouldn't try to train her out of it too quickly. So here's the thing. you sleep very well with that Puji?
00:20:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I sleep better without him.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We both agree that we sleep better like separately. Everybody is different but it's been interesting you know because I've got two that are all the way grown. I've got two grandkids and two that are mostly grown plus sisters and siblings and just working with people along that. There's this huge, I don't know, we all listen to different things and feel different things but trying to get kids to sleep alone and and parents get frustrated that they won't do it and those people, most of them don't want to sleep alone can't sleep alone and it's funny that they want really tiny children just to be able to be alone and be comfortable when it's not the natural thing. are cultures that are never away from their children. They pack them onto their backs. They don't mean you see that a lot and co-sleeping is just a lot more common and other cultures around the world. Yeah, so but you know when you're a driven mama and you have an active brain and you want to use your brain That's an important thing to and taking care of you is an important thing, and so it's difficult But the one thing I would say is whatever your heart calls you to do Lean into your heart more than your brain Your brain will get outlets later, but if you hurt your heart that damage can be So long-lasting and that's where the regrets come from not helping your brain I promise you Okay, that's good advice.
00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to take out more of your precious hour with Tina, so Thank you wanted to show you something else that I am working on You want to So, okay, so this is where I really Can you coach to step in over the board? Yes, but yeah, I'll just show you what I am done.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, the Bing.
00:22:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bing background. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I have an online clinic and I have a company. We haven't like we just sort of started, but we market this thing. You get a brain MRI.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see my screen? I can and you told me a little bit about that.
00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, yeah, so anyway, I just, just kind of, we're just starting. this. And again, the payment structures are fluctuated, but essentially my cost for this brain scan is $1,000 of my cost, and I'm reselling it for $2,500. So each sale makes me roughly $1,500. And yeah, anyway, so that's that. I am just starting it with the founder of this technology. So anyway, I spent all yesterday night making this payment platform and this website and getting the bank account set up. So finally, everything's ready to go. have the business registered, I have the bank now, I have the website. last piece I need to do is just structure the clinic side a little bit better because I'm serving all 50 states.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and where do your customers come from?
00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right now, they come from the company itself. So this company BrainKey out of Germany, people email them from the United States and it's like, I want to get your brain scan and since they don't have a US presence, they are sending them to me.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they say, hey, you have the machine that can do it, basically?
00:24:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, we have contracts with the imaging centers. A lot of the same ones Mark uses for his PI cases, actually. I just go to them and get a contract with me. Okay. So that's why it's the $1000. So the $1000 is about 800 of it goes to the MRI center where I send them and then about 200 I send it to BrainKey to analyze the results.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the value is in BrainKey's evaluation and reporting or, okay, you give me a little bit more about the USP, which is the unique selling point of why, why then?
00:25:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, they're the only brain analysis software on the market that can do these volumetric measurements. So if you look on this little screen, they're sectioning out the brain based on what structure it is, and they actually measure how big it is. So we could track over time pretty clearly, like if you're developing Alzheimer's, you're going to see this really specific area of your brain, unfortunately, strength, They show that that part of your brain, the amygdala for alcohol actually shrinks, shrinks, shrinks. And we could see it get bigger when you get better sleep, when you stop drinking alcohol, et cetera.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And who's your target market for this?
00:25:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you have an avatar or multiple avatars? Yes. it's usually it's Asian males that make over 150,000 a year, they're single or not single. But it's Asian males over 100, making over 150,000 a year that would be. between the ages of 40 and 50 and, like, 58 to 65-ish.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that demographic is within your realm physically?
00:26:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
A lot, because most of them tend to live around the major city centers, where I have the contracts with the centers.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why Asian specifically?
00:26:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I think, I don't know. not sure why it's Asian. I mean, obviously, I think the majority is like, they're like, it's 50-50 Asian white male. I'm not sure why. I personally think it's like the midlife crises that these people are dealing with in general. Like, why it's a lot of males and not as many females.
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could give you lots of reasons why it's probably more males and higher earning males, just because what got them to the higher earning was very stressful on their bodies. They overworked.
00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
probably during too much did all the network too much.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They did a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do and have gotten to the point where, especially now in this world, we're very aware of the clock ticking but as well the opportunity and the medical technology that can buy us another decade or two. Whereas women, not as competitive, do a lot of things that are better for their hearts, they talk to each other, they've got a network, they're more aware of health in general and probably haven't neglected it to the extent and are also less likely to go and pay and spend this amount of money on themselves for their health or rather they'd go get, you know, breast and butt lifts so they look good for the man because that's not really for them, that's for somebody else kind of thing but the psychology behind it makes perfect sense to me to say it's part does not necessarily make sense to me and it's not really necessary because You don't have to, in the marketing, target anything that would be Asian specific, but the reason I ask about the avatars is because you do want the marketing to speak to them wherever they're at, whatever their values are, and for sure there's a, there's a huge difference, I think, between Asians period because of the collectivist culture with just the standard American, which is the individualistic culture, the values, the reasons, the logic for doing things is different. And so, like if you were going to, and I don't really know how much that applies to Asians living in America as much, but anyway, just the language, right? So are you doing this for yourself versus doing this for your family? And you would probably want to split test some of the messages. We would probably want to have a few different landing pages and keywords research campaigns. based off of what's happening. What I would be interested to know is what they know about marketing that works in other areas and what they would be willing to share with you.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the only one that does this here. Yeah, so that's what's interesting about this opportunity to me is because brain key right now is only sold through brick and mortar concierge clinics. So the only way they're getting customers is they go to a concierge doctor and says, hey, give this to your clients and those are their salesmen. I'm like the first mass market clinic for them. But yeah, but because of that, you don't really have a good sense of like who they're, you know, who's buying it or why they're buying it because all there's, they see the data, right? They see how old the person is male or female, just from the scan data, but they're not actually talking to their clients, which is really interesting. It's like, yeah.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea what percentage of doctors are Asian in your area or in any of the metro areas? Just wondering because culturalistically, more, let's say any other nationality to Asians, you're going have Asians and like Filipinos, which is a mix between Mexican and Asian, right? There's a huge drive to be doctors. So, I was wondering if the correlation just happens to be that there are more Asian doctors and they're pitching it to Asians because they're like, hey, I think you might like this more than some of these other people that don't, I don't know, like I'm trying to figure out what could that possibly, or could they have got that demographic from? anyway, my brain, I'm always trying to analyze because if you understand the demographic and the true data, then it makes marketing that much easier.
00:31:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I just, yeah, the company, even like the owner, I, and I'm friends with the founder, he's just like, sorry, man, I like, I literally don't know because we don't sell this. It's only the upstairs doctors that sell it to their own clients. And yeah, like, I was like, well, do you have numbers? And he's like, well, not really.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your, when you first thought about this, and up until now, what was your plan of attack for marketing?
00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I actually talked to Mark a lot about this, and it was really just to run Google ads. our thought was as long as I could make, you know, as long as I can make $100 more than my ad spend, it's very straightforward business, right? Yeah, I'm just, essentially, just reselling this product. I'm like selling online.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has, has Mark ever mentioned Dan to you?
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is a client that referred Mark to me that we do work together and Dan's very good at Google Ads and also Google Analytics. So especially because this is a new market, we're going to need to make sure that you've got analytics and that we're watching it closely. We're going to want to have a heat map on here. Do you know what a heat map is?
00:32:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Kind of like where they're looking and clicking.
00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're also going to want to watch the behavior to find out what they're coming from. I think that some YouTube ads would probably be the most leverageable thing and the great thing of course is that combination between YouTube and Google is that you've got all of this data and they do, they're just really good at targeting by the algorithms, know, who might be interested in that. So if they're doing something that's relative like looking up a particular issue whose solution is you need an MRI. Guess who's at they're probably going to start up. Who's running ads for MRIs? Like nobody probably. I don't know. Anyway so creating some YouTube ads would probably be a good idea and a lot of that could probably be done with AI videos now. You know of course we could actually hire some people but most of it could be some either stock videos or a few like videos of the machine of the reports things like that with a voiceover which also could be AI. It could be a voice actor which we could pay very inexpensively off of Upwork something like that. You have a good voice. I think that's so weird but you're not anywhere near the first person to say that. I hated my voice until I was like mid 30s and Now I won't do video because I feel so gross and ugly. mean, I spent all Saturday. I spent my time doing videos for marketing. Can't do it. Anyway, this is life. We've all got our weird things.
00:34:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Anyway. But I was so excited, you know, I feel your excitement in this. And I think the same thing as your keen in on is what makes me excited is because it's really something that if I can get the marketing right, this can make a good, good, like another stream of income for my family, you know, if I could just make, you know, 10 sales a month, , that's, that's an extra, you know, 120,000 a year.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm really happy with that. You then have a massively targeted list of potential other things that you could offer them. So now you're not going to know what their test results or whatever.
00:34:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is that? No, is one of the things that, yeah, I wanted to sell because the one of the. The big things, if people take a test step six months and nine months, if they sleep better, you can easily see their skin improves.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was one of the things I was going to key in on, was like, um, what are we talking about when we first started talking and talked about naps and Steve and all that stuff.
00:35:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:35:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, having like a list of people willing to, willing to pay money to improve their brain. mean, yeah, I think well, a significant amount of money and also there's, there's more to it than that. So you might have people who are willing to pay money and invest in their health, but this avatar is scientifically minded. This avatar is not just about health improvement, but this guaranteed is going to be about life quality and longevity. And that's a whole new level up here. Okay, right? That's not the person who's like maybe trying to cut sugar. out of their diet or be on a diet or whatever. This is the person that is like this is serious, this is important and so I don't know how much you studied marketing but if you were to study direct response there's a guy named Eugene Schwartz and he what's it called breakthrough advertising. You would do really well to study it that book is dense it's owned by one of my clients actually so Jean is referenced so many times. He talks about levels of awareness so you've got the I know nothing about whatever you're selling market all the way up to I know everything I'm just looking for the thing to buy. There's like seven levels of awareness and if you get to the point where somebody has bought this their level of awareness of brain health of what is needed. How do you avoid amyloid plaque and not get Alzheimer's? How do you, like, could you as an affiliate offer have some sort of brain training program and software that you create by yourself that helps prevent Alzheimer's? Like, there's so many different things, and if we're looking at you being in this business and having the compounding effect of additional revenue streams where you're, it's scalable and you're not doing it for your time. This has long tentacles out into the future that, and you can build it, and then somebody would probably go buy it from you for, like, $20, $30 million if you were smart about it because you're disrupting right now, nobody's doing this.
00:37:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair. Alzheimer's is a great thing. This is actually one of the first campaigns that I wanted to run was actually run a campaign for Alzheimer's.
00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what if you, so have you heard that ultrasound waves are now able to... to break up amyloid plaque and that is the first thing that they've ever found that can reverse Alzheimer's. Yeah, there's been no way to get rid of amyloid plaque until now ultrasound, which makes sense that that could do that, but that it could safely do it.
00:38:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting.
00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm also a medical nerd. study a lot. Health and longevity is a huge thing to me, so I like working with you.
00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good.
00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't tell I'm excited in my brain lights up about this, but anyway, if you found a service like that that you could also offer as concierge or make referrals or something like that, you already have the market. Oh, your scan came back with. And so because of HIPAA, you're not going to know anything, but what you can do is say, hey, you know, if you get results like this, here's what you can do. If you get results like this, here's what you can do. Now, HIPAA doesn't allow you to like ask questions per se or whatever or know the information, but they can self-select and I'm interested in this. So you have cause and effect. They select this, therefore, you know, probably assume the correlation and now you start marketing to them this type of thing. And then we get into email hygiene and how much better that makes your inbox, placement and all kinds of other things because you're super segmented and.
00:39:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I guess that's why like I and that's the tough thing right now and I wanted to kind of get into too about like, you know, my time balance because, you know, we have we have something good going in July. And, you know, that's why like, you know, much how much my time should I be putting in July to kind of really pump, you know, pump my July business. We have the Q and is, you know, that we're making some changes to be more efficient on, you know, I guess, is this now a, you know, is this a good thing to really go after the delta, you know, I call it delta.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll tell you my overall strategy for everybody. And first of all, business 101, the verification. Your best bet at success is multiple types of things going on. So the first thought that I just had when you went back to July medical is, you know what, that's probably the way to build the funds to, you know, make sure that you've got everything that you need over here to invest in some marketing, to invest in some good advertising. Because if you're not, if you're going to do this, do it, do it right. Yeah.
00:40:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's not a, you mean delta?
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah. But the other thing was I was like, well, maybe that just takes off the bumpers off of July medical, and you grow as big as you want to. And then somebody gets attention. and then and pulls you down. You're like, okay, bye done. But the insurance take care of its job of the liabilities and whatever happened to you and be like, okay, pull the plug on that. Moving on, thank you for the signal universe.
00:41:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah, and it's kind of just and you said that too, because we're, you know, I'm looking at the total amount of AR that we have and we just passed $5 million in AR, which is about one point, you know, if we get a 25% return, that's close to that's close to 1.5 million. So I think if we keep even just at this level, we're accumulating AR at about about three million, four million a year, just at this current level. So yeah, it's a good point that, you know, even in five years, if I get pulled down by insurance, I'm going to have accumulated, you know, close to 30 million in AR probably by then.
00:41:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not only that, you now have some assets, you have doctor referrals, you could pretend actually sell something, have some sort of asset that is sellable, so maybe it's not the entity, but maybe it's the contacts, maybe it's the business relationship, and if you go and tell all these people that are referring to you and you go really vet the person, so somebody buys your business from you, which isn't really a business anymore, right? Because they have to do their own name, whatever. But what they're buying is the insertion into your network, and this person will be so vetted by you that you go make a personal recommendation to all of these people, hey, this person's gonna take care of you, I'm trying them on this, this, this, this, and this, but you actually don't really even need the reputation anymore out of integrity, you would do a good job, but let's say they didn't, let's say you vetted them wrong, if that bridge is burned, you've got all these other things going on anyway. That's a good question.
00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good point. Yeah. Yeah. and that's the thing that You want, it's not invincibility, but it's, you want to be shielded from whatever can go wrong or if you're making the risk, it's a educated and it's an educated risk where you're, you've got everything coming. So you've got Delta when you've got QME and, well, no, I know, but I'm at July goes.
00:43:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah. So, and I'm sure that other things are going to present themselves, um, as you, as you, as you go.
00:43:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:43:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, especially with whatever related to, like, if you get into the ultrasound stuff for, for Alzheimer's, first of all, that information needs to be so much more widely spread because it's such a big deal, like we lose people. Um, New, but the knowledge and the science behind it for the most part isn't new. It's just we found the missing piece and nobody knows about it yet. And it needs traction. And the other thing that we know is that government, health care, pharmaceuticals, whatever, we're going to do their best to keep that down because drugs are big money, sick people are big money. So you've got these two different competing markets. You have a great way to to to to I don't serve and leverage in there.
00:45:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we actually hope that this, you know, this price point, we can actually lower it in the coming years. We think that the MRI bills will be lower next year, you know, just because every year the price seems to come down a little. So hopefully this, you know, we'll start to be able to offer this at like $2,000, for instance, every year. So like you're saying, hopefully this diagnostic piece will get cheaper every year. And then, you know, you pair that with the technology like treatment, like all just sound, that'd be really cool.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can they use like a health savings account for this?
00:46:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have to apply through government, but yes, you have to get a tag.
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the two things I would try to do would be to get that as quickly as possible. Because you want to remove friction from anybody who wants it as much as possible. So they can use, especially because entrepreneurial type people, if they don't have the insurance, we'll have HSA's because this probably wouldn't cover it in most insurance anyway, depending on what kind of diagnosis they had to begin with. And then the other thing is a payment plan. So there are lots of different services that you could sign up for that would give you a payment plan. And those two things right there are going to help remove some friction points right away. And then the other thing about a higher price point is that it allows you to offer like referral discounts. So refer a friend and you know, they say $500 or you say $500 on your next one or that type of thing. And you still preserve solid margins, but you know, that's the whole thing about marketing. They have the feeling that they've saved money. And the fact that they can't go get it anywhere else serves you a very good purpose right there.
00:47:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I like that. Yeah, I just asked Chat TPT to show me how to register my business to accept HSA after spending, like for Christmas time, that might be a good thing.
00:47:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of year. Yeah, I love that. And do you have targets? So you should talk to Mark and see if he thinks that you and Dan might be a good match. Dan doesn't just take everybody really what he does is he builds the websites. And the reason for that is because the speed, he needs to control the assets so that we can get really clean data. And that's, he built this whole thing for that purpose because it's really hard to get accurate tracking, but ads don't work very well if you don't have accurate tracking. So, he does that and he just likes puzzles and he, but he's very good at running Google ads in a way that almost nobody does. It's very low cost. So, anyway, it's interesting like when I first told Mark about this business, I actually, because you see how much I can afford to spend on this.
00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was actually, I actually went to Mark and said, know, should I hire someone to do my website, hire someone to do my marketing. And I thought Mark was going to say like, yes, yes, and he actually made me think about it a little differently that like, what is your business really? And so this business to me was like, it's really just a marketing play, right? I'm not, I don't own the brain scanner. don't own the game. the report maker, the brain key report maker, I'm just the reseller. And Mark was saying, you know, you should have at least a beginning understanding of how to create a website, create a payment processor, and also how to, you know, run a base Google ads because he's like, he was telling me like, he can't tell me how many millions he's freelessly spent on. That's exactly why right there. And he said, like, once you, you know, once I figure it out, when I run a couple campaigns, then I can go out and hire, you know, really cool people. But he's like, you need to understand the core of your business. And I was like, okay, so yeah, that was actually that was my plan is to actually run, you know, one campaign, maybe put $10,000 in it and run it on Alzheimer's.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so I understand. You know, want to tell that was funny.
00:49:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, so that's not even that.
00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's why I wouldn't recommend anybody but Dan. And he is not the best. at creating the campaigns. He is the smartest when it comes to conserving money. The thing about all advertising agencies are they are, you will bleed out the jugular.
00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's how bad they are.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark is right because when you understand the technicality of what's involved and they want to give you a $10,000 a month fee, you're going like for what? For why? No. Now if you want $10,000 and you got me a million dollars. Okay. Right. Or you know what I mean? Or even $100,000. 10% marketing fee is totally accessible. But most of them are just ridiculously priced and you have no concept of it. Most people have no concept of it because they've never done it. So now you have, and Mark would tell you if he thinks it's, I would be curious to know what he thinks.
00:50:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I haven't run the campaign yet. I'm probably going to try to do that next week.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yes, you should. that everybody that does business for themselves should know a little bit about all the things really should. And the reason I have the business I have is because I did all the things. I've done graphics, I've done web design, I've done programming, I've done building the products, I've taught, I've done all the things. And so when I go with somebody, what's that?
00:51:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, hold on. I was saying, yeah, I think that's a great idea to talk to some of Mark's contacts. Once I run my first campaign to try it, I like it.
00:51:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we keep kidding.
00:51:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like, it keeps coming out and I don't know if it's my internet or yours. Oh, I think I need to stop the share here. There we go.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.
00:56:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so maybe I'll just target July. So because now for July, I have quarter one and quarter two. I actually wait, are we done with quarter? So two quarters of data. So we can look at that.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we'll be almost done.
00:56:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I can get the monthly P&Ls and then you wanted quarterly P&Ls. Yes. Okay, maybe we'll start.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want the whole year and then I want quarterly. Well, July, I would like monthly.
00:56:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I'll get it since January and then we can go over those next call.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds good. So, physician, physician, oh my God. Physician recruitment, why my tongue does not want to work. Um. I want to know, um, let me see how much you've given me already. I want to understand. Entry the exit for your money, like how do you earn the money? You've told me some about it, but I want to know what that if there's any leverage point, if there's anything that you can do to increase that, let me, let me start with that. Do you think that there's anything that you can do to increase that?
00:57:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can talk about ester stuff if you want to medical director. I want to understand deeply like, explain what that is and how the money comes to you. And then also we talked about your training. Um, Q and D like test prep, I think is what it was. And, um, we started getting data on that. And what I. I had asked for was, I wanted one spreadsheet that had the overall snapshot kind of data for each of those businesses, which is the revenue month over month, as long as you've been doing that particular business, and that would incite questions for me that I can start asking you, but I really need to be able to see that revenue and know a little bit in terms of like where it comes from. So the assignment and I would like to install the there's a repercussions for not doing it next week, because it would be a waste of our time if you don't have this we're we shouldn't it should have already been done. Is that I want that and I need to make sure that you're clear because I did ask for it before. And you can tell me if you get too busy or something like that, but I want revenue for every type of the business, so you gave me I'll just list them one more time. All right. right. All right. right. All right. All Physician Recruitment, Medical Director, and the licensing exam test prep. I want to know the revenue month over month from each of those, a description in the same spreadsheet of how you make that money. What do you have to do to get it and any kind of information that you can think of as to what you might be able to do to increase it? All of those before we meet next week and I want it, we're meeting Monday. I want to Friday. It's Friday. Wait, wait. It's Thursday. Okay. That's not fair. You're lucky. All right, you can have it by Monday morning and we'll just go into by then because I wanted to go over it, but I'm not going to work on the weekends. I got the girls this weekend, so we'll just do it Monday. So if you're prepared with all of that, then we will have a good day.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
call. Oh, sounds great.
01:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Should I keep putting time into this delta thing? Or do I need to put that on the back word?
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it light you up?
01:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I really like doing it. But you know, I see the money that I can make with July like we talked about and refinements to the QME. I could be better at that.
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's the thing about creators and visionaries. We don't usually stay on one thing really well for long without feeling frustrated, annoyed, irritated. You have to have some freedom to go other places. These are existing businesses that you've already defined and chosen. Now, if you want to say you want to go chase something else that isn't even on your plate when you've got all these things going on, like what are you doing? Stop. Focus. But it's already here that you're already doing it. nurturing it would be good. once we get to the activity, that I'm talking about and we have evaluated all of your income strains and then chosen which ones have the most leverage and then made a plan for it. Then you need to try to stay within the bounds that we've created but those boundaries don't exist right now so you know and we don't have any reason or logical placement to put boundaries in so if you've got time and you're not neglecting other duties then then explore it but you should be mindful of you know sleep routine and hygiene and family that's the only thing I would always say no matter what we're talking about. That's fair all right that's good and dirty all right it was awesome talking to you foodie hello Esther I know it's your time but I really like that and makes me happy so thanks for letting us say hi. Yes you're great all right thank you.
01:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay bye have a great night.

Hi Tina.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, how are you?
00:00:05 - Laura L
Doing well yourself.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good kind of all over the place, but not in pain this time.
00:00:11 - Laura L
So that's good.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You feeling better?
00:00:15 - Laura L
Yeah, feeling better now.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. It's been a couple of weeks since we've spoken.
00:00:23 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go to, no, that's the wrong one. Oh. So something that happened since the last time we spoke is that active campaign, which was what I was going to use for a CRM, like tripled their prices and have made some changes and somebody created a high level snapshot for communities that looks a lot like school. so I think that. But I think I'm not positive. may say we think Epic. I'm in the middle of conversations with clients here.
00:01:16 - Laura L
I'm sorry, looks like you're cutting out. You're back. You're cutting out.
00:01:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm cutting out.
00:01:35 - Laura L
Yeah, you're back now. Oh, I did say the last.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All I said was no. I was responding to somebody. My client is trying to talk me into not thinking about the membership. site before I actually have stuff to put into it. I'm like, that's not how my brain works. I understand that logically, that's what makes sense and that's how it should be. But I want to eat home to put stuff into me, like, but you're not selling the home, you're selling the furniture, I'm like, it doesn't matter. We're not going to argue my brain is my brain is my brain is my brain. So anyway, but it's the nickname invites to use GHL rather than thinking of fake. Yes, I I'm super distracted because all these things are happening. I hate frogs. He said eat the frog. I said I hate frogs.
00:03:05 - Laura L
Do you know that book eat the frogs? No.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Anyway, so let me show you. I don't know. Oh, so yeah, let me just show your screen. My stuff. Still trying to talk me into being smart. I'm not going to do it. I don't be smart. be Tina. Okay, let's see. He's the one that showed me the snapshot. Where did I just go? Which I sleep for right here. Oh, not that company. just company it on me. Now my staff, I don't play you all right? Laurel?
00:04:08 - Laura L
Yeah. What was that? I suppose to help you with the email.
00:04:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:23 - Laura L
Two, five, eight.
00:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The Gmail?
00:04:27 - Laura L
Yes, correct.
00:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And settings. I want to give you a pause when you can figure that out. User permissions. I'm going to pretty much everything. we'll just give you everything for now. That way. Hopefully you, it doesn't trigger. Um, like you can, you don't need two factor authentication. for me like you don't have to yeah get a quote from me yep so let me so I don't have to go on I suppose my video that'll that'll help let me stop video there that'll hopefully will help the bandwidth can you hear me okay yeah I can hear you okay okay um yeah so um but the the thing the reason I like high level though is also because of all the texting follow up that you can do and we're really pretty much sure in this but I just started started working with another lady and we're really gonna collaborate and help each other get some stuff done so I'm excited about that I really don't have Much to report at this moment other than I wanted to tell you that I one way or another will also use high level We might use it with think epic, but I think ultimately we'll end up having a membership site here I don't have the snapshot that I want to use yet, and so I don't know but what I did see I was looking at the Let me go to Tina Maria the aisle to check out.
00:06:28 - Laura L
I wanted to try a different check out.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I don't remember where we got the Elementor checkouts. Oh, no, was funnel kit checkouts Templates Oh And I can't remember which one it was it was like simple or something
00:07:00 - Laura L
I think there's a word wordpress with a final flow. I mean, final kit you could choose from the template with the check out. Um, down in the final kit. Yeah.
00:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All the same stuff, huh? Um, oh, minimalist. I think that was it. Let me look at this for a minute, preview. There was, oh, no, it might have been shop. Oh, this. Okay. Right. I wanted to, um, I like this because it looks kind of like Shopify using colors, but I don't know how hard it is to get Apple Pay in here also, but just being able to make this really simple where they can do and express check out. Like anything that we can do to minimize friction is good. I would need a shipping address so we could just be building a dress if we need it. And this has an order bump. So I like this one. Let me go to see the other one. Probably navigated incorrectly, but. It's. Someone called I want to see what this one does. Oh, yeah, that looks like it too. looks like Shopify. know she's. just take out shipping easily.
00:09:03 - Laura L
Check us as one, two, I think with a minimalist, we could have the option to take out bump order.
00:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I probably will have an order bump. They are very effective. Let me see. Yeah, all of these are two. Oh wait, I'm not specifically in check out what I want to be. I want to have the fastest way for them to pay and be done and I would like multiple steps because let's go with minimal and see what happens if we do three steps. We could, if we turned it to a physical product, which you can't do here, I mean a digital product, then there is no shipping. And so this would go away and it would go proceed to next step, which means we've captured some information. Let's see if we do it. One one step, no shipping, came in the information, place one now, and we can have that word above. Yeah, I would hold on to me. What's the difference between that one and this one?
00:10:35 - Laura L
Oh, yeah, the shipping address. It's on the step one.
00:10:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, if I did three steps. yeah. It's still on step one. Okay. Okay, so I do. Okay, let's see if I did this one step, now that's on there too, but it doesn't matter, so let me look at this one more time. This has an order bump, I don't know if the other one has an order bump and I'm going to do this. Check that page, one click up cell, your order is complete, here is a special offer. Okay, I like that, I didn't look at I'm here, one click up cell, that's pretty good. Let me look at that one click, up page, one click of cell. Let's show which one I like better, honestly. I think that this one would probably convert better. I'd like to see it on mobile. One more time. What I like about this is that it shows the steps.
00:13:35 - Laura L
Yeah.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I like that there's more opportunity to sell them. More spaces for testimonials without a lot of extra work because it's already there. So I want to use the minimalist one. Okay. And four. So. what you could do is we could set up a product and the product will be, let me put it in chat. Oh no it should be, hold on, yeah what do you call it? Trello. I already have it, shouldn't have it open for us but I think we already have the these things.
00:14:28 - Laura L
I mean the product that you created for supposedly in, thank you fit, the 97.
00:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay yeah. No so what I want is a, I think we'll sell it for like seven dollars, the profit time energy maximizer so that this. So create products in funnel kit, which is profit and energy for short. Okay, it's $7 one time they will need. Let's make this a simple community in high level and see how that works. So it will be a little contained. videos, PDFs, basically, and I want to be able to have a follow-up sequence. This is for me kind of a new. I'm working on, I got to finish the script and the videos and my goal is to do that this weekend because I don't have my youngest over this weekend. We've just been so busy with Summer now, so this is like my first actual weekend without any, well, I have one daughter at home, she's almost never home, so that's fine. So follow-up So basically, like, name the sequence creates first email and it's welcome. Thank you. Thank you, here's your access and magic room. That's probably as far as my brain can go for thinking about it. Um, like what's to create at right now. But I think that that gives us a good jumping off start because, um, yeah.
00:17:26 - Laura L
Yeah, you can always add in there. If there's something comes and we'll come up, then we could always use Trello and add some paths in there.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And it's going to become kind of quick because the lady that I'm working with, she's been doing this for 20 years as well. it's just like divine that we found each other, found each other through our client. And we're both kind of like at these crossroads, but it's going to go so much faster because we are doing similar things. But we serve different audiences. And so. That will be great, but also part of what I've been doing, first of all, is figuring out the stack which we've mostly done though it's changing, and the other thing I really needed to do was figure out how I wanted to create and edit videos because I hate being on video, I feel insecure, I don't like that, but also I want the videos to go on multiple platforms and I want them to be able to look good on multiple devices and so just trying to figure out what tools help to edit the videos the quickest and help make them responsive and so that took some research so I've got all of that figured out and then I needed to have my graphics guy lined up and I had that lined up, I've got you lined up so like all my ducks have been put in a row over the summer and now I'm like ready to assemble everything on an assembly line. This is the first time I have been at this point, so remember I was saying like at the end of the summer like I'm probably going to go pretty quick. This is where it should be starting. can't imagine it going slow. is high priority, I've got all the support in place. anything else would be just excuses, and I should not do that.
00:19:14 - Laura L
Yeah, for video, I actually done videos for other clients, but it's in Canva. video page, and I mean promoting also in social media.
00:19:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going to use CapCut and probably use it in combination with Descripts. I'm not sure I have to look and see AI tools, long videos to short. So the combination stack, I think I'll use and I'll put this in Trello too.
00:20:05 - Laura L
Okay.
00:20:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My heck, I can't. I'm looking for this is it. Okay. So to do in progress and I'm going to, I want to create, um, a board. we're going to call this tech stock. Maybe I can't create it. Private board. Upgrade to use. Yeah, going to full. Anyway, so I'll just do this, um, video editing, um, I'll finish with cap cut. Um, and it might start here. not sure I have to make my first one, but cap cut does. Skin smoothing. So all. these high definition cameras like you know how if you take a regular picture I don't know you're very young so you might not know but regular cameras don't like highlight every single thing that's wrong on your face but high definition cameras do and so for me like that filters the just basic ones not like the crazy ones they just make you look like normal because the high definition things just pull out like every freckle every line whatever I get embarrassed I don't want that so I want just a little bit of like this moving so I don't just feel so insecure because I I feel insecure so I have to deal with that um has spinning and just lighting effects let me show you the features of it um you just you just have a lot of like really easy um no It's going to be one or the other. No, I don't want to create an account. Is it login? Yeah. It might have been T-memory systems. Yeah. It's a password. I'm saying, forgot password, reset password. OK. Kind of an email address. OK, I didn't get an account. I guess I thought I did. Anyway, leave this page. Solutions. That's video editor for Video background remover stabilization transcript. Text-to-speech AI voice generator voice changer auto captions add textivity of the effects and filters sound effects it has I don't You can add music really easily to this and then there's the script and Why I might use the script probably first Let me just grips. I just want to find it. No Is it has a I that will Features And just click on features and see everything. No So it does clip creation really good it does I contact it does green screen that removes the background If you wanted to do that for like putting branding in the back a lot of improvements here. The AI contact, so like if you're reading a script and you're not looking at the camera but looking at the camera actually has higher conversion rates, it will fix this. So for sure it's going to be these two because the scripts doesn't do skin smoothing and I look at this camera and I just look at it and I want to crawl under a rock and never put a video out ever. I want to teach people and I know that it's vain but I just feel lovely and I just have it to you. yeah, so these two things and then what was the other one I was thinking of? So there's opus clip and the script does this but I don't, I think opus might do it better. script says they do it better but if you give them a video they will just turn it into very short little reels on all kinds of different forms. And the AI will tell you, this is what this clip is about, and it will score it on an engagement level, like how engaging the content is. So they all do different things really well, and I think that I would probably use them together, and I definitely am going to want to outsource this. So if you have interest in video editing and want more work, that's potentially something that you could do. But yeah, and it will just be something else that you get to learn and know when it may not be skill that you have. If you have interest, if you don't, I can do it. I have another guy that could probably do it and has interest in it too. But anyway, so these words were my trouble again. lost it. I'm always losing trouble. Where's Trello? Do not see it. It's this one.
00:25:55 - Laura L
That does not look like Trello to me. Yeah.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The script, because AI contact, primarily, and I think it was the script that did the formatting automatic multi-cam, I don't think that was it, maybe it was CapCut, AI Tools, Products, electronics distribution, computer experience, video transitions, custom stickers, like that, video to short video, AI Relights, just had it, okay, it was one of these two, anyway that automatically changed, actually I think it was CapCut because I only Um, let's see. cat automatically adjust size of video reframing anyway it made the video super responsive depending on the device and was able to do that everywhere that you posted the video so like you know how Loom has your picture in picture and it's a little circle yeah so it did that and it might have been in the script but then the circle would get bigger or move left or right depending on what I will show you how you can create a website using 3d going objects with I was having to write and in this video we'll talk about how you can change the aspect ratio and you'll see if you can go to the website. Now, somebody had an ad and they showed it on the script in 15 minutes, that would be good. It was an upgrade to one of them and I bought it and I can't remember which one did it. I don't know why they do such a good job marketing it and then you'll be quiet. They don't tell you where to find it easily. But anyway, it was the response of this marketing business market creator. Yeah, so I'll just put this in here. One of these makes super responsive videos. I just the picture in picture and talking head size and placement so like it wouldn't move. Imagine the talking hand is over here on the left but then you go like portrait view for a phone it would move it to the top or to the bottom and then put the video that like the screen sharing part on top or on bottom. So the edge list. Yeah so like Loom won't probably let me use it now because of the camera but yeah so imagine let me change my sharing to my whole screen. Okay so you see this little thing right here. Yeah okay so imagine this is Loom and this is this zoom is my training video okay. Now imagine we're going to portrait size and phone it can make it go like this. Oops. And automatically adjust it and you can change what to do based on the screen size When you set the video, so like it's all coded in there like it's crazy. Yeah We're going go ahead dynamic placement Yes, I mean We're we're used to responsive like Reformating things but generally you don't get to change how the layout appears a whole lot You can and some of them you can drag them drop in and choose, you know, what goes where on the mobile version But you can only do that for one mobile version not for multiple formats and layouts And only for web content not for the talking head in a video So that was a pretty big deal and then Office Multiple video clips single video, multiple views, if there are split screen and multiple speakers, so it can identify papers and then create captions in those clips and AI ranking of the engagement level of content. So if you want to spend any time just looking at those and seeing if that's anything you have interested in or just want to learn for yourself, you can go in there and see what they do, but so that's the growth, that's the evolution this week is there's been shifts, so high level I really didn't want to build there because it's kind of like Frankenstein code, like it's made up of a bunch of different things. But the thing that I realized is that because so many different programmers are building for it, there's so many more options, and there's going to keep being new options like this snapshot that looks just like school, which let me show you. Gotta find the, um, and I'm trying to find messages. Yes. Let me show you this. We started recording to show people what it means to start a business. Is the wrong YouTube account, so it's not my YouTube, right? want to enter your nurtures? Okay, so first of all, they've got all this nurture sequence. Yeah, and. Structured so you can get an idea of the basis. So right here, you've got the discussion tab. This is where all the community posts. They also have leaderboards, though, like school, and you can change the levels. Um, they just have some really cool stuff. And I don't really care about school a lot, but it's familiar to people and some like it. School charges $100 per community, but they have this, like, it's a really good follow up nurture sequence and just just some automations that are built into it. But this is $1,000. So, um, I haven't bought it yet and I'm just like looking at the options. But because I'm realizing people are building stuff like this where I can just buy it and install it into high level and do it like a one time cost, where as like, if I work with, like, think if it or anything else, basically I'm limited to whatever upgrades they deem worthy, whereas in high level, any brilliant person could go create something and sell it and I can get it, you know, yeah, right, right, so and I can customize things. So I think that it just provides me more opportunity and also like I get excited about the tech stuff and that kind of energizes me and is fun. So I do want to work with it and build it in it and yeah, anyway, so identify the video tech stack decided I'm going to use high level and working with somebody else who's going to help make all of this go faster and that's pretty much it for right now.
00:34:41 - Laura L
Yeah, and I also asked for the link of that YouTube video so I could also like on.
00:34:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to drop it in zoom for you right now?
00:34:52 - Laura L
Oh yeah, sure, I could quickly grab it.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you can't copy and paste it there. Oh, I can put it also in here, video editing. Let's see, not this one.
00:35:09 - Laura L
Yeah, I got it.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Uh, yeah. Really cool things people are doing. So, um, there's not really a specific assignment other than what we have here. This creates the one thing. Oh, yeah, I create this. Um, you have any questions about this?
00:35:54 - Laura L
Um, how much? I said that. Okay, got it. And I think we have to, um, sort of. out the domain again, because it's not our I mean, oh, yeah, um, we might have to redo. Yeah, in the record.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do want to go with my old domain, which is my freedom systems, and that would not be a subdomain. But what we do need to know and what I do need you to get from Presidium is how do we configure subdomains with namecheap. Okay, don't know if that's a task. So we'll do this. Ask Presidium for how to create subdomains using as registrar. Also make sure all SSLs are set up and working.
00:37:16 - Laura L
Okay.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it for this Okay. All right. Well, then we will meet next week and just feel free to send me any questions or updates that you might have.
00:37:37 - Laura L
Okay. Sure. We'll do. I'll send you a message in Slack. would be a great.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:43 - Laura L
would be great.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if it's related to the project, like one of these tasks, put a comment in here and I don't know. Can I do? Can we tag? Yeah, we can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that would actually be better because then it's. in there and with the conversation stays with the task. like breaking on the task and go like, what does she say?
00:38:06 - Laura L
Then it's right there. Yeah, we can always go back.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:38:11 - Laura L
Okay, yes, that was great.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I'll get an email notification and also I have the trouble app. So I should get a push notification as well.
00:38:20 - Laura L
Okay, that sounds great.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. I'm excited. got so much work to do, but I'm super excited.
00:38:27 - Laura L
Okay, me too.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay! Okay, I'm so glad you're feeling better. And I look forward to talking to you next week.

> 2024-09-17T20:00:00Z 00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hey, Patrick. 00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) How are you doing? Good. How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over. I will nag mark for the report again. He did this emoji. 01:03:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Good luck. Have a great day. I'll talk to you next week. Good to see you. You too. Bye-bye. Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Well, I'm talking back to you realize mine was muted, and I know I unclicked it, but then I was in the wrong meeting, and so I forgot the second time.
00:00:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Can you hear me now? Dan? I hear you, I hear you. Hey, about now? Oh, I think I can do this. I hear you. Does that make it better or worse?

Can you hear me?
00:00:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
nothing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is it doing nothing? I hear you.
00:00:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hear you. wait. No, I can't do that. Well, that is a good work. Do... this.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you hear me now?
00:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.

It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, Mark. You're crazy. That's exactly what he ate.
01:07:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, your employees are gonna actually have to do tasks, weekly, gasp.
01:07:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, that is the issue. Anyway, okay. That is awesome. I forget what you realized you figured out, but I know you figured it out, and you won't forget when it comes to what you figured out was supervised.
01:08:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, do you mind? Yeah, totally. I need to build our own.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, because I can go back to my notes and get that if you need a reminder.
01:08:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I got it.
01:08:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, sir. Okay, don't forget ideas for like a gift basket. That's pretty much going to be all about Denise. We'll probably figure out something for you too.
01:08:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, It's the other D&D call.
01:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got two air pods and you probably drop them in the dog bowl.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, but they're the ones that everyone's complaining about. No, actually, that's already broke.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm on another set.
01:08:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mary is using the ones that you got using the one.
01:08:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's one that works.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't think I dropped them in the dog bowl. eat the pieces of a shelf. I told that to Josh amazing. Oh, I just got air pods and like be gentle.
01:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't forget to think about the Denise basket and then, you know, have a great weekend, Labor Day weekend.
01:09:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, thanks. Oh, I think all the music I get canceled, maybe I'll probably all of them, except Mark.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
01:09:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I meant. I don't, I don't, yeah, yeah.
01:09:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not coming that way.
01:09:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God. I mean, it's a base. It's a basis meeting, but it's really not inviting you, but yeah, totally. Okay. You know, I'll be late.

Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.
01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, cool.
01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.

00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on?
00:00:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We have the Washington Bar Company, the New Mexico lawsuit in Bar Company. Tyler potentially missing the statue. Tyler slash Nate slash cat. Potentially missing the statue. Friday getting an earful from Sweet James because they also signed the client of ours and got mad that we were trying to write their name when that wasn't the case, so we're hearing that out at 12 today, but that's a minimum $200,000 loss for me, which sucks. It is what it is. And we kind of like... The survey cases that are relatively new, email us, tell us that they don't want to be represented in. And what about HQ intake? We're still sending our leads to HQ intake and they're going to us, so we're doing double work. So it's just getting the point where it's a lot.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, what's good?
00:01:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, great to have a big check last month. That's always good. We've signed up a good number of cases last month, despite having a lot of drops and subouts, so that's still good. We put together a new incentive plan that we rolled out to the staff, so it should be good. Obviously, it costs us money, but hopefully we'll get everyone incentivized to try to get the goals together. Oh, I took a new job with a pain doctor, so that'll be good for her. And yeah, that's what I got.
00:02:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me about the incentive plan, and is that going to increase payroll?
00:02:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. By about 15 grand a month.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A percentage is that.
00:02:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Payroll or.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Total so payroll was around 37% what's it now?
00:02:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

What's, what's changed in the structure?
00:08:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They hit both money angle and settlements, it's a thousand of each person. If they want hit one of them, it's 500.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the stats on hitting those goals across the teams.
00:08:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It hit it three or four months this year. It's not every time, but it's frequent enough that it's not impossible, I guess. It's definitely doable. I think done it multiple times. Thanks
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't think that that's, I think it's a good thing to me. I mean, obviously, you did too because you did it, but that makes sense to me, that I mean, I guess it just depends on how much revenue difference that makes money and goals and settlement.
00:09:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the settlement goal? Three million.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:36 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The logic is not every case that settles you're going to paid out right away, just because it takes We made it clear that the goals will increase over time. Right. We're adding more people. or adding more states, writing more cases, like it's not going to stay this way.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will the payment increase or just the expectations?
00:10:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I think just the expectations because quite frankly, for adding more people and more teams, it's hard to justify increasing the amount per person when we're adding more people. It doesn't make sense.
00:10:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talking to, I assume that you would have had a conversation with your attorneys about this. So wait, let me ask this first of all, in Patrick's team probably won't even have enough to get to those goals. It's a real wide goal. And then the attorneys that are already paying out of pocket for their teams for their incentive program or are they going to Okay, this what?
00:11:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
This is separate from that.
00:11:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What I what I was asking is, would you think that they're going to pull back what they're already doing or keep that the same?
00:11:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I've talked to them and they've all said they're going to keep the same.
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so who does that besides Samantha and Marin's?
00:11:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nick doesn't because it doesn't really make sense given their volume. Patrick isn't on a percentage. So it wouldn't make sense for him to do it and Hank doesn't. Again, a percentage to noon.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. This doesn't take away from them. I wouldn't see why they would do it other than just being short-sighted and thinking that that would be How much do they pay out, do you know individually each month to their teams and internet programs?
00:12:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know exactly. Sam's a little better because she gives part of her quarterly bonus to them. She has 6,000 divided by her team and she'll pull us out like during the month. Tyler is more ad hoc. I think he's probably giving his team a round of grand that total.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so the people I have on Samantha's team is Thelma, Valerie, Victoria, and Jalissa.
00:12:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that still correct? No, Jalissa never wanted, never ended moving over. She made more money doing it and take the script.
00:12:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so does she only have three people?
00:12:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's got Liz helping her a little bit. we've got Liz training with her before that is kind of cool. time would think.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And in what role? Can you send it right?
00:13:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Sure.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Just helping. Yeah. I was Hank doing.
00:13:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, we've got a standing meeting every Wednesday to go through his cases and what's going on. So I talked a little bit on Wednesday last week, um, going through his cases, kind of how these are built. New cases look okay. he's just trying to scrape some of these, you know, crack their cases through. Uh, he had, not a complaint, but, you know, said it was a little tough with him in the same office, even though the office is made for four people. Um, just because sometimes they're working around. each other and we get a little loud if they're both on the phone, so we end up just getting her a separate office. They're on like a scene like what they're near each other.
00:14:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that gonna cost you different?
00:14:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
600 bucks a month. It's not enough to worry about to keep two people happy. I would agree. One thing he did say, which I did find interesting and was actually kind of also anyway, he said that clients have been showing up to the office, like they want to come in more. And so I was talking to Steve, he's like, yeah, our Phoenix office, like clients love to come in. Like it's weird, no other place they do that, but in the Phoenix area they love to come in. So, I think longer term is actually a good thing having a Phoenix office, so it should help us with retention and hopefully with the hurdles.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or be more of a bottleneck because it slows things down and people get more chatty. That be interesting to see if there's less sub-out or if there's more referrals from the Phoenix office from previous customers, things like that, would be really interesting to see how, what the correlations are to anything, very interesting, so let me go look at this. Pink's not even on the team, and I look at matters by team, hold on, yeah, that's this year.
00:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we started to give them about one or two new cases a week.
00:16:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first thing you said before giving one or two?
00:16:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You have some because it's getting one or two weeks, so it definitely has cases.
00:16:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. Screen to real quick. So this is one of the newer reports that. Did he actually say is the newest report I think. So I don't know how accurate this is or. it was made from zoom out of the way more. Okay, so these are the teams, it's finding, how would I see what criteria this report is using? If I edit, maybe.
00:17:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And it's probably not going to the resolution closed because he's just starting to get his own cases.
00:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, let's see, okay, so it probably just wouldn't even be in here.
00:17:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Also, it looks like he doesn't have his own matter team as he's principal, so I'll talk about that.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh. Got that.
00:17:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, if you wanted to, like, map.
00:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
as a report?
00:18:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, just letter in general.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, sorry, where do you mean?
00:18:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's home, chatter. Oh, yeah.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:18:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then I recently viewed if you just click where it says you're telling you to left.
00:18:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:18:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then just type in hang. Yep. You can see his list.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So he's got a 50. And status, no.
00:18:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, they're not using that thing. Progatory was what was supposed to be for soccer to take a look at.
00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just think it's funny.
00:19:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
the file but the offers aren't good enough to take so it's okay.
00:19:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, just making it this. I haven't like did this report like this before so that was interesting. All right, so we can probably stop screen sharing and hey, have you heard from Fuji today?
00:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Today?
00:19:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, he, oh, okay, he slept through his alarms.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He missed my call, so.
00:19:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you baby. Yeah, I'm not mad about it. figured I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something bad. So, you know, mean, new babies are something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We talked to him again because he got his car. He was doing drier than having fun.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, No, and I heard from him yesterday, but he he messaged that he just messaged. I just thought that he slept through his alarm. So it's okay. I'll check in with him. just want to make sure they were okay. So, um, okay, so new incentive program. That's good. You about how are I said, how are you doing? And you're like, okay, body blows, all that stuff. overall, really, how do you feel Um, trying to think of how to formulate that question right now, it just feels little demoralizing, right?
00:20:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's just like, you keep pushing and pushing and pushing and Definitely feel like you're moving backwards to some level. What's the point of doing all this stuff and having all this stress when it's just, you know, making progress? Um, it sure lives. I'll get over it. It's just All I want
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, comes in waves like that's exactly right that's exactly right. So, um, I mean, that's, that's perfect. That's just, did I tell you we had another accident? My, my daughter caught in another accident. So we have three, three and three weeks. I'm a place where you can't do any help. Anyway, point being that the craziness, that's exactly how it happens. It's just their seasons, ebbs and flows, and it's wild, but your perspective of, of that, that that that comes and goes being able to recognize that being able to put that into perspective and not let it overwhelm you. I mean, you can't not feel the things you've. can be numb, but that doesn't really serve a good function because then you can't block out specific feelings, you block everything or nothing. I mean, effectively. So just being able to put that into perspective. So last week, hold on, we started talking about that. That's not even the right note, the heck. Um, goals. Did you read Emith again? Or did I ever have you read it? I feel like you said you had read it once before.
00:22:53 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's two books.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Emith I have. not read not So, you still have it?
00:23:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I already, I haven't had a chance to read it yet.
00:23:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And you can just say that for like what I'm traveling, it's just easy to, you know.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you have a target for when that can happen? Probably next week. Because I'm traveling next week. And when was the last time you read EMIS?
00:23:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's been a while. I just remember there's like an entrepreneur, the manager and the technician. And like you can be all three, but really focus on one of them. And become good at it and make sure you have the other two.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go find mine and remind myself.
00:24:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
is about like the person who wants to like know more. So the person who like works on your business instead of in your business, is always big.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to go to my librarian. It's been a while since I read it, too, in that way. And it's always interesting, though, too, that people pick different things out of books. Now I'm trying to remember where I'm going to find my notes, though. where we landed on just talking about the goals, although I think where you want to go with your business and that's not solidified and we talked about purpose a little bit and then I asked you some questions. let me go back to that because that was offline so I didn't put it in my notes and I need to. And you did not reply back to me. So I asked, what did you think about those two things that I mentioned?
00:25:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Yeah, that was better than people. It's just a short answer.
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is it?
00:26:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Dogs are better than people.
00:26:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't hear you disagreeing. Okay, so I mean dogs can be your purpose. That's not a judgment. I just am looking for specificity. And I would like you to work on that and generally the reasons that will resist specificity around purpose will be internal judgment or fear of external judgment.
00:26:54 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't want someone else to go through what I went through and if they have to to have the easier route than what I wonder. It's really what it comes down to. So these are good people generally speaking who want to make the world a better place and they have skills and talents that I don't have. And so if I can bring something to it to connect these things and to help, then it's what I want to do.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you realize what you're prioritizing there? That it's not dogs.
00:27:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It is to some level because it's the overall goal. These are the people that I would need to be able to get the outcome that I'm looking for.
00:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'm missing something then. Oh, let me go like this.
00:27:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
If you're trying to build a technical project, right? You'd want someone who's like a CTO. or someone who has a technical background, generally speaking, if you're trying to build some sort of new technology. In this situation, that would be the surgical vet or Sayaka for like better term.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, these are actually the two. So, of dogs, speaking of dogs. No, I missed my beach on so, oh, no, can't talk about that.
00:28:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll cry. I'm feeling. So, again, for me, if it's a way to help, and all these people come together because they have a skill that I don't have to try to get. it's the outcome that I want. Well, still, you know, there's advantages for me, right? There's tax advantages for the potential business that there's other things going on. It's not pure altruism. But, you know, the main motive here is not necessarily to make as much money as it possibly can for me.
00:29:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I was just trying to sort though because there are two things that in what you were sharing with me is there having dogs that longer lives and have, you know, better quality lives, but also just because of what dogs give to people. the greater purpose to you is just, and this is not when I say just I don't mean it as a judgment at all. The primary focus would be on dogs. People take care of dogs so they don't get better quality lives unless people are taking care of them. the people are just kind of the means to an end and the end is just the best life for a dog. Yes, do I? Okay, um, yeah. So, and here's another question I haven't asked you about. What other businesses do you have the side suite? besides this, besides what you're doing with Fuji?
00:30:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's it.
00:30:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What is your interest in July medical?
00:31:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I work with them. like them. think he's a good person, but that's really it.
00:31:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean. So. There because it makes you happy to be there. Like working with them.
00:31:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I like them. good people.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm just looking at again, this is no judgment. There's just like trying to figure out. So back to the business is ran by the person. What motivates you? does your time go? Like we haven't talked about time in a long time. We haven't really just, you know, kind of. um, broken down, like you, what you're doing specifically versus just sweet law. And if your time is going to other places, if your priority is elsewhere, or, um, one of the things that I like to look at is where can one action benefit multiple things, um, so just kind of trying to take everything to account. So how much time do you feel like you spend on July medical?
00:32:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Can we separate out July medical versus who do you think?
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100% and our conversations have nothing to do with those conversations.
00:32:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I understand. I'm just saying there's a large difference. July medical less than 1% of my time. Okay. Like, Hey, You know, there's the issue with the client or something else would be the only thing that comes up, but it's it's super rare. So it's not often Fuji I talked to I don't know four or five times a week Yeah, we just talk about everything I know he's had some business ideas for I stuff once my body like with record stuff Things in general. So, you know, I definitely spend A couple hours and we just talk to him, but I don't really think of that as business per se Yeah, that just sounds like friendship.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, okay Sweet lot how much time do you think you spend working on that?
00:33:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We haven't done any time tracking or So I spent a lot of time thinking about the business A lot Things are going in problems, efficiencies, in efficiencies, in efficiencies, and efficiencies, know, partnerships do we need? What are we lacking? What are we doing well? can we push? lot of time, obviously, on the financial side of what's our cost requisition, what's our end outcome, where are these numbers looking and that type of thing. But I would say it's been the vast majority of my week, you know, we're just working on one. You know, I say vastly, I would say 65 or 70 percent of my, like, weeking, getting a stinking out of it.
00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On a scale of one to ten, you think about, because I kind of want to rank two different things. And I probably could formulate these better over time, but I'm trying to make a distinction between values. So, what I'm what I'm digging for is how much kind of joy and fulfillment and just value you feel like you get out of the business versus and separate from the level of success that you think that it has. Do you understand a little bit? It's not really and clear that I'm a little bit.
00:36:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, try to put it this way. Starting this, I never had an expectation of being in this position, so I am incredibly grateful and thankful for where I am. The other part of me constantly wants to push the envelope for better force. And so that is always my struggle because there's part of the tail wagging the dog, trying to grow, but we've got to catch up to where our growth's going to be. But at the same time, the question always comes up, okay, so what is the plan? What is next? Where are you trying to get to? I rarely ever have an answer. Sure to remind, I certainly can belong to my doing this. Okay, this business gives me the best chance to make the most amount of money. I don't know what else we'll do. That would give you the same opportunity. I see the cases as a piggy bank for lack of a better term. They're there. They're worth a lot. And so, you know, that's there. I have a lot more flexibility than when it first had when I started this room. Obviously working for someone else. So, you know, I don't want to show up. I don't have to. There's nothing that I have to do. But along with that comes more responsibility, right? So, when the fan, you're the one who's responsible for it at the very, very, very end of the day. So you put in safeguard, you've been processes, but as we grow. As systems break as didn't happen that we wouldn't necessarily expect to more just quite frankly the nature of the business Didn't Mexico lawsuit barfing it's not really anyone's fault. It was just an on the other side. It just is what it is I have to get more used to it because we've had a fairly straightforward run and Or that is some Really easy going and I'm not gonna step over dollar or such trying to pick up pennies Yeah So if You just had All the money that you wanted and didn't have to work Would you work? Yes on what I don't I still think I'll be back here trying And Do the same thing that I'm doing now you know, seeing people be able to buy their houses or get married or, you know, a house to build in their lives because of this is, you know, rewarding. But sitting on a beach, sitting in a drink, it's fun for like maybe a month, but to be bored pretty quickly. But, you know, if you're like, you have all the money in the world, would I go be like a VC or something? Maybe that would be more interesting, you know, helping solve business problems. Trying to figure out how to help people with their issues and problems in a business setting to help them grow and get them where they want to get to.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually think that you would love that. I don't think that you're there yet, but I think that you would serve there really well. think that it would tick all the boxes for you. and I see that as a huge potential in your future. Personally, I was asking the question. That's what I was thinking about. So that's helpful that there is no needed off-ramp that ultimately, as long as you have autonomy over your time and the place that you work, the energy, the vibe, the structure, that you're willing to pay the price of of liabilities and management and leadership, which obviously, um because you value leadership. So that's helpful when we when we take these approaches because sometimes when you um you know when you're in in the more aggressive mode then we got to do better we got to do this we got to do that whatever the the motivators behind it the drive behind it helps to keep that in perspective. So I'm like that I'm very I'm I call it bull energy because I'm like I will plow through things and get everything done and just to help with consequences but that's not really the truth like that's the energy that comes forth is that you know I'm gonna drive through no matter what but but I always have other things keeping me in check and uh it's just usually more than most people are used to because I'm intrinsically the powerfully driven and motivated, nobody and no theme slows me down, nobody and no theme can infiltrate my goals, my perspective, my values, I guess, all of those things. So, and some days I feel them stronger than others and so, you know, whoever's around is gonna feel it and that's the conversation that comes out but that doesn't mean that just because I'm like, let's go today that I that I've failed to take into account all of the other things or that I'm gonna be, you know, mad and just want to count them all everything because we don't go as fast as I want it to and that's the thing that I've picked up about you but I'm just trying to make sure that I Understand that because I feel like I understand it way better now than in the beginning in the beginning it felt Potentially potentially not necessarily incongruent but opposing values and Now that I understand you better. I think that it's more of energy that ebbs and flows and Because of that sometimes it feels more present than others and things like that. So and and all of this affects pace and In terms of how much to push certain types of things because we can push things But sometimes at at detriment to the business. So For example, we went really really hard on these inventors and and we got a whole bunch of cases and then for a while the team was really stressed and overwhelmed but then that kind of seemed to have balanced out a little bit. You know what though, one thing I would like to look at although I know it's not very high is we're just wondering what the sub-out rate was and I wish that we could have a finger on the pulse of just overall job satisfaction like maybe even monthly that we could kind of watch as the lead volume increases and we get closer to capacity anyway I gotta figure out how to because we have the Lidify dashboard for some things but some of the things that we talk about and try to track aren't things that are in Lidify like that like the MPS scores like the the overall feedback which we've only gotten what your end financial slash time goals are. What I would want to do potentially once a month or figure out some way because at least probably, I mean anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of our calls are not damn related. So I don't know how we would segment it but and this is up to you and you get to choose what your priority is and what you feel like is most valuable to you but what I would like to do is spend a little bit more time on the overall approach for what you're doing with business. How like for Dan, he's got two main focuses and probably because money has not ever been an issue. His CPA exam, another 71 has always been since I've worked with him so profitable. that there's never been a, um, that this really not a focus of the conversation. It's more like, that's a whale, whale machine.
00:47:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
How do we just keep that going?
00:47:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the other conversations have been really important. And that is, he wants to do cool things with cool people and he needs to be solving puzzles. So like, he may want to retire, but if he did, his puzzles would be music, making music. And so that would be his thing. And so everything that we do in terms of the other aspects of the business that we look like, we'll look at kind of run through that filter of what keeps him happy so that him. Because when he's happy as everything else works well and is more efficient, then he's better at leading and the cool things with cool people means that not cool people and not cool things have to get. out and there was a lot of that that had to be done. were lot of things that really didn't match his values and what he wanted. So anyway, but for you, dogs being so important, so special to you, and knowing that being human beings in life that more hard things will come up, being able to be intentional, organized, structured, strategic around that type of goal and just kind of lending some help to that if you're interested in it. I would like to do that because I feel like the natural consequence of that is sweet law is going to be better for it.
00:48:48 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I hear so much you're saying. You do, I'm sorry, would you say?
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. Okay, because I think it'd be happier, but the natural consequence of that is more creativity. There's scientific studies that oxytocin boosts creativity, boosts productivity, but the creativity part is really important because to me, your success in sweet life is about innovation. It's that you do things differently. You've always done it differently from the time it took over. And so if getting to spend time purposely, intentionally, consistently, weekly towards this passion project that also has the ability to be profitable, that also has the ability to potentially get you in position where you could be a venture capitalist and maybe an angel investor or maybe a startup counselor. consultant in maybe having an incubator company. I think that, I just think that creates almost kind of like a moat. Well, so we talked about the financial moat around your business. I think this is like an energy moat around the visionary, around you. Okay. So, um, and I know we're getting short on time, but this is what, okay, so let me just thinking about time. I still want to know what the heck Mary's husband is doing, because just keeps going. It's awesome.
00:50:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, you've been going and we're growing it slowly but surely, and I don't mind putting more money. into it if you keep getting the same type of results, right?
00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so also though, let me look at my calendar, because I would like to spend a little bit of time talking to you and why I say a little bit, it's probably at least 30 minutes to an hour about what I'm learning from Patrick and Lauren's. And then is that my smoke alarm? I really hope not. I've been battling those things, changed all of their batteries, reset them all. Yes. But I'm on a call. It's been oh my gosh, unplug them all. don't care. I'll call somebody. Yeah, it will not rip. But yeah. Yes please thank you. Okay so anyway that's something in my eye. So one of the things that I okay so so the unique thing about your business is that you don't have to be in the office and you're hardly around. That sounds wrong but anyway I don't know how much oversight there is and that that's unique to your business for me and I don't know how much of a limitation that is. It's okay so anyway that just means a customized approach to how you do the business because your value is that autonomy and being able to do what you want to with your time and and then creating the best business that you can within within within within those prime which then leads us back to the multiplier concept, which is create better leaders inside of Sweet Loss, so that you don't have to be, and so you don't have to be there, and they're just doing their jobs well, and you're basically just kind of the overseer and almost a consultant to these mini businesses inside of your business. That's kind of how I think matches in aligned with the things that you've told me about what you value. So then if I get to talk with these two business owners, one of them being new, almost like mini franchises inside because they have different offices, different teams, pods, things like that, just figuring out how you can do that, figuring out a system. that supports you not having to be there a lot and continual growth and improvement. So, what does that look like in terms of meetings with them or kind of training just what we're doing? Like, I feel like they're still not really walls in an outline of what that could look like, but it feels like it's coming into view a little bit. So, but our Monday calls, we do cover a lot. So, you said, I feel like you said third.
00:54:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, you can't do Thursdays, right? So, I can, yeah.
00:54:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Not this Thursday, of course, but some Thursdays.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And next week, my Thursday is full. And then we capture that.
00:55:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I Here's a, I have to suffer and go driving courses with some one between 1230 and 230.
00:55:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark, poor Mark, I'm so sorry.
00:55:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's very difficult.
00:55:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you, now if you, um, to take a dog with you, that would even be more terrible.
00:55:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Um, I don't think the dog wouldn't like that. So you're, you're, getting thrown around the car pretty good.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, tiny cars. Yeah. Um, okay. How is Ronan, by the way, because somebody just never sent me pictures anymore.
00:55:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So really. Yeah, no, I spent most of my Sunday with him. Uh, he's really into the Olympics. He loves to watch it.
00:55:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, hilarious. That is hilarious.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But yeah, he's, he's a big boy. He's, he's a little dog though, which is really problematic.
00:55:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are your Tuesdays?
00:55:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Uh, Tuesdays are usually fun.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how about Tuesday? at 13th. Next Tuesday.
00:56:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, should be fine.
00:56:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and 10, 11.
00:56:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's definitely pretty wide open. So what will three in?
00:56:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's make it this time. 11. I like mornings to be productive, like, use my brain, before I start talking. Speaking of using my brain, it does not want to work right now. Okay, Mark, there we go. Sweet. My. Is that for 13th? Yeah, okay. So that will work. And then, okay, so you're going to revisit Emith and rebuild the cell.
00:57:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Well, I read both the cell first and then I'll revisit Emith.
00:57:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I will as well. And then I just have, I need to formulate just kind of a structure. Now, now that I know that we can have some other discussions kind of try to create that call format so that it's productive as it can be. yeah, the goal is just, I think, I guess what I would like is for you to kind of contemplate ponder on what it would look like to be. just if you had interest in it, maybe an investor and consultant. And what do you intuitively feel like that timeline looks like for you? And if you could create this company for, do you have a name for it or anything? You're that vision? Okay. So, just maybe putting a little bit more specificity into it. Dang it, I was what that could look like is it? I mean, because I see so many potential tangents. of creating medical programs that are training for doctors who have an interest in being specialists, trained by specialists, so that somebody doesn't have to fly to Japan to get their dog, you know, help, as well as the dog food. You know, there's so many different components to it where it could be, you're somehow involved in multiple aspects of what can affect dog health from, you know, taking care of the dog with the diet, the food, but also medical, medical care, I mean, even, I don't know, I've calmed down because then my visionary brain kicks in and thinks about all kinds of things. anyway, just ponder it a little bit more. see if you can put any more specifics on to like just let yourself dream the biggest thing and not necessarily say this is not possible this is possible or probable or likely or any of those things and just what like what would you dream about if you just let yourself dream and let's talk about that and then um so yeah there's too much of my head about this right now have to like let's end right now because i gotta make the phone call okay let's do the thing from last week so let's end out okay

That's how I know There you go.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm all sassy on mute. And the word castrated came into my mind.
00:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let me open up my notes and see which one of my faces. Um, what's new this week? What's been going on in the business world?
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I Get ready moon here, okay Eric's gonna be happy about that. He doesn't know it yet, but he's about to know it Talk about weird late not weirdly not weird at all Tina let's face facts my life the the dude I Don't know where I found this guy, but he Frank guy. It's Frank. Yeah, I don't know where I don't know how I Managed to find Frank But I bought his course And I think I went through it Parts of it and then I gave it to Eric and Eric went through it now at the time. It wasn't really contextualized. It was like We didn't have stuff from here yet, so I don't think we'd actually Totally moved in the blocks direction, so it was Maybe a little premature or whatever, but I mean I definitely bought the course before moon year I think I could actually go with that up, but then Eric subsequently gave it to Amishik and DJ like two weeks ago And they started going through it went to them late and then I was like, okay, how do I? You know my thing, you know When I was around complain like oh my new you're so terrible like okay Well, do I how do I solve this and I was like I need someone Like we're 80 90% there I'm like I need someone that could come in and say do this do this do this and I don't even need them to write code because I ultimately To have Eric and Abishik and DJ or whatever to have those guys Write and maintain the code or at least maintain I finish it maybe whatever you want to call it I was like that's the ideal set up so then I found some dude that I don't know and I reached out to him And then I was like, I'm just gonna retuck Frank because I've asked him questions and he's always answered them and of course my other thought is why is no one else thinking of this but whatever so I reach out to Frank write him an email hey man we've got these developers he's like why was I ghosting us but it's completely like the projects on a basic standstill here's where we're at I need to finish it I've got these days and Frank writes me back and his emails like I absolutely do this I can do we can do it two ways we can do it hourly or you can take you can pay for the month and it will work like this we get on a phone call per week I'll do a code review each week make sure they're on track as a matter of fact I did this exact thing for this company and then he's like go check out their stuff and go check out this guy's testimonial and it wasn't even a testimonial which was great it was just a section of a podcast where the guy was getting interviewed and the podcast I started asking him about the development. He goes, oh, well, when it came time to develop this theme, had bought Frank's course and we contacted Frank. And he said, yeah, I can do this with you. And he guided us through, and our developers did it.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh my God, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
00:04:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the theme is so similar to basis in a way. And I'm like, yeah, okay, yeah, you've literally done this. Right. Like, this is great. So he wrote me back today and he's like, yeah, let's do it. I was like, yeah, dude, I'll pay you $1,500 a month. He's like, you said it would take six to eight weeks, depending how busy they are. He's like, yeah, I'll take number in the six to eight weeks. I was like, I love it.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have to keep him. You had a similar kind of beginning with Munir.
00:04:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, this guy is definitely different because he's got this course and he's constantly updating it. Like he's very on.
00:04:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is different.
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and he owns his own agency. Like this guy, he owns a well-known agency. Uh, I think he owns part owner of human design. Um, what? Yeah, I think that's, or does, yeah, I know the name of the agency.
00:05:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I definitely know it. Okay, you know, design is like a, anyagram kind of like thing.
00:05:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, um, it's something, it's something with human in it. I might not give any, it's, or it's designed by humans. It's one another. I don't know. But it's like a high-end agency. And so, but the difference is he's not going to write any code. He's not coding anything. He's just saying, you got to do this. You got to do that. He's like, I'll examine your repo. I'll make sure that all your processes are correct. How they can move forward to maintain the code base. All the things that they action. And I didn't tell him any of that. So, he was giving me stuff they, I've said that they need to get clear on. And he's like, Oh, no, yeah, no, I'll show him to do all of it. And it's exactly what he did for these other guys. And the other guy wouldn't shut up about how great it all came because they had never developed a block at all. They'd never done any block development whatsoever. They went through his course and they started and then they were like, Oh, we need more. We need to make sure that we're like, we need a Sherpa. And so I came in and shurpered them.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:06:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So I'm going get that role in here today, tomorrow.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does Frank's course teach?
00:06:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Block theme develop block and block development.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's definitely on different level of doer.
00:06:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's a teacher. like this dude said, he's the only, it's the only course I've that's, yeah, literally the only one I ever found, and that was, you know, over a year ago, and he's been on it from the beginning, like here. What's also so funny is he sent what the reason I reached out to him is because he sent an email the other day, like, I'm on the list of a buyer. And he pointed out this new feature, I was like, God damn, that sounds exactly like what we need. And then I send it to the guys and they're like, oh, yes, you can do this. That would be perfect. And I'm like, I'm sure we're not using that feature. So he's super duper. He's like up on things like Munir is, but maybe even more so. But the problem with Munir is like, he's just hosting. It's like he's writing the code. So it's like, it's his team. And then he's like, I'm not used to working in this type of scenario. I'm like, I'm pretty sure you suggested this. So why did you suggest that if you're not used to it, buddy?
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But whatever, this is, as the medium told me, Nia was not going to work out of don't trust him. Don't add him to the team. was like, I'm not going to, but I did think he was going to finish the project.
00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was wrong in that regard. Yeah, I mean, it was so close. And yeah, it did not seem like it would go that way.
00:08:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It was so close until it wasn't.
00:08:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So then Eric, I just keep thinking about Eric and his bitterness, but then and then directed at Meneer. But maybe there is, I don't know. So what's the, what's the overall temperature on Eric this week?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They, those three seem to be getting on the same page about stuff.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:08:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
B.J. and Abhishek? Yeah. So they're like, all right, we're going to get all this. So he actually just ran a bunch of stuff by me. was like, yes, he has no, yes. Do it like this. And he's like, OK, perfect, yeah, that's a few. I guess they had a long meeting this morning. So like, and it's just getting things so that like it's very, everything's the same. Like, OK, they're all, it all looks like this. And all that when we build the site, we're going to add these steps up and every time. It's very technical stuff that we've discovered recently because all of these hacks and whatever. Right. And a lot of it's stuff that I was like, we should do this. But I'm saying it in Slack, right? then now they're, you know, Abishik's really good about like compiling everything and then saying, hey, so I guess they met and they're like, all right, this is our game plan, what we're going to do.
00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so Frank, what is Frank doing that's different than what Eric and Abishik and me are going to do?
00:09:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They don't know how to code blocks. Oh, they don't really not not at all, but just like rank and be like, go here, take this path.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, I thought most of the blocks were finished. So how much what blocks need to be finished, what, what is all the blocks are done.
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the main problem right now is the theme. So there's 11 tasks that I sent. So if you first think of it in two pieces, right, basis is essentially two pieces. It's the theme, the base theme, and then basis blocks 2.0 is the blocks plugin. all the issues that Abshek and Vijay are having around building a site are theme based. So they're like, hey, the theme doesn't do this. And then they go look at, they started looking at like 20, 24, which is WordPress's default theme, right? And it's a blocks theme. And they're like, if it's here. or then it could be in ours, we wanted in ours. And then it's that, it's all these like, I mean, I could get into the menu show, but just suffice it to say, it's like theme level code. on the blocks, then it's like, oh, there's a couple things about the blocks. Like one of the layout of such and such a block is off, whatever, but they're like, doesn't matter. It's less, there's less to do there, but what's really holding up like, building wolf reciting are theme related things.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, I thought Norio built the theme.
00:11:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nope.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cause I thought- He built the old one, but he has not been involved in the, so blocks require a block theme.
00:11:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. can't have, you can't have a classic theme.
00:11:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Norio built the He built the original basis theme and the child theme when you were like bootstrapping all that.
00:11:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. It's hard to like it's not like it's not that I can't comprehend a lot of it on the technical level It's that you have the conversation.
00:12:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So rarely like I can't remember And and I understand the details of it without asking some more questions and I wanted a little bit more about You were right. He did. He just did build this one. Okay, and like and the way things work now is like Completely different. That's why these guys are like how do we do this and Frank will be like It's here.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know because you started it and then they built out a Gutenberg and you're like but the Everything but but that's the thing everything changes and it constantly changes. So but what won't change is that um and this is this is like I don't know how to say it, but I almost feel like it's more like at a spiritual level Now that I'm thinking about it What won't change is that very is this oppositional force to clarity and to truth, right? If you can think about it, there's always opposition to clarity and truth. So there's opposition to good and clarity and truth are part of that, which so I'm just, I'm Tina braining right now, which is really weird. I hear myself, I know I sound weird, but it's a thought that I just had, because I was thinking about, you know, things evolved, you would think that clear analytics would be part of the evolution, but my brain instantly was like, well, no, it won't be because there's opposition to truth and clarity, because that causes confusion and there's definitely, you know, this force that wants confusion and anyway, that was just weird. But yeah, so you will be always be needed, because by default, I think there will never be something that is very clear that helps people have clear data, clear understanding of their business, because that makes them powerful, right? You can't know what levers are the right levers if you don't understand what they are, what they do, the impact that they make, aka data, analytics. So regardless of how much WordPress itself changes, and the themes change, and the technology, and the underlying foundational basis of them changes, I don't think there's ever going to be anything that is by default does anything like what you do for the purpose of the things that you do, which is, you know, fast, reliable site, but also clear, valuable, usable data, and easily created websites that give all of that, that, that, that make it possible to have all of that. Anyway, so I was just wondering the whole path that how long it's taken, but I guess what was the original motivator and it sucks because like if we could just do osmosis and like relay thoughts instantly, that would be so different because it takes like 10 minutes to explain something that passes through my brain almost instantaneously and simultaneously, but that like it's wild that it's taken this long to be working on this and the fear is that technology could evolve and you have done all of this and then become obsolete, but all of that that I just said was my brain's argument that happened instantaneously that you're not going to be obsolete because of the data component because of the clear, because of the simplicity, because of the reliability and all of that. Nobody does that on a massive, level, aka like WordPress, right? Or most of the other big things, because that isn't their primary goal, like that's your ML right there. Fast, clear, easy, reliable. Anyway.
00:16:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's the, you know, if all these things are moving to like fractional this and fractional that, it's like you can outsource this whole thing to one place and be done.
00:16:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If Dan sells it. Yeah.
00:16:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's they mean.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll sell it first.
00:16:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'll sell it when it's ready, but come on. But seeing what he did with these other guys, I'm like, oh my god, that's so close, except I looked at their stuff and I'm like, ours is better. Because they're, they're building it as an agency. So they're building for their thing. And I'm like, well, we're building it for someone to run their business on and stuff like that. Well, you're Frank going and then hopefully it'll be in six to eight weeks and weirdly that's exactly what the medium said.
00:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so when did you go see a medium like the most recently?
00:17:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I didn't tell you that.
00:17:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, seen two.
00:17:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've seen two.
00:17:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The one was with my mom is the one that we've seen forever. hmm. The ball was the one that was like, there's someone on your team that you can't trust. And she's like, uh, and do not keep this person around. I don't want you to keep this person around and go, well, I know who you're talking about. I don't plan on keeping them around. And she's like, it's not a bad person, but you can't, you can't rely on them. And I was like, that's so weird that she would say that. But I knew exactly who it was. And then so I like, Oh, yeah, I know the plan is to, you know, not keep more. like I'm telling you don't. I go okay um so then we can dinkly. He's he's out. Yeah and then I met with a different I met with like a medium psychic channeler yesterday and uh that Molly turned me on to some Molly um and Molly's been you know Molly is like this uh woman that I worked with here.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's the first person I met years ago um was she the like which one lady?
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah she's the one that calls me which yeah okay so when you like I said that I was placing my hands together pressing my hands together because I was thinking about that story yeah yeah anyway okay I'm making her bring the right thing yeah so she recently resurfaced and seen her in a while and so she's come here a couple times the office and you the studio for stuff. And so she was telling me one day she was here. She's like, Oh, I gotta introduce you to Carissa. Like Carissa's that she's next level blah blah blah blah. And I was like, okay, she's like, you love it. I got you know me. I'll try it. So she reached out to Carissa and was like, Hey, this is my friend Dan and it'll be great if you could do a reading with him or whatever. And then her assistant wrote back like, Oh, Carissa's booked up for like 18 months. There's no there's no whatever like we can put him on the wait list or whatever. And yeah, yeah, got it. It was like, Oh, okay. And Molly's like, Oh, well, I mean, you're on the wait list or whatever. And I go, okay, whatever. And then maybe a couple weeks later, this person woman emails me and it's like, Hey, I've got I've neat with you. And I was like, Oh, okay. And then we kind of went back and forth and figured out a date. then I hit up Molly. I was like, Hey, Carissa reached out to me and set up a date. going to meet with her. I'm talking to each other. Oh, I can't wait to get her. Okay. So then in the interim, because this is months ago, like I was booked months in advance. And then in the interim, Molly went to one of her journeys, like they go to Sedona and go out in the desert or whatever, right? So when she was at the journey, she pulled Carissa to the side and was like, Hey, why, why did you like, I talked to Dan, you're doing a call with him. Like, I thought you were booked for 18 months. Like, why, how, what's going on? And she said, Oh, well, I reached out to him energetically. And she's like, I have to talk to this guy. He's like, his energy is crazy.
00:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Molly's like, Oh, wait.
00:20:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just wait till you talk to him. And I was like, oh, that's so funny. And then then the call got screwed up because she got sick and then I started thinking I'm not going to do this call I was like weirded out by it for some reason. I was like, I don't think I should talk to this person. Like, I don't know. There's so I'm like, I was like borderline scared. Okay, I do this. So I did for like three weeks and then I was walking home the other day and I was like, no, just do it. Like the fact that you don't want to do it means you should do it. So I emailed and I was like, and she had sent the dates. I'm like, let's do this date, which is yesterday. So then we, right when we get on the call, it was like, I just need to tell you a couple of days up front. She was like, so what she had said was when I agreed to the call the first time, she goes, okay, the reading starts now. So I'm going to be meditating on you and reaching out to you and you can do the same to me. Like if you want to open yourself up and allow. Allow yourself to reach out to me. You can or whatever. I was like, okay, like what the are you talking about? Okay, sure So she's like three starts now, but so don't know a couple weeks and then I said that to Molly. She's like, oh, yeah, Like you can you can and I know I don't I don't I'm out. How would I even do that? So a couple weeks into it Like I don't and Molly was like, yeah, you can reach out to her in your dreams And I was like sure I Do not remember my dreams like ever. It's very rare to remember them, but One night I have this dream like weeks after this stuff's been booked I'm not really thinking about it at all But I have this dream and a woman is in my dreams and it's a face and I don't know who it is Like I don't know who that is and then I woke up the next day and I was like that was weird Like, I don't recognize that. I was just weird. I just remember thinking, oh, that's weird. And then I you not. A couple of days later, I go, wait a second. What does this person look like? I don't even know what this woman looks like. So the woman in my dream was like, 40s, maybe 50s, like strawberry blonde hair, there is . I look out this woman. That's exactly what she has. And I was like, that's so weird. That is so weird. I'm like, I wonder if that's okay. And then a couple weeks later, a couple weeks before now, four or like three weeks ago, I had this dream where a guy was in my dreams and it looked like my uncle. But I was like, I'm not sure that's him. But I thought, oh no, that's Jack. That's my uncle, Jack, who's alive. And then... And I remember waking up the next day and I was like, Oh, like, am I having one of those things where the person is Dan, and they came together. So I go online, looking to see if they want to get news. Like, I text my mom, like, have you heard anything about Jack lately? He's like, Oh, he's fine. Well, okay, whatever. So I got in the call with her yesterday and up front, she's going, I got to tell you some stuff. And she's like, your energy is crazy. And she's like, I have every time I reached out to you through meditation, she's like, you shifted. You've shifted again, you shifted again, you shifted again. She's like, it's not normal. She's like, you're, she's like, you're on this journey. And you've been on it for like the last four years. She's like, I don't even want to talk about what you did before because you did stuff before. We're not going to talk about it. We're going talk about the last four years. But she's like, just these last nine months, you've, you've made this thing and you're shifting. When every time I tap into you, you shift. You should get like a master's class in like spiritual journey, because you're doing things at such a fast pace. It's like nothing I've ever seen. I was like, oh, okay. And she's like, to give you an idea, when I normally do one of these readings, I come into the reading with one or two pages of notes. She's like, I have nine pages of notes sitting in front of me right now. So she's like, I'm just going to go. It's going to go fast because I want to cover all of this. And she's like, so just be prepared. That was like, okay. And then she just opened this fire hose and started going. And the accuracy was off the charts, right? So I was like, okay. Now, what I didn't tell her was before we got in the call, I never said this. I never told anybody this that what I've been wondering for years. I know that I have two guides. know it. I know there's two people. I don't know who it is. I feel like they're family members, right? I just know that they're there. So we eventually get into the call. And I don't know where she goes. You have a very strong connection with your guide.
00:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's two of them.
00:26:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, I've always wondered who they are. So all of a sudden she goes, she switches into. She's like, I'm going to, and she said this might happen. She's like, at some point I might just switch into medium. And she goes, okay, I'm switching, right? There's a bunch of people here that want to talk to you, that are waiting to like interact. I go, okay. So the first thing she says is, I just hear piano music. Somebody is playing piano. It's beautiful. And this is a gift that they had. And they're like, but it's a gift that they got from their father. So it's my grandfather. I know that's he played piano, but what I didn't know was that his dad played piano. So I like, okay, she's talking about my grandfather, I think. I don't know that he played piano. So I like, no, to self, ask my mom. And then she goes, there's another guy here, and she's like, this is one of your guides. I you not, Tina. The second she said that, the name Joe popped into my head. And she goes, it's a J name. And then in unison, we both said, Joe. She goes, she goes, whoa. I want to come back to that. I go, okay, goes, okay. yeah, Joe, and she starts talking about him. And I'm like, this is either my uncle or my grandfather. And I thought it was my uncle, but she's saying stuff. And I'm like, sounds, I don't know. So she says all this stuff. she's like, Joe has been with you. I'll watch is over you Joe how Joe's life did not turn out the way he thought it was going to and she goes into all this detail I'm like that's grandfather and then she says some other stuff. I'm like that's uncle So I think she didn't realize that they had the same name and they were kind of crossing back and forth But then she's like Joe Watches over the girl with an a name He's very he's very watchful of her and I was like what the Like wow She's like who's that who is that? It was it was wild. It was wild some of stuff that she was saying But then she goes she goes okay. I want to stop How did you know it was Joe and I got I didn't it just the name popped into my head before you said it She's like seriously. go. Yeah, it's like dude. That's crazy. I'm like you're the medium What are you talking about?
00:28:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have to tell you something because I So my spirituality obviously is religious specifically.
00:29:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so's hers. That was the other weird thing.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to tell you this because this is this is where it's me. This is your dime, by the way, we're talking about all of this. Normally, I am very resistant to so the scriptures talk about beware of sous sayers, things like that, basically that really don't engage with mediums and whatnot. Okay, but here's, I'll tell you this, I approach the scriptures very differently because I feel like that there's there's a spectrum of people and obedience and understanding and spiritual strength and powers and whatnot. And I think that the majority of commandments are given for basically the average person, right? This is the guidelines that they need. And I believe that there is room for exploration and that people with higher level spirituality will be able to discern where the difference, I guess, between the letter of a law and the spirit of the law and discern between good and bad and be able to actually figure these things out for themselves rather than just to be like, okay, three-year-old boy, these are the boundaries, don't go outside of that because if you do, it'll be dangerous. But really, it is dangerous, but also, there's so much more to explore. You're just not equipped to be able to handle the danger, so I want you to stay inside here. Whereas other people are equipped to handle the danger and equipped to do the exploration and equipped to learn and to expand perpetually, which is where I fall. You fall. So, and I've had experiences with, like, Ouija board and it won't let me play with that by myself because it literally just moves my hand off the board because I don't want to talk to dark spirits and I believe that dark spirits can do whatever they want to they can lie and that good spirits can't but that good spirits also have to obey certain rules and act in a certain way and one of my biggest the only indicator I ever have that I trust what's the word like always always always always trust is peace because Jesus Christ is the prince of peace like that's the only whether people believe in him or not is irrelevant to me but that that he and God that that is the only emotion that Satan or any kind of darkness can't replicate they can replicate everything else pleasure excitement tell the truth mixed with lies you know a little bit here little bit there because They don't do good, but they can look like they're doing good. When you were talking, my original, you know, my normal, I would say kind of walls, but it's more like a discerning net, I guess, is my discerning antenna, not net, because I like to be open and receive things so that I can learn always and try to catch myself in judgment so that I'm not judging things that incorrectly. What was interesting to me, especially when you got to Joe, first of all, it was the absence of negative feelings and anxiety, which I often feel around many medium conversations, because I think there's a lot that just aren't great, but that wasn't there. So I noticed that that wasn't there, but what surprised me was this feeling. And that I'm very, very much recognized and identify with being God related, a piece of warmth, from head to toe, and wanting to cry, which is also that like manifestation that that comes with it. And that really surprised me, it made me think I want to talk to her. I'm always like avoiding, I'm like, I will, I'm not going to do things God does not want me to do. I just applied, did I tell you that I would be a missionary? No, I'm going to do a genealogy missionary mission.
00:33:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm super excited about it.
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she's like, you're not actually the youngest one. She goes, we have people in their 20s. She goes, but they're autistic. I was like, Oh, other than the autistic on there, the youngest ones are being it's called the senior mission. But we'll have devotionals on Wednesdays. And I've committed 12 hours a week to just genealogy work for the church. And that's we do that for so that we can do tempo work for the dead so that people that didn't have an opportunity to be baptized, to see baptism and things like that. Anyway, so that was just this whole thing. It was just wild to me. And of course she felt your energy, like, I was just thinking she's like, you're not normal.
00:34:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's Dan everywhere in his life.
00:34:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you know, it really crazy.
00:34:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Some of the that she said, I was like, there's no way, there's no way you could never know this. So she was like, hey, I just want to let you know that like, she's like, you have a great heart. But she's like, you're a kiddie. You have two Achilles heels. Oh, I go, okay. And she's like, your first, your first one is, you help too much. And I was like, get the out.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How could you?
00:34:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Tina has told you that too. No, I know, but I was like, how could a stranger? Right. know that. And she's like, let me, let me explain what I mean by it. And then she goes into the explanation. I was like, yeah, I'm like, she nailed it. And I was like, yeah, I've recently come to realize that that my help is not helping. And she just laughed. She goes, Oh my God, that is so perfect. Yes, your health doesn't help because she's like, they're advocating responsibilities and putting them on you. And it's not your responsibility. And she's like, you need that you need to stop doing that.
00:35:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, you have no idea.
00:35:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She goes, at one point, she goes, she's like, the biggest word on this page of notes, she's like, I'm nine pages, but the biggest word and all this is the word space. So she's like, you've been creating space, you need to keep creating it. I go, there's one, there's one left. Like, there's one left. And she goes, what do you mean? I go, there's one of those advocating, whatever relationship. And I told her a little bit about how I figured all this stuff out.
00:36:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She knows. Oh, yeah, you need they need to go Are you talking about Eric?
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, um woofer They need to go and I was I forget what the other one was. She sent the call. I gotta listen to it again It was like two hours or some , but Now here's so much more now, man Here's the trippy here's the trippy part that she obviously couldn't have known or doesn't know And I went to the other medium right Paula who I've known for like 20 years At the end of the thing Paula goes is there anything else you want to ask me I go. Yeah I'm supposed to meet with this medium who's like a Channeler bop up by explaining to her and she goes, okay, let me let me, you know, let's look at that All right, great. So Paula like does her thing and she goes, okay She's going to tell you that she can't help you go any further. And I was like, okay, she's like, that's it. She can't help you go any further. I was like, okay, but I Molly that, Molly instantly goes, oh no, that is not how Carissa works. That's not what that will not happen. It was a thousand percent happened. She was like, at the end of the call, she goes, I have nothing for you. Wow. She's like, that never happens to you. I'm going to give you a couple of things, but she's like, you're organically doing these things. Yep. And you're fine. And she's like, and by next year, she's like, next year, you're going to have the biggest shifts in your life. And it's all the work you've been doing is leading up to 2025. She's like, 2025 is going to be a huge year for you on all. from, but she's like, I don't, you could, I could offer you to come to one of my sessions, and you're welcome to, but she's like, honest with God, you don't need it. You don't need anything. And I was like, oh my God, it really wouldn't been other person said.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, this is trippy. Yeah, but it doesn't surprise me though, because if there is anybody that is, and I say if, because I feel like I have strong intuitive powers, which is why really early on all say things to people that I really don't have a foundation for saying. I don't really have enough knowledge to say it, but I know it. And a lot of that is psychological profiling, but that's definitely not all of it. There's a good portion of intuition. But also I've been watching you and you, you, I think the, like you have a level of knowing about yourself, but you, you fight it anyway.
00:39:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. told her that.
00:39:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
totally admitted that.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I feel like that actually is the biggest shift that you've made, but the momentum of that it has rapidly increased in the last year and a half or so. And I'm not sure if there was a thing that happened or a trigger or you just arrived at a tipping point. Maybe I had something to do with the age of the girls too. was like, because being a parent changes you and raising people changes you. As you watch them, you start to re-evaluate your childhood because you can now see it from a parent side and go, okay, I have these experience and those feelings and now you just kind of see them differently or it re-validates things. But either way, you have a new level of knowing, just raising children, and that will change you. Anyway, regardless, your level of knowing and confidence and first of all, installing, but then enforcing boundaries and shrinking them a little bit. So like when I met you, there was all kinds of people in dance and or something that didn't belong there. And you, so that shrinking right first started happening, that just pushing people out. But at the same time, I think the, like imagine the boundary of being a physical wall, the density of that boundary also increased. And it's like, I don't know, however you want to visualize it. That's what's fortifying. like you're the certainty of you belong, you don't belong and here's why and it doesn't matter if you agree with that or don't agree with that and also your understanding of the cost for so like solving people's puzzles you're like oh well I learned this and I learned this and I accept the cost of that but I think that your value of what price you're willing to pay for learning has also shifted a little bit and then anyway all of those things are just kind of converging I guess would be the word and her hurt so I the funny thing is I didn't look into her that much right I was but then on the phone I was like oh she's like definitely like very Catholic I would say so at one point she was like you oh my god this keeps happening to Tina I don't know what else go
00:42:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of this, but she's like, you are surrounded by symbols of Christ. She's like, you're surrounded by them. And she's like, you're like, there are, she's like, I'm seeing nuns and priests and churches. She's like, you're, you're surrounded by it. She's like, you're very, like, you're very connected to the Archangel Michael. She's like, you're very connected to that. But her explanation of like the journey that people go on. She's like, he compared it to Christ's journey in that like, but it's people's individual journey. She's like, there's a death of self. And then you, then you go into the tomb, and she's like, the tomb is almost like, she's like, if you think about it like this, Jesus was reborn almost as if he came out of a womb. It was the tomb, the rock rolled away, he emerged. she's like, and then he's reborn as his spirit self. She's like, that's the journey You can take not like him, but that those three steps and she's like right now you're in the womb So it's so funny that you're like you're fortified you're surrounded. I'm like, oh, that's weird Or like what she said So did I did I build a tune?
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and my faith believes that he was resurrected resurrected like with a physical body and that we were all spirits before we came here and that we receive our bodies and that we will be resurrected and we see them back again, but they will be changed and unable to die unable to be corrupted and What we know about science that makes perfect sense to me that there's the ability to figure that out, you know Anyway, it's all fascinating to me, but yeah, yeah, so We spent so much time on that. really want to know that I mean, I don't regret that. I just want to make sure that we also do But it's anyway, it's part of journey we do that we do Mercer's course. Yeah, yes, yes. But this is the thing, though, is that I've really been able to I've been leaning more into the whole list approach because the business is nothing without the solidity of the CEO behind it, the visionary behind it, the the person and all of those values. Like I think about Mark, I think about everyone's evolution that I've ever worked with. And the biggest transformation happened with the person, then then their business, the business had a correlating transformation. But 100% every time the person had the bigger transformation. Like when you think about who you work with, how much time has been working with them, the way that you handle them, but also like your sleep, your hormone health, your physical health, I did I'm not the one that did all of that, but you've been on this journey, we discuss it, and then you go and do different things. But just being an assistant or facilitator or whatever it is to that process, and knowing that the systems, the teams, all those processes are critical, they're the simplest part of it. They're really easy to do. The first thing is kind of editing, modifying the person that's running it so that their prime is to be able to understand the power, the need for not only creating the infrastructure, you know, in the particular way, in the logical way, which to me also is part of my mission. What I don't to out of people's lives. I feel like that's kind of preparing them for when they're ready to talk to God, when they're ready to have him in their life, because they now recognize people that lie. They now recognize chaos. They now recognize darkness a little bit differently. And that's not the conversations we have, but it happens. They become happier people, but they put more order in their lives. They put more goodness in their lives. They put more integrity in their lives and in their business. Anyway, it's just been wild. The things that you happen, you're like, it's wild, but of course, I've been having so much of that, the people that marks into me. I was just like, I want different clients. And I was like, do you have anybody? And then he sent me somebody and that guy was awesome. And then there's, he's talking about another person that as I'm working with the new doctor and just, Working on the mission talking to you all the things that you're going through. I'm just like it's just it just keeps getting better Faster, but also like right Darker on the other side. You know what I mean? Like the polarity. It's wild. Anyway, okay. Yes. Marshall Mercer Mercer Where are we happening? Huh?
00:47:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's happening. just got it's long Yeah, like there there's like it's not a course. It's like five. Oh Go through. Yeah. Yeah, finished one.
00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, that the like the cave the whatever Is that what you were calling five or like what?
00:47:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no Framework So it's like framework then GA for itself then Measurement and reporting plan So like his whole thing is really you learn the framework and then you do the plan and the plan, I'm forgetting a step, a plan something and then the launch or plan to launch something, there's three steps. So but in each of those steps, you have to, the first step of planning in the cave is GA4. So you got to go learn GA4, right? So you go through the whole framework and it's like, okay, this is the overarching 30,000 for view. Now go set up, go learn GA4 real quick and then set up the basic GA4 and then you're going to go set up your reporting and forecasting and then you're going to set up whatever you're going to do the cave version of all those. So you're going to do those steps three times, then you're going to go back and you're going to redo the plan from the valley. So you're going plan again, that might be where you're out in GTN. I'm going to to go through all of them because I'm not in the cave in some respects. I'm in the Summit in other respect, right? So I'm all over the place So I have to go through all of them, and I'm sure there's little nuances like There's probably stuff in that a I don't need GA for it all right? So there's probably stuff in GA for I mean, I really don't know it, right? It's like I don't know But there's probably little said you say you don't need it or you don't know it know it know it Oh, cuz I thought you said you don't need it at all So it sounds like you're you'll do like the foundation the framework of everything then GA for then like this measurement and forecasting thing and Then something else and then you go back and they'd be like oh you want now you want to do custom Okay, Now you're gonna do GTM So there's at least four or five So I'm on two. I'm on the second one.
00:50:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that's a lot.
00:50:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a lot. But and here's the thing. like, who's going to do this? No one. But once you do it, and then it's available to everyone.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that though. Okay, so at this point, so last week, you told Lynn probably like another week or so or something. What are you thinking now?
00:50:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, I didn't say a week.
00:50:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my God.
00:50:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I can probably get it done in that period of time.
00:50:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just feel like it's a momentum kind of thing that it's and keeping everything fresh because of the technical nuance of it that. But then again, there's that whole kind of subconscious distilling that happens when you're like, your brain is working it out. when you're not like, oh, I could do this. Or, oh, I need do this. Or it just kind of makes more sense kind of thing. Oh, anyway. And I also know that it's not a, I kind of refer to myself sometimes as having full energy, which is just like, I'm going to plow through. And also knowing that that really never works out well for me. That doesn't work best. But anyway, OK, how is another 71 doing? Like, what have you observed anything? Any changes? Any ahaas this week?
00:51:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, other than like the sales during 4th of July were higher than expected, higher than the last 2th of July. So it was like, oh, we can really get a dip, which is weird. But we got a bunch But it's on point with the other surge that was already.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
already happening, right?
00:52:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, so that would have ended on the 25th. So, and we did get a huge spike in cancels around that date. Like I'm so visually obvious.
00:52:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, Oh, that looks weird.
00:52:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it was to be expected. So then that had us lose some subscribers. That that was week prior. Then this week we gained subscribers, but then the daily average was still 32. So I was like, okay. But if that makes sense, then we're in the high season. But what didn't make sense is that it was better than the last two for the July's. But not like crazy, Tom.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, and did you have any new thoughts or feelings around the ceiling?
00:52:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, we're gonna hit it. It's unavoidable. Yeah, we're getting close. I think we're at 4060. So I had estimated that hitting at 155 days, around June 20th, I figured that out. So by August, I think, August, September, we should hit it. And that'll be also when sales start to dip again. So then we'll probably... So there's a chance you could go over it. That's the problem. It's like, yeah, we could go over it in this quarter. But when you zoom out at the end of the year, it's going to end up being that you hit it. Once you hit it, you're going to be in and around that number from that day forward. So if we hit it, we could hit it and exceed it in September or August. But when things slow down and we go back down to a 22-day average, we're averaging 32 now. you're going to go over, but your sales are going to naturally cycle down and keep 2, 3, Q4 to the 22. And if you're already out, that's if you're over the ceiling, it's going to come down to 490, but it won't go way below it. So that explains how in the past, we saw like, oh, we had like 4,500 subscribers, but that was like a peak that lasted three weeks, right?
00:54:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we just weren't looking at in the context of, oh, when you zoom out, it's all the same, same, same, same, same, So I have notes for, and this was a couple of weeks ago that we talked about it, the conversion rates and the purchase path for the 2-path page. Oh, my dog.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hold on.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Thank you. for the 2-path page to determine which path has higher conversions and where to optimize. so yeah so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna do any of that stuff until I go through mercy yeah yeah because that's part of his thing is like why would you even do that like why would you do why would you do that in the context of not really knowing what's happening right which is what I've done forever right what the heck is that oh my gosh I just copy paste and it did percentage MCE paste bin percentage I feel like I'm gonna end up being tech support in my mission I I have I mean I spent six years in the tech support community and a call center and didn't do it the whole time I'm mostly managed but Yeah, it's okay. But also because it's like search stuff and mission, like I feel different about it. It's not like I have to do it, you know what I mean?
00:56:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes it different. And they have to have some level of skill to even be able to do it, so there's stuff. Let's see, it's turning extent of customer confusion about ninja being the supplement versus the full course. Reach out to Delphi AI. Oh, that's the Joe thing.
00:56:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, we did that. Yeah. We built a ninja bot. It works really well. It works really well. The Bobby's been working on that a bunch. We're actually just subscribed. We're like, screw it.
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a little bit more about that, like what it does and how it's doing.
00:56:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're basically building an agent.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
right?
00:57:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like you can't inject it to before, but they must add some layer on it that helps it. I mean, they're not. It's not like they have their own LL and they're tapping into checking the TV line.
00:57:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Oh, so I did ask this, but I like, or maybe I thought about asking it that we were deep in the whole medium conversation, but just Eric. Oh, I was asking, so you said, hey, I'm B.J. and Avishik or on the same page with stuff, but like, well, something I noticed on the call this week, which is not, I was trying to figure out like how you're reading Eric and his attitude. And I was like, trying to pay attention to him, and I remember him feeling this way before when I was first working with him. him and he got annoyed with me and mad at me. And it was it's because he's very subtle about it.
00:58:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's full of passive aggressive.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but if video is so acid. Well, hold on. I want to explain what I what I felt when I was listening to the call, which is this and but he's so mild in all of it, but it's almost like this annoyance and like I don't know anything like he's like I don't know. And like it's really when I was listening, I was listening carefully. I'm like, if you didn't know Eric, you'd never know that there's an issue. It's not overt in any kind of very sunny, very sunny.
00:58:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Yeah. It's very there's a the facade is like sunny, happy, helpful, but it but then you listen to the words and sometimes the delivery like Yeah, he's he's
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because was just very like, yeah, yeah, and it's really, I would have no way to be able to compel anybody to believe or understand that there's an issue if I, you know, wanted to. Yeah, which is just so interesting because that type of personality can really make you question what you think you're feeling, or you know what I mean, because it's so passive. Right. But I would imagine that that creates its own level of conflict, because like, do you just say what you actually think and how you actually feel?
00:59:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I mean, I think I have to do like, I can pick it up via a slack message. Like, I know what it looks, see it. Yeah.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here we go.
00:59:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, but it seems to have lessened for sure. Well, that's good. Do you think it's because Moneer's gone or less interaction with Givar?
01:00:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, do you have any? any idea why? Oh, you might have hit on it right there. Yeah, he's gone. He's got some health issues, so that are sidelined him for weeks. So the vipers out of the building, right? Well, it's like the yeah, the toxic sort of you just made me think like something you said made me think like what like he sits around stews on things and I'm like really that's your problem. Like don't sit around and stew on it. Like redirect that energy into something else. Like go put on a fricking book or some . How's he? But I think when it's compounded when it's you have this soundboard for lack of a better term. Oh, yeah. Exactly.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not a soundboard.
01:00:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's an echo chamber.
01:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a it's from this negative energy.
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, whatever, ultimately though, you, you, here's the thing, here's the trap with people like that is because they're so passive and so subtle. And because it waxes and wanes, we increase our level of tolerance for it, but it doesn't decrease the cost to us. So, and you've been working with them long enough to know that at the end of the day, the evolution, I mean, it's not consistent. His cycle is consistent. Growth is not like, because I have a mom like this. She appears to grow and have cycles of growth. But, and I wish that I could show this to you, but imagine me drawing spiral circles, but my hand keeps raising up. So, I'm drawing them, like do it with your own hand, make a circle, but then raise your hand a little bit, make another circle, and raise your hand a little bit, make another circle. So, even though you're coming back down, your low is higher each time. To me that's growth, like you go up, you go down, you go up, you go down, but every time you go down, you don't go as low as you did the last time, that's perpetual growth. So, up and down, and down, the lows are different.
01:02:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Eric. what? Like Bitcoin.
01:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, totally. gotcha. Eric, on the other hand, they're like my mom, like the lows, they go right back to center.
01:02:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. Totally.
01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
same. And those are the people I've learned, like I, I don't cut them off, like I'm never going to cut my mom off. Um, but I, and I'm never going to stop. trying, but the level of effort that I put into it and the level of hope I have and the level of energy I allow her to use of mine is fixing determined and will not increase unless she changes that habit that knowing that you know she's 67 years old she's not like really change that habit. You've been working with Eric as long as we've been working together basically so at least seven years and he he comes back down to the same place that we were at seven years ago, six years ago. However long it was when we first started talking to him together and I was able to observe him and that is massively telling like your night and day difference. I've evolved so much more since then. Right. has evolved so much since then. Stacy has evolved and I wouldn't even tell you the only problem I would have was Stacy as her
01:04:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
confidence in being able to go out there.
01:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, but she's grown. And she's diedily grown and improved. So, but Eric has come all the way back to that same place.
01:04:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that and always does.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, but you're letting that in in your your realm. And here's the thing that I told you many, many, many, many, many times. And I don't think that you believe me. Is that that takes a bigger toll on you than I think that you're aware of. Because you tell yourself it doesn't bother.
01:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But well, it doesn't. And it's not even relevant because we'll go back to the medium really quick. Okay. said she can't, this was out. Sorry. This was hilarious. So at one point, she goes off in this tangent, she's like, you really need to focus on like, or, you know, you got to get this foundation. right, right? If the foundation is right, then you can, you know, you don't want to build on sand. So once you get this foundation right and it's, and it's rock solid, then you're going to be able to build on this. So I'm like, uh-huh, that's real basis, right? And then she goes, and when you're working on this stuff, this blew my mind. So I like, oh my god, did I do this on purpose? I never thought about this before. She's like, you're going to get these things and they're just going to start to flow, right? The thing is just going to flow. Everything's going to say, she kept saying the word flow, flow, flow. Like, I know I'm like, oh my god, all of them are flow. All of them have the name flow. And I was like, I never thought about that. And then she goes, hey, come the fall. He said something about like between this time period, she's like, hey, want you to go on a trip, just go somewhere, not like international. She's like, just take time, go somewhere. And she's like, but at that, that's the period in time where she's like, You need to have some conversations and you need to have, you need to lay down and make clear exactly what is going to happen. All the eyes dotted, all the teas crossed, get these agreements in place. She's like, I don't know if they're agreements or contracts or what they are, but she's like, you've already been renegotiating with people and you're going to have to do that one more time in the fall. And she's like, I just want you to be super, super clear and get exactly, get it all out and get it exactly down. So she's like, transparency is like your biggest friend, you're a very transparent person. She's like, you just got to get that down. I'm like, oh my God, she's talking about all the conversations I'm planning on having. I'm like, And I was like, that's so weird. But so tied into what you were just saying is like, I still need to do that. And I'm going to do it. And it's like, and she's like, if you do that, then you're set, you're all set. I mean, I'm 100% positive. There's zero doubt in my mind. Like, there's not even a shade of doubt that we will sell Ninja in two or three years, period, it's going to happen. And I'm working, that is my plan, and it's not going to change. And it's whether or not this stuff works. Like, yes, I want it to work. But if it doesn't, oh, well, I've done what I wanted to do. but I'm going to make it clear. Like, Hey, know, it's time it's, I sent this to Denise yesterday, or this morning. I was like, their choice is going to be you either go get a job at 53, good luck. That's going to be a joy. Or you figure out how to make this thing, you don't. would treat this like a job anymore. Right. Right. And it's it's it's either or like it's up to you. So and that applies to all of them.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:08:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we'll see.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You will see.
01:08:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My job is to get the damn code done. That's it. That's my job. And Frank, I'm to do it.
01:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am excited to see what but you know the cautiously optimistic but I'm always down for the journey though because it doesn't matter every time I look back. I'm like, wow, you know, like imagine being on on a mountain and then looking back at all the mountains you've already climbed. Like to me, it's always like that. never look back and go where I've barely moved or I've gone backwards. It doesn't matter what didn't go right, what's not what I planned on. I can always look back and go, wow, every single day. And I think that's pretty cool. I think you do that too. Whether you do the looking back and think that or not, I think that you are always moving forward and evolving. like, if you were to stop back, I really have to say, stop saying and I'm like, but anyway, if you think.
01:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I've got some of those.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but if you stop and did look back intentionally and just evaluate where you've come from every time, if I were you, I'd be like, Wow, yeah, that's pretty cool.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I think what's interesting is like, I don't really have a destination, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think there is a destination. That's the why. That's the why stuff everybody thinks is even, even like Christians and getting to heaven, I'm like, do you really think? there's there anything that suggests, evidentially, evidentially, whatever. Evidently, right, that there is like, where you just, You get to heaven and you just relax and sing songs to Jesus all day long. like, does his life indicate that sitting around being saying to you is something he would like? Like the universe is continually expanding exponentially every single day. There is constant growth every single day and evolution, like you think at some point that's just gonna stop and we're all gonna rest and relax and like that's forever. Like that makes no sense.
01:10:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So to me there is no end point.
01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There might be destinations on a journey and plots on a course, but there is no end destination. There's a final destination. There is just continual evolution and growth.
01:10:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so weird that you say that. So I, someone gave me this book like two years ago and the book is, hey, you're supposed to open up the book every day and then there's like, I don't know if it's a quote or it's just a phrase. There's a phrase on my... one page and then there's like two other not necessarily connected but they go together right they don't necessarily go together they go together and that they're on opposite pages but the one that I opened up to this week and then they're like and then just read it every day and think about it the one I opened up this week is that the goals are just stops on your journey and I was like that's interesting I never thought about it like that like or or your yeah it was something like that I'll send it you I was like that's an interesting I never thought about it like that but that it seemed very applicable to me because I'm like I know they're not the destination the goal is not the destination to me it's like yeah so like I've always said I don't have goals I just go I want to go to I want to have these destinations but it's in a greater journey I guess like I don't know yeah well or some goals or whatever whatever you call them plots on course but yeah I mean That's it. It's like the dot.
01:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, I'm going to go there.
01:12:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's like, some people would call that a goal and I'm like, well, I don't really call it a goal. It's like, I just want to get there. But that's not where I stop.
01:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the other thing, though, is that I think a lot of us get really attached to language, where a lot of times we're saying the same things, but we're using different words. And the meaning behind those words is what's more important. And you have cultures where the words were drawn. You have, you know, people that communicate energetically, those words aren't even spoken. So, but you can feel it. And there's alignment. And when you do use the words, you're like, yeah, now I've heard the words, you know, that that's true, but I already felt it. Like, I already felt that I didn't have words for it anyway. So, yeah. Just fascinating. No, no ends, destination and continual growth, which also just about guarantee is not what's on. Eric's radar, because if it was, he'd be doing it, which is anyway, neither here.
01:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't think it's a lot of people's radar, fortunately.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but that's okay.
01:13:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We can be weird together, Dan.
01:13:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, totally. All right, I will let you go. All right. lovely day. Oh, and that trip, you know, Denise was wanting some exotic, wonderful trip that she thought was once in a lifetime and never going to happen again. So. Maybe there's way to combine those things.
01:13:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, she wants to go to the make up for our 25th wedding anniversary next year, so I am going to set that up. Let's go back to the same island that we went to for our original honeymoon.
01:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That gave me goosebumps.
01:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can do that. So this is going to probably be Motelish. Yeah, we'll see.
01:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll see. I can be excited for Denise, though, for that happening.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's awesome.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're a good guy, Dan.
01:14:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right, good, sir.
01:14:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a good day.

Hello. Hi. I can't hear you. muted. Okay.
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so bad about that.
00:00:09 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Hi.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:13 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I'm just heating up my my chat. were I started early because I started early today so so that I can make sure I'll be here. And do my I went to work early. And then I'm just I have six more patients to call. I'm trying to call it before I meet our meeting but it's not going to happen.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're in hustle mode, baby.
00:00:45 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Well, it also gives my family a year so I wanted to make sure that you know I can so obviously that means I can really do it if I really want to.
00:00:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was about to point that out but look, you just got there all by yourself.
00:01:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I know I've been really, yesterday it was a little busy because the NP is shadowing me and I'm like trainee her and it just definitely slows me down but I still finish my note that like I don't have, I may have one note that I didn't sign it's completed but I just didn't sign because I'm waiting for the staff to put the pharmacy information but it's like it's not my fault it's just it's complete so I feel good like I don't I know it's it should have been this like this the default anyway from the beginning but that's a point I thought to have yeah it's a point I mean to the extent that if you find yourself in a situation again and you want to ask yourself is this something I could be doing better could I be showing up better but you have to remember that the biggest issue was the
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and the calculations you were making in your head, and a tug of war between decisions. So first of all, it was the stress and anxiety of the unknown. So stress and anxiety always cloud our judgment, right? Then when you add on top of it, when you're learning so many new things, exhaustion kicks in. And we know that exhaustion inhibits judgment, right? So you've got both of those things kicking in. And then the calculations are, this math doesn't add up. I made way more money over here, and it was less stressful. So then what you have to do is realize that the goals are different, that the opportunity and the potential is different. That's a process that had to be worked through. Almost nobody would immediately be able to
00:03:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
figure all of that out.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because it takes experience and it was a new experience. So that was the whole point of all of it. We talked about how once you get bought in, the buy-in makes all the difference. You weren't bought in in the beginning. It was a good question mark. That is really what it was about. So the first thing that and when we realized and when you actually were able to realize that the issue is I haven't made the decision because I don't know if I want to make the decision. But when you gave yourself permission to just say that, it's like you were doing it for you for the first time for real. Like the originally it was supposed to be your choice, right? But when you got into somebody else's office and somebody else's space, it started to feel like not so much yours.
00:03:58 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Right.
00:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that Confused things and so you had to work through that but then when you decided and you're like wait I don't have to work there that much like I really can drive this flip to complete switch last week Now the one thing I will say is that I don't take anything as being the new normal until it's been several weeks And we've repeated that habit, you know, and we stay on it for months roughly about six months People say 21 days on like six months if you can hold a pattern for six months. I'm thinking we might be onto something Right. So let's see how it keeps going but I think that the biggest issue chona was just the evaluation process the learning the fatigue the exhaustion and then the Why are you really doing this?
00:04:50 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Remember we had that question Right, you're like because I have to I'm like, yeah, but you don't really have to Right like I I got um know that he's busy but wait what did he say he would do that he didn't want for example like he said that even if you know we're waiting for the insurance to kick in for my pay you know for each patient because that's that's why I get a higher pay because right I'm gonna wait till the insurance get paid or he gets paid you know before I get paid he told mark that he's still gonna pay please minimum 15 provided and then it didn't happen and then you know there are times where there is a patient in the clinic in the hospital where I made the decision it's a it's I'm gonna try to not be technical but it patient has a morphine implanted pump and it's empty and I told him you need to feel this because I'm not like privileged in the hospital to do it so you need to do it he said he will that was Thursday he didn't do it till Sunday and the hype the doctor doing the treatment is so pissed at us. And I have to talk to I don't know if you have four days to wait for that. I told you remember that doctor that was so mad that I pacify it. I talked to him for now. That was a difficult doctor who was so mad at us. But I talked to him for over an hour in person just to pacify him. And cannot control what he does. The thing with Dr. E is I think he's a good person. He just overextend himself. He's like super busy. Like he's in the OR doing OR case because he's an anesthesiologist. he's doing you know, he's like all over the place, you know. So the integration I'm getting a little I'm trying my best not to, you know, because we don't have a contract. I mean, we have a rip. I don't think he's gonna do that to us. But who knows, right? We don't mark an eye because, you know, Mark, we've known each other for a while and then Mark and him talk. I don't think he's gonna. You know, do something. I'm trying not to think of the negative or think in fear, but think of Let's look at the facts But anyways, um, I'm doing I feel good when I see a Intention like a PI patient whether it's his or mine I saw the patient now. thought the patient today. turn in I emailed the note today Like that's and I feel good like we send this to the attorney. recommend this procedure So I felt good at that.
00:08:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's what he he wants me on board to kind of help with his part of the lean two but and yeah, that that's really it but so something to consider and this is These conversations work best with Strategy and diplomacy and it'll probably be best coming from you rather than mark but When you feel strong, but not angry and strong, but not overpowering, but peaceful, strong, but peaceful, have a conversation with, like, I just want to make sure that we are on the same page. So first of all, the arrangement that we have is unique. I'm coming here not just as, you know, to be a nurse practitioner, but to run a business, and to be a business partner. And we don't have a contract because we have mutual respect and trust in one another.
00:09:41 - Chona Sweet, DNP
We need a contract, sorry, but we didn't sign it yet.

So, yeah, regardless, regardless, have, at the very least, a verbal contract and a draft written one with the expectation that I would be paid X. Now, as far as I know, I've met all my requirements. I fulfilled these tasks. Nothing that we specified has not been done. So I'm talking, I'm referring to, you know, there's probably an expectation that your notes were done on time. But if that wasn't specified as a contractual issue, then it's moot. That's the truth. Especially if you weren't said, if you weren't pulled aside and said, hey, look, I promise you 15,000. But if you don't do this basic, then I'm not going to do that. So contractually signed or not, you have not been paid, you know, 25% less than what, hold on, that's not 25. It's like 33% less than what you expected. And I would, it would be your best interest, Jonah, to practice having these types of conversations. So again, when you feel very strong, but peaceful. And for me, I don't feel For my faith, I'll just use my examples so people can believe whatever they believe and hopefully you're okay with it. For me, Jesus is the Prince of Peace. So like everything that's peaceful comes from Him, comes from God. Nobody else can give that. So if I feel peace, I know I'm aligned with God. And I know that I'm not being contentious and I'm standing in goodness. It doesn't mean I'm perfect or anything like that. It just means this thing right now, I'm doing my best to be in integrity. And honest and true. So if I can feel powerful but peaceful, I know I'm in a really good place and I will choose my words carefully and I will read the room. And if somebody gets angry, I'll work to diffuse it and just say, hang on, I'm just trying to make sure that we're on the same page. And then the other tactic that I use is I ask questions. I'll ask a question like, did I understand incorrectly? Did you not say that you were going to pay me $15,000 even before insurance?
00:12:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
and kicked in and that's where you have him because he's either going to lie I don't remember or no or he's going to have to admit that he said it and didn't do it and I love questions right i think i think this is mine being very how do i say it's passing i don't want um on confrontation yeah i don't want confrontation i think he may have told me is it okay if i tell me that so it's two months in it i thought he's just going to do it on the first month so it's two months in a row so Mark's opinion is well you know technically this last month is where you really see the patience on your everything on your own it's interesting maybe so mine but this last month is where it's like a very consistent hospital so he said let's see how this goes for next month that's like he said that when when did you say that mark just two days ago and i told him that i get paid so that when the doctor e asked you if it was okay if he could pay you ten who uh last month i mean uh last month when he paid first pay me and did you say did you ask him at the time like do you mean instead of 15 000 period or just i did not that's the thing i was not very clear and so mark things that the third one the third the next one next month should be more consistent right you know again mark reminded me that this is the thing you know we requested for you to have a higher pay we negotiated for you to have a higher pay for the insurance to kick in and so usually insurance doesn't kick in till 3060 days after so you know so one one way that you so going back to you there is a business partner um so and i would say i was a little caught off
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guard with the, can I just pay you 10,000? And it's not in my nature to be confrontational. So, you know, and I didn't feel like, you know, I was really fully embedded into the company, and so that felt okay. But I want to know what the expectation is moving forward. And I just also want to let you know, full transparency, that I made a lot more money going over here. So this doesn't make sense for me unless I'm more profitable. And maybe it doesn't make sense for you either. So go ahead and give them room for an outfit. But when you say that, then you say, but I think that this really is most lucrative for both of us once we get going. But in the meantime, you know, I've done this, I've done this, I've done this, go ahead and list off all the things, all the things that you've felt you've given him a relief in. And so I, rather than have an offer. the cuff, you know, renegotiation, that's two to two and a $5,000.
00:15:04 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And I think we should just have a conversation one more time about what the expectations are until insurance kicks in or something like that. Okay, got it. But overall, I am feeling like the routine is there. You know, I have more routine. Like, I feel like I like what the schedule is. I actually realized that the Monday, Tuesday afternoon clinic is not a lot. I think it's just me not catching up on my notes. That's what it is. That's what I feel. A burden of being behind is tremendous, like it's a compounded way. it's the weekend. Because I feel like I have to do it on the weekend. But now I feel like this weekend we watch football.
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark's here.
00:15:48 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I want to let him in. Okay. Yeah, I watch football and I, you know, like, hi, Henry. Oh, there is. Hi, Han. Okay. Yeah, we watched football and I feel so relaxed to the point that I just want to don't bother me. I just want to read Martina's stuff. That's what I did on the weekend.
00:16:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You okay?
00:16:16 - Chona Sweet, DNP
already know you destroyed your immune system with antibiotics. Yeah, I didn't even it's three days more than that's it. Mark always flew in the past.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in about 10 years from now, you're gonna have lots of regrets.
00:16:36 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Trust me, but it's, it's, you know, it's, I, I know myself and I still work. Like, when I know I cannot get out of bed, that was bad.
00:16:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah.
00:16:47 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And I know how that feels. Like, I remember getting, they tell her did I go on? Louisiana. Hey, this year, my friend had a, they have a ranch, and Mardi Gras celebration. So I went there and then went back next day, because it's oh my gosh, it was bad.
00:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That probably hits you super fast, right?
00:17:19 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Like, like from the time you first noticed the sentence, you were out. Oh, yeah, my throat is on fire. Like, I've never, I said, what is this? Maybe I have a strepto, and the next day, I would, I unpack my clothes, and I cannot get out of bed. So Mark changed my flight, picked me up, because the ranch is like an hour and a half away from the airport.
00:17:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When was this?
00:17:46 - Chona Sweet, DNP
February, this year.
00:17:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh.
00:17:48 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And then I got home here, and then Mark was like, go to the urgent guy. Went to the urgent here, they did the swab. And then the doctor come in all on full.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, oh my god, is it that bad?
00:18:04 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Like, it's like, you probably feel work, Sarah, and you probably feel work, what did he say? And it's probably still really bad, huh? said, yes, I do, what do I have? Well, I don't see this often. I actually don't treat this often. He said, you have two, like the flu and COVID.
00:18:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lucky tone.
00:18:24 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I know.
00:18:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
to hijack.
00:18:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's up? We're just talking about, talking to Dr. E about this discrepancy in the original contract money and where she's performing right now and how to approach that until insurance kicks in.
00:18:41 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I told Tina about what you said, honey, maybe next month.
00:18:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
mean, that would be my assumption because he doesn't get paid by health insurance for usually 30 to 60 days. And part of the whole conversation was, I trying to pay when he had paid the situation because obviously, she's a patient today, isn't
00:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
paid today, right? But the other part of the conversation was he would give our minimum of 15,000, right?
00:19:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That was my understanding.
00:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my issue is that if you're going to do business, then you need to have clarity. And she said that he approached her kind of with how about I just pay you 10,000. And so that wasn't really, you know, a thorough negotiation that was just approaching children when she's not feeling the strongest anyway at the time, in terms of like performance and everything else. So I think it should be revisited because that's 33% less than what was agreed upon originally off the cuff, probably positioned on purpose as a result of how he was feeling about performance maybe. I don't know. But either way, I think that it would be who her and both of you to have a conversation to make sure that he's
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
where of who he's doing business with not people who are just going to be like oh yeah you know pay me whatever yeah and also today like I went there early at the hospital this is the earliest I've been to the point that this is so funny I haven't told you the nursing staff's like oh you're here early because they used to seeing me at you know after clinic so I go to the clinic person and then which actually works for me I'm an nighttime person I'm not a morning person that's okay that my peak like you said you have a peak time is this time from one to nine to ten is like I can like think anyways so yeah and then I came home and it took doing telemedicine and they called me and said that there's a doctor in Long Beach who apparently they're having issues with and that didn't come in and they're asking for me to cover I see And you know, I already I'm already home. went to the hospital early because my family are here. I adjusted my schedule. I said, I can help. I can do telemedicine on those patients. Yeah, I did. I said the boundary on that one.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. How'd you feel about that?
00:21:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I still feel bad. So I did. So that's why I texted her and says, and then I did hold her the managers. Like, I feel bad. I'm sorry. I can't help. But I went there early and I'm already home. I'm doing my telemedicine. And then I texted her. said, you know, I can do telemedicine on those those patients that are on their day in the clinic. Same thing. I just talked to them on the phone and he's like, it's okay, Dr. E. because the initial reason was Dr. E is in the OR and then it changed to now he's available.
00:21:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He can go because I can't.
00:21:50 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah.
00:21:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's not something good. Yeah.
00:21:54 - Chona Sweet, DNP
But yeah. But yeah. Now I feel, I feel good with the. facing now. I feel more even in the hospital, even in a clinic. I even hear myself, like my conversations with my patients would be, I know I am comfortable because I'm joking with patients. Like I'm making it very light, you know, and then I hear them laugh. Like I know they're in pain. It's already a pain clinic, like everyone's in pain, like why not just make it I hear myself like I have an NP that's shadowing me.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm a teacher.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP
it's good to hear myself relax. Like you said, like, what's that term that you said? Peace, but you're at peace, but powerful. So that's how I feel now, mostly. Like I don't, I mean, always see there's here in their situation where I feel like I just have to maneuver, but most of the time I feel there.
00:22:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a knee. to understand this because this will have applications everywhere else in your life. This is actually kind of my favorite thing about doing business the way that I do in the holistic approach is that when we learn certain perspectives, tactics, strategies, they have universal applications, they show up in other relationships, they show up in other places in life. That shift in how you feel is because you owned everything. You owned the schedule, you owned the contract, you owned the path, you owned the purpose and so now you're owning time in the clinic. Like the the fact that clinic experience became similar to hospital because like you were happy there and whatever in this short of time and the only thing that happened, it was not external, nothing else happened, is you just bought in and decided for yourself, I am going to be the architect. That was the conversation we had. know that that resonated with you, like you get to create what you want as an experience. Now, what I expected was, you know, maybe less time or something like that. just, you're blowing me away with how fast you're having this switch. I know that it's possible, but most people don't learn this this quickly, Jonah.
00:24:27 - Chona Sweet, DNP
So I know myself that it's the consistency that I know I have to work on every day. So I just need to like really be consistent. But innately, I feel better. I feel like more in control. Like I, that's the switch I think, because obviously three, I kind of like, remember you told me, like give yourself three months, six months. So I'm kind of giving myself, okay, three months this week. So I feel better, like I can.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That, it's that first 90 day. It's so weird. that it's almost magical around these like three months type of intervals. But okay, so you you said, Oh gosh, what was the word? Because I want to say, I want to add in accountability.
00:25:14 - Chona Sweet, DNP
You talked about ownership and accountability and ownership are kind of the same thing, but it's not necessarily people can own things and not really act accountable.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's really what you did is you were accountable for the outcome for how you feel. And rather than, because remember I asked you a couple of weeks ago, why are you doing this? you're like, even last week, I'm starting to track up time. But you're like, because I have to. I said, but do you really have to? That that was the switch is that you don't have to. So it's the acknowledgement that I'm choosing to. And then you decided to choose, are you're going to show up? But for it to have the emotional impact that it has, that is awesome. And you talked about you just need to be consistent. So the best way to be consistent is to remind yourself of what the opposite felt like. Contrast is my favorite teacher, because you have kind of a before and after you have a this, then not type of anything.
00:26:24 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And the same as when you told me, like, how would it feel?
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remember this feeling? Yes.
00:26:31 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Like if it's not, how would it feel if it's not like this?
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or how would it feel to go back to like, running this?
00:26:39 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Right.
00:26:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I was really, I don't know if I wanted it.
00:26:42 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Right. I was definitely driving the charting. But the moment except that, especially the clinic one, the clinic one. But now I am just, you know, I do it at the same time with the patient and definitely being more efficient. It's a balance. being present, making the patient feel that they're seen, heard, know, all these things, it's a balance and not just in the computer me typing and I can type without looking.
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just thought of something and I want to point this out too because it has been a few weeks since you've mentioned anything about a language barrier or feeling like you can't write properly or anything. hasn't even been part of the conversation and I want you to notice that because in our lives and we all do as we we look for excuses that we can make to make ourselves feel good about why we're not doing what we can and it doesn't mean that they aren't real reasons. When we use them as crutches friction points valid issues. But when we allow them to become the thing that prevents us from getting to what we want to get to, then that's when I would call them an excuse and a cross for why we can't do things.
00:28:11 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And you haven't mentioned that for a few weeks. I mean, I still do, especially when I do lean, and especially if I let Mark lead it and Mark would say, honey, tenses, this tenses, you know, but it's what I needed to know to get better. So, and like I have, I was actually telling you last night, I was reading the notes that the N.P. that I am training. And she also have a lot of, you know, tenses problems. And I am, I need to identify that that's good, I'm getting better. And hopefully I can like help her too. But. Americans are the same as you trying to learn other people's languages because it's so Yeah, no, I feel good that it all there's a lot of feel good and, you know, experience. ends and I take that the negative ones I just let it just go like I have a patient today she's grumpy and he's asking me I don't he's she's mad because I decreased her medication because she's embarrassing she had an episode that she stopped breathing because she took all the in the hospital so and I told her I have to decrease this medication and I found I noticed myself that I'm more assertive not necessarily aggressive especially with narcotics I have to be I cannot you know yes you can make that decision too but I have unfortunately for narcotics like we have to start coming off of this because you're going home like that's the line I have to tell them so I feel I'm comfortable with that because it is my experience that's kicking in but anyways the patient told me that the answer is like the of any constipation I just want to make sure she's not constipated with the right he said you know you know I have Crohn's right yes and Crohn's could be both constipation and diarrhea. Right. Yeah, it's like, because that's a stupid question. That's what I showed. So again, I did not knew, like I've had patients like this. In the past, yes, it was bothering me, but now it's like, OK, well, I will leave everything the same. OK, you have a good day. So I just left, and it doesn't, and the ones, the when ones would be like, the patients would say, I want to follow you or your clinic. So I would give them my card. it's a good feeling, like, but you live in North Ridge, like, it's far. It's like, that's fine. I will see you in Huntington, fish. Like, it's a good feeling to have. So yeah, definitely the ego booster, like, OK, I'm I feel good, like, somewhere else.
00:30:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, that transition is amazing, that you were able to get something similar to how you felt about the hospital with clinic patients. I mean, but that, all of it was you. Every single part of that was inside of you. You made that happen. So remember,
00:31:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
we also talked about probably a couple months ago just you being the author of your own story and you having the power like we've used architecture but author and it's important I think sometimes to just kind of visualize it just just to remember how powerful you are in creating everything around you the way that you want to and especially when it's you know when you're looking to be of service rather than just like then as if everybody but like right not to get what you want but also give I think that that's amazing so yeah giving something and getting something because I'm giving it the best feeling because I know that I'm helping with their pain but I have patience that the other day was crying because I'm really really grateful is like yes I take that yeah before I'm like oh and I'm worried about I'm like yes yeah I am they give it like in my head like give it to me yes I will because we need that we need to know that we're a value more useful and we need to know that the
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
work that we do matters that it's recognized that and it's reciprocal you right probably like look how you're so kind to me and you're so like thank you so much I appreciate you so much like I need that we we all need that so you give and you get right even reciprocity is huge right so I think that in terms of just like how you're showing up on a technical level please keep reporting the wins because that means that I know that you're observing it right thinking about what you're doing why you're doing it how you're doing it so it's a very simple system to keep us on track of growth and evolution on on a technical operational level right so then now we can start kind of getting into what is the system for getting new clients and starting to work the business angle of things because I know that well let's see the the the marketing kind of growth angle of things and operationally, functionally, you're on that and we can just kind of keep massaging and nurturing that as we go. So, and I don't know how much Mark can be here for that type of conversation.
00:33:13 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I mean, Mark introduced me to a couple of people, really the only thing that have a, what's the term, not a return, but after the meeting, after the Mark introduced me, is really have us. He gave me two clients, but other than that, I didn't, I don't have any, but again, I think it's too early. I don't know. I know Mark says that he is holding on to Christian, group, right, honey, like, you're supposed to reach out to Loretta. Yes, yes, that one. So, okay, I wanted to ask this because this is something new, well, new-ish to me. Reina is a chiropractor that worked with Mark, right? Are Reina, he has a wife that also they're, would you say, the office manager? Is he the office husband and wife with the car. Jaden and I have become friends because I met them through Mark. It's hard, I'm having, again, this is the business and switch that I haven't really familiar with. I don't know how to kind of navigate with her that hey, give me a client. But at the same time, also because with the friendship there, I feel a little weird about it, especially we haven't seen each other since April. And we keep on planning on seeing and it doesn't happen. And I know, you know, she would say, oh, I'm seeing you like, I just don't know how to approach it. Like, I feel weird about it. When did the business say, like, I know, like, ask? Mark, ask. He's her husband, Aretha, the chiropractor, and Aretha said yes, but I have to also reach out because it is my business.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, there's some things that you can consider and you'll learn different approach tactics and styles, and you'll learn them according to the different relationship dynamics that you have with people. But one thing is, if you have a friendship with somebody, don't we always want to do nice things for our friends, for the most part? Right. if you know you're going to be taking very good care of people, it's not just a favor to you, it's something good for their patients as well. And something that their patient is going to thank them for. Hey, thank you for referring me to Donna because she is so sweet and funny and made me feel comfortable and all of that. to remember that you're not asking for a favor or a handout, you're asking for something that serves everyone. And so approaching it could be, hey, you know, just updating her in the way that you're operating now, like, this is the thing that I'm doing. I'm really getting into pain management and well, you've been in pain management, but into personal injury and taking care of these patients and you feel like you're hitting a stride and you have a goal of really focusing on personal energy or injury. And, you know, just let me think about the words because my brain just went on the door. But, okay, so what is her role?
00:36:52 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Is it her husband or her or her husband and the chiropractor? And she, would you say, I'm the office manager?
00:37:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So most of his are small like just a couple of people and it'd be okay, so they work she works with them Operations he's the actual like position. Okay, a lot of those Providers.
00:37:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so and how do they choose who they're gonna send people to visit a location like proximity?
00:37:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's a couple of different ways Some attorneys will say you need to send it to this doctor because they have whatever relationship or you know reductions worked out Others they can just refer it out to So usually you're gonna pick doctors that are nearby you or we'll get them in sooner Okay, so one thing one of the pitch could be you know, hey if you have any patients that are you know in this area Also know that like I've got lots of room in my schedule so I can see people quickly especially if you've got something urgent Or I can do telemedicine too, and when they need procedure then I can bring them
00:38:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
in to the clinic.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And so, um, I would just say, like, look, I'm just looking to, to grow my client base, but, um, I also really enjoy doing what I'm doing. And I enjoy how, like, I really care about my patients. I'm having fun, but, um, you know, it doesn't grow if I don't put some effort into growing. So I thought I would let you know. And if that's something you'd be interested in discussing or there's a way that I can serve and help you, then let me know. But also, aside from that, still would love to visit with you and catch up and this, know, just, just to be aware of, like, hey, this is not the only reason I have any interest in you. Right. know, so you have to, I don't know how much of that is true, not true, whatever, but those are the things to think about is, is remember that there's real benefit. And it's benefit to everyone. So there's no reason not to ask. Um, if we don't ask, the answer is no.
00:39:03 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah. And also, like, I'm thinking, I realize, as you, you were talking, I think I need to dedicate one day a week, doesn't have to be this year or like next year. I don't know. I need to have something where I dedicate to visit the lawyers or the chiropractor that is in the right hand.
00:39:27 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
what you're doing.
00:39:28 - Chona Sweet, DNP
You're seeing them in person.
00:39:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And so you need to go and meet the people, you need to go make the phone calls and only do introductions. And if you don't follow up, if you don't go to events, if you don't do these things, then there's only so much a red engine in will send you everything they possibly can. All you have to do is ask and tell them what to do.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Your personality at events like that, like he's talking about, it'll, it'll happen pretty quickly. What you have to show up. Yes.
00:39:56 - Chona Sweet, DNP
That's what I need to do. are me not to show up on that. That's a recent event. We have to tell Tina about that recent event.
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, so even regardless, you're still new, like you just hit your strike. So you don't want to grow your marketing when you haven't stabilized your permit. And you basically just got there.
00:40:21 - Chona Sweet, DNP
So anything in the past that's not concerns on the choy group that I feel like, in a way, Mark is kind of threading lightly in the doctor pain doctors in that group because I think he's concerned. Why don't you say Han? Can you just say?
00:40:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, the issue is with part of chiropractic groups, like the choy group, there's a lot of pain doctors.
00:40:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's more every week.
00:40:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And so obviously, It comes to us, you know, mind our business, like, aggressively coming to us wanting our business because Okay, so it's an intermingling of a particular thing that's really strong me because I just say, look, we don't send our cases to China, which is mostly true. We really don't unless there's a really good reason, but, you know, it makes those doctors a little bit more in the fence, which makes me think, be directly and personal hit.
00:41:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so not every event is applicable, not every group is fine.
00:41:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, but go to anything you haven't showed up to stuff then.
00:41:36 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah, because they might think that Mark is gonna send all the cases to me, to our group, because I'm his wife, but there's a conflict of interest, but he has to, I feel bad in a way that Mark has to explain that to No, everyone, like, you first of all have to get out of the habit of feeling bad for things.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're a big, you grown up people doing it. Yes, so it's okay.
00:42:03 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I don't know how to approach that. And because we have a toy call every so often in a week and they know that a toy already said, you know, I mean, pain management.
00:42:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, well, I mean, are there other events and things that you're not doing business with Mark?
00:42:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's a low hang fruit, which means she's already, there's already these patients coming through from Dr. E stuff or whatever else and part of the deal with Dr. E is he's like, I'll just pay you on everything instead of trying to figure out who's I don't even know if that's true, by the way.
00:42:36 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Well, that's what you heard.
00:42:38 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
mean, you to have a conversation, but let's just put that for a second. You have access, generally speaking to see what lawyers are attached to what cases. And that Dr. E does not see. And that is a really, really easy area to potentially reach out and grow that relationship of. We're going to get you reports and bills and 48. Of course, we're going to do these things that help separate you a little bit.
00:43:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one thing that we have Fuji doing now is he's spending two hours a week reaching out to people who have sent him cases in the past and we are ranking them. We talked about this last week, I think, ranking them according to. So we track all the doctors, all the cases that have been sent, the date of the most recent case and the date of the most recent contact with them, sending them, he's sending door to acting like that. Well, my point is creating, first of all, you have to establish the network, right? having a conversation and maybe it's something, maybe you attend events by yourself without art, maybe you take somebody else with you as a wing person, you know, if you don't want to go by yourself or whatever, because it's social, but- I can, you know, I'm introvert, but I can, I mean- I would say you're probably more ambiverr.
00:43:58 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah, no, I can.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and do it. It's just maybe not too hard are not doing all these things that you're doing. it could be like, I'm all on, but then I don't want to talk to anybody for three days.
00:44:08 - Chona Sweet, DNP
But that's what I was saying to you is that's exactly what I was thinking. I just you just say it. Like, I was thinking of dedicating one week, one day a week or a couple of hours, for example, Friday or something.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:44:22 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I don't know.
00:44:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't might find that it works better to do like an hour, two or three days a week or like a couple hours or hour and a half, whatever. At minimum hour, throughout the week, because what you'll find is that there's a rhythm to other people's schedules and you'll learn to tap into it, then you know, maybe it's around lunchtime, maybe it's around the end of the day, maybe it's a Tuesday or a Thursday rather than Friday. You know what I mean? Like, you'll find a rhythm. But if you're not moving your call and contact times around, you won't find what that kind of good thing is. Also, you can pay attention to intuition. because I really believe intuition is powerful, like if you get that feeling like, you know what, I should have reached out to so-and-so, reached out to so-and-so.
00:45:06 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I don't know if I told you to have a case manager, apparently his right hand, and her right hand. I think he's very nice. So I told her I wanted to go see her in the office, and she said, oh, you going to our Christmas party in December, something I forgot? And I think it's a day that we're leaving. But yeah, no, I think I'm trying, really think, I mean, no rushing that relationship. I would text her and say, hey, can I call it? So every time we talk, it's very like this, it's very like we, you know, we talk about, but here's, hey, that's what remember the trigger point I did for the point that's theirs. That's awesome. And then I did it that day, and I turned it in less than 24 hours.
00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like Mark said, the way that you stand out, first of all, is going to be your personality and your energy. It's awesome. Not everybody is awesome. Most people suck. I'm just kidding. Right. That's just how it is. But when on top of it, you communicate clearly, you set expectations of this is how I'm going to take care of you. And then you do what you say you're going to do. And you actually take care of them according to those expectations. Then there, know, it's a Pavlovian response, right? I talked to Chona, number one, I feel good, two, I know my patients are going to be taken care of. And three, I don't have to worry about any of that. So you're going to train them on that response. But the thing that you have to remember is that has to be consistent. The first time you break that habit, you lose that Pavlovian response that responds to you. But you can engineer it. It sounds manipulative and bad, but it's not. It's like I just choose to be this type of person and show up at this person. I'm conscious of the reward for showing up as this kind of person. So,
00:47:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yes you remind me like I want to message them like happy holiday.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. And so something that you might do is like set a note for yourself or a reminder for yourself because it's very easy for that to not be top of mind and then for you to remember at a time when it's not really a powerful time, right? they're personal time and you don't want to do it then or it's too late at night or too early. You know what I mean? Like you so so make sure that you have some kind of reminder system when you get a thought in your head. This is who I need to reach out to and nurture but aside from nurturing with the amount of contact you have right now being so small, you need acquisition as well as nurturing, right? So look, have conversations about events, about places you can go where you can meet people and kind of balance both of them out. So new people can get very overwhelming. It's very difficult. to manage a lot of new relationships well because you really have to get to know people. There's a lot to remember. And that goes back to the same thing as how difficult it was just getting started in the clinic. was new people, new patients, new processes, that stuff fries your brain. So you want to kind of put everything in certain boundaries, right, so that you're not exceeding your mental capacity for learning new things because you're still going to be learning new things operationally. Don't learn too many new people too fast.
00:48:34 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Pace yourself. The terminology, like I honestly, the defense, know, like the terms of money. There's a lot of personal injury term. I'm still trying to understand. I know the limits. I'm learning that and but still.
00:48:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You may also want to keep like a little spreadsheet of terms and what they mean. And so when you ask them, just put it in Google Docs, which you can open up from your phone or a note, but I would use Google Docs because it's really easy to just write them. It's the kinetic effort in memory that's just going to help you retain the memory better so that you understand it. But also, if you put it in your own language, it's the same reason why they had us write out vocabulary words because actually doing it, you know, retain it better. So, if you want to have to struggle less mentally, right? Less mental fatigue, less mental lag time, effort, drain, whatever, you know, use little systems like just writing key things down. If this word comes up and it's important to know and it might stall you in how you have to handle something because you don't fully understand it, it's for taking the time to write down to get clear on. For me, if I have to get clear on a new concept, I got to ask like a question this way, this way, this way, and this way and kind of triangulate what it means because the scenario will show up differently at different times where the same world applies, but maybe I didn't recognize it because it showed up a little different. So I asked questions from multiple perspectives when I'm learning something new so that I really wrap my head all the way around it.
00:50:26 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I will, you know, again, I know I have bouts of energy and I know that the consistency, I just need to be consistent, but I have a lot of ideas and I, not ideas, but plans, but it's just, it just have to follow through, like I need to make sure that I attend events with or without more, probably better without because I know that I need to just be able to just do it on my own. I just don't know how to, I don't know, but should I introduce like I'm new or no, I don't
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel when I say new, I already feel my confidence coming down. No, no, no. So I'm growing. I'm growing a business or something like that. No, what advice?
00:51:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You guys are now opening your practice to take PI where before you.
00:51:17 - Chona Sweet, DNP
There you go.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:51:18 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Perfect.
00:51:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll make sure to do that and then or expanding rather than opening.
00:51:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Either one. Yeah.
00:51:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think actually expanding specifically just doesn't necessarily make it feel so new.
00:51:30 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Opening could still feel new.
00:51:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. The reason for it is to underscore another one of the special things, which is they're clean because most of their experience has been with health insurance. Yeah. And from everyone else.
00:51:43 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Less than 10 percent.
00:51:45 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
these from them like last night, like this is what I get slammed at three, four or five times a day from like pain doctors of we can get you in this state where you're gonna have reports in two or three days. Like this is what everyone's doing. So how do you stand apart?
00:51:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:52:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Growers it's this is what you think about me.
00:52:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so to that point though and to the point of getting fluid with it this might sound corny but role-playing and just kind of having these conversations with Mark a few times and he's smart enough to be able to switch it up and you know play a different persona, ask you some different questions, you up or whatever but same thing with driving right it's that experience of that muscle memory of your lips forming those words and brain doing that if you practice it several times when you go get there you're going to be more comfortable doesn't matter that it's not Mark the scenario in the conversation will be familiar enough that you will be able to flow through it and that confidence is a huge selling factor when you can speak clearly with confidence and you can hit all the points that he's talking about that makes a difference to them it will resonate. with them powerfully and also clearly which means they will probably remember it and remember you and then the other thing is you always want to wrap it up with a call to action like something specific here's what I want you to do and that might sound like that's pushy that's whatever like so if you have a patient in this zip code right or if you have a patient that needs to be treated in 24 hours or whatever call me here's my number I will get to them with an X amount of time right so first you gave them who you are what you do what the benefits are working with you why you're different here's what you need to do when you need me here's how you get a hold of me and a reminder this is how great I'm gonna take care of you right right now I'm yeah because imagine you're that person and you've got a need that comes out from time to time and somebody hits you with that and they told you All the things that you want to hear about what you're going to need when that time happens and then they tell you Reach out to me. They give you their contact info, and then they remind you like how great it's gonna be you're gonna be like You're thinking about that person.
00:54:15 - Chona Sweet, DNP
They're on your mind So did I tell you that when um, I don't know I just remember On that lunch event with the attorney, did I mention that to you that I was able to get the phone the contact info of the office manager the case manager, right? And then the I really milk on the fact that it was Filipino. It's like another Filipino There's two of them so I reach out to them and I talk to them for a long time and they gave me that info and and the Filipina says So you're marketing for them. It's like no, not I'm I'm an expectation, was like, oh, okay.
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They thought I'm marketing. So I feel like, no, this is my business, I'm partnering with Audrey, but this is my business. And that ownership, especially if you're talking about to people that you have any kind of bonding with, whether it's nationality or beliefs or it's another woman or whatever.
00:55:23 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I'm a person, I will not to manipulate, but in a way, yes, but I genuinely wanted to kind of.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that that's manipulation. Yeah. I mean, I think that that's the nature of camaraderie, like when you, you're, you're, you're another country that's technically, you know, American, but still like, yeah, I'm happy, I am happy, especially not in the hospital, because all of us are, they're they're so nice. Do you like Joe Corey?
00:55:56 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Of course.
00:55:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. He cracks me up.
00:55:59 - Chona Sweet, DNP
So he's like everything. but he's a nurse or a doctor laughing that's why when I see the um I see the um what to call that when I see in another field like in a lawyer like I'm happy I feel happy but yeah no I'm well and they feel that way so I just I just don't want you to feel like you're being manipulative you're that's true joy that you had I am sure right no I'm happy to like we're talking our language right away right let's talk a lot right yeah I really pick someone right why not you it's not manipulating it's going to pick a doctor why isn't yeah yeah if they don't like you like it it didn't like you whether you're Philippine or not they're not going to go with you so yeah yeah right yeah but you're very cool I just very I just really need to you know like you said have doctor how doctor for just doing like foster nourish that what's that time that you like that relationship, I need really need to know.
00:57:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure, you could think of like just massage, but manage like just being intentional about it and but scheduling time and being intentional about it. So what I would like to see you do, you know, this is holiday week, so whatever, but when you're thinking about it, I want you to talk to Mark, you know, figure out what events you might be able to go to and go to separately, or one of you, but whatever. Something that is for you. Okay, so I want you to think about these two tracks, one acquisition and two nurturing, right? that's more like retention, but it's also just getting as much out of each one as you can. But I need you to always remind yourself so that you don't feel icky about it, because it's very easy, especially for women to feel icky about marketing or selling themselves. that you care about your patients, you take good care of them, you show up in a timely manner, you're watching out that they're not abusing their drugs, you're watching out for drug interactions, you know that not every doctor is looking for drug interactions. Some of them are out there killing people because they're not paying attention to their records, you're paying attention, they're, you bring everything to the table, Jonah.
00:58:25 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I just realized that I can actually do the luncheon on my own, right, hun? I know I'm not the anesthesiologist doing the procedures, but I can do the lecture that they're doing because I can actually say I don't have my anesthesiologist here to do procedures because they're working and you want that in a doctor to make sure that they're busy. I don't know, that's how I'm going to play it because they're not going to be there in the luncheon, I can be there and I can give the lecture, right hun?
00:58:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think they care enough whether it's the anesthesiologist or you. We drink with you.
00:59:01 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah, they just like the food.
00:59:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They just like that.
00:59:03 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I don't know what the luncheon learn is. So I'm just the lunch and learn is like we like what we did with this attorney we just law firm. We get we have a provided them lunch at that one is Persian food. It's a Persian firm Persian white firm.
00:59:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's an upper.
00:59:20 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Armenian?
00:59:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Nope.
00:59:22 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Yeah. Then why do we order Persian food? Well, anyway, that's Dr. E who ordered that. But lunch and then while they're having lunch, then we talk about our practice and say these are what we offer. These are the procedures that we can do for your patients. And I can answer those questions. Like I'm not the one who do it, but I know it. I know it.
00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I can do that. That's all they care about.
00:59:47 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Can you get them the information they're looking for? Yeah, so I can do that. I don't need Dr. Eda because he may or may not show up anyways because he's always busy.
00:59:56 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The things I care about is can I get my building records quickly? Are you Commending procedures and how hard are you to deal with on the back end. Those are their three. Yeah, our buildings We don't have other was that term that you send you don't sell But the reductions have to come quickly and make sense.
01:00:14 - Chona Sweet, DNP
No, it's not our lean. What is that thing? We don't have a third party.
01:00:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
We don't sell your papers.
01:00:20 - Chona Sweet, DNP
What it is. Okay, so we do our own billing Again all the time when you get that stuff from him write it down. Yes You you need to have some note cards anytime.
01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a conversation or on your phone like an iPhone note with a clear title These are the benefits of working with us. So anytime mark says this is what they need to hear and they want to know write it down This is the difference between taking six months to a year to getting really good at pitching delivering getting those referrals growing your business It's the details of how well you capture and You and memorize and then master the delivery of the points and the benefits of working with you. And then that's how you leapfrog their faster. It's just really good at understanding and then communicating it clearly, confidently, powerfully, and then following up with exactly what you said you'll do. The thing that will gain you and lose you business the most is whether you do or do not do what you say you'll do.
01:01:33 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Exactly. In this doctor and in this law firm, one of our assistants surely says, we give you the notes in 24 hours. In my head, it's like, that's not the practice right now. That's not how you guys operate in my head. And the doctor followed it by, this is why we all the playing patients. So, I mean, I only see what they give me and Dr. E. So I'm in charge on that and that's what he needs right now. He needs someone to because he's super busy.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But remember that your focus is showing up to be a business partner rather than an employee and a helping right he can hire an employee.
01:02:21 - Chona Sweet, DNP
So just remember that you're always aware of dynamic and the partnership and what you're really therefore you're not really there to be Dr. E's right hand and support person right or there to grow Chona's business and make it kind of feel like that it feels that way every every issue with that for example new doctor he cannot prescribe yet through our system. I'm always included in that email like they and they will ask me to can you find I can help people once in a while but I can't be reason why I'm not in for you best.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just wait, wait, what did you say because I want to make sure I heard it right?
01:03:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
For right now, that would be a good reason to apply to increase what he's paying her per month.
01:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. that's exactly what I was going to say. Like that level of responsibility, leadership, the value that you're bringing. Where's my 15,000 on me? You earned it. You're earning it already. So that's the thing I've said a few times, but you really need to understand what is the value that you bring to the table? What doesn't exist without you? You've already brought a lot of that and it helps his reputation, but it also helps his stress levels and it's confidence knowing that it's being taken care of. So you need to remember that and you need to know that there's a real monetary value, number one that he's obtaining from it. And then you can obtain.
01:03:58 - Chona Sweet, DNP
So, yeah, you'll have that.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
conversation and let me know how it goes.
01:04:02 - Chona Sweet, DNP

I've been working with him for three and a half years, so I know he doesn't really take weeks off.
01:08:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP
Okay. So yeah, I would rather earn, make some money too. Like I, that's fine with me.
01:08:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
During those weeks, um, since you're not going to have like a crazy schedule or anything, we, we, um, we might be able to meet and talk. Otherwise, let's just do making a strategic plan for events and.
01:09:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP
anywhere. That's what I was thinking, like I really want to. I don't like social gatherings, especially, you know, but I can talk enough. I'm comfortable talking to people and them talking to me.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So put it in the same perspective as you don't like getting up in the morning, but it's an end means to the end that you want, right? And it's like this, right?
01:09:27 - Chona Sweet, DNP
There's just this small chunk, you've gotten through it, and then you get what you want out of it.
01:09:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So nurturing those conversations once you've made them is not as difficult, right? Because mostly that can be done and it's not big gatherings. It's more personal, more intense.
01:09:41 - Chona Sweet, DNP
And even if it's like big gatherings, like, you know, I've been, you know, being with Mark, I've been with gatherings, although we always joke that I'm his accessory.
01:09:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, kind of cute.
01:09:55 - Chona Sweet, DNP
I'm an expensive accessory. So yeah, no, I get to do that, but I know that I I'm definitely feeling more. I'm not just confident. I'm feeling more what's a term. I don't know that I cannot think of the term, but I'm more motivated to we need to I want to make I not one. feel like I need to make this work. Like I want to I want to make, you know, good money too.
01:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. okay. So for me next week and then you'll be on vacation for a couple of weeks.
01:10:35 - Chona Sweet, DNP
then what was you?
01:10:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the next Wednesday is January 1st, which is not the first day.
01:10:42 - Chona Sweet, DNP
On that week, if you want, we can move it to like, I'm okay doing my first, but I know you're, you know, you need to spend time with family.
01:10:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, yeah, but my kids will sleep in a lot and it's it's nobody deal holidays are they're they're kind of mellow not the
01:11:00 - Chona Sweet, DNP

Can you hear me?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, can you hear me? Who has his new baby.
00:00:15 - mark sweet
I know how exciting.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, they are so cute.
00:00:19 - mark sweet
All of them. Yeah, I like.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love them. They're awesome. I told you I got to meet Esther right on the first call. No. Yeah, so we were talking and I thought I had seen somebody walking in the background, but the background was blurred. So it was hard to tell. And then he's talking about family stuff and he's like, yes, she's my wife. She's right here. And so she came and she sat down and she just talked to me and told me how excited she was for the coaching and. told me, you know, stuff about him and it was it was not what normally happens, but I loved it because like families are really what I'm thinking about most of the time. I'm just getting to it to the business. It's just weird. But anyway, that's me. So that was really cool.
00:01:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. And she's super techy, super smart.
00:01:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you said that. And she's incredibly gorgeous.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Oh my gosh. I just like the whole family.
00:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah, they have amazing energy. Sorry.
00:01:36 - mark sweet
wish I had like, you know, 200 of those funds for you because you would be the happiest person in the world.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I would be so happy. A few and far between on people like him that exist, unfortunately. Yeah, but that's why you learn to recognize them as gems when you get them. They're like, yeah, you're not normal. And my favorite thing, one of my favorite things to tell people like that. is how special they are, because a lot of times they just have no idea, they just think, you know, whatever, they usually think way less of themselves than the people who are way worse. All right, let me get my notes.
00:02:17 - mark sweet
Yeah, the other new one, I'm talking to her husband, I guess, on Tuesday?
00:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like tomorrow Tuesday?
00:02:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, it looks more like Tuesday.
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He makes me like, what day is it?
00:02:28 - mark sweet
don't know.
00:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how long have they been in business together?
00:02:37 - mark sweet
Since like 2012. Wow. And then in law school, he did not pass the bar.
00:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did not pass the bar? Like, ever or then?
00:02:50 - mark sweet
He's not a licensed lawyer at this point, so yeah.
00:02:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Are they both Asian?
00:02:57 - mark sweet
No, he's white.
00:03:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with that last name.
00:03:02 - mark sweet
Uh it's all under her name.
00:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. Oh okay.
00:03:06 - mark sweet
I've married or what the deal is.
00:03:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:03:09 - mark sweet
They have three kids together so.
00:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm trying to get the month to date. Let's see.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
We'll see what comes of that. It's interesting if nothing else.
00:03:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was when I was talking to Fuji. I've been doing more so I typically don't do video calls but I've been trying to incorporate them more often especially with newer people just to get kind of like a baseline reading on people. So again that's how I got to see. Actually I was an on video at that time so Esther didn't get to meet me but anyway it adds a different layer of connection. It's just good. Where is my document? I was trying to get them. I have three minutes to get ready and then you were there early. I'm like, oh, just like Damon. Let's see. Oh, what I want to do is because I keep asking the question and I don't want to keep asking the question. Oh, I do have it. Okay, I just need to update this. So sweet little attorneys, who is doing Missouri cases? Does that just you or Patrick?
00:04:25 - mark sweet
and some just kind over to seeing a little bit.
00:04:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so he's got those three cases. So let me screen share real quick and if you can just correct anything that you see for.
00:04:46 - mark sweet
So there's no more Robert, Robert's not okay.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make right. I need to have you in here for what you do.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
You got to add Sam, New Mexico.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's right there. Okay, and Hank does what? Huh? Yeah, it turns on. Okay, and what states do you do?
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Everything.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everything. So Arizona, California, New Mexico, Washington. Missouri.
00:05:32 - mark sweet
Yep.
00:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was it. That was the whole process. wasn't where you didn't know. I don't know that.
00:05:41 - mark sweet
We've been everywhere. I'm also licensed in Texas.
00:05:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay.
00:05:48 - mark sweet
Samantha is too. Right.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Texas. that's just you.
00:05:54 - mark sweet
Okay. We have her applying for Illinois, Colorado.
00:05:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. So let me. But that is. You're getting questions. And Nick is working on Washington and he's going to take the Arizona bar in February.
00:06:20 - mark sweet
Patrick is going to take the Nevada bar in February and Hank is going to take the Georgia bar in February.
00:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Yeah, because I was just thinking about this earlier this morning. Um, especially after seeing your the, you know, the month to date and looking at. where, or did I paste that in here yet? on a second. Oh my gosh, zoom is in my way. There it is. Copy. Just thinking about what we're working on in terms of leveraging existing assets and resources but expanding revenue and growth and not necessarily having to get new lead sources because that's what's difficult. So this is our strategy of expanding out into the states. But then I was thinking about making sure that I can track, first of all, who's in each of the states and the way I spelled that. And then just kind of looking at, so like we had three Missouri this month. And when we're talking about the pace that we've been growing, that three, know, that starts getting us some momentum. Even though it's not huge, we're only halfway through the month, that's significant. we started, if we got six more in Missouri every month, which I don't know that we would, but you know, it's just, it's just talking about the potential math, not the probable math. Sure. Looking at that. then also though, who's in Missouri, so if it's just Patrick, but you can do Missouri also, right?
00:08:36 - mark sweet
I'm the only one licensed in Missouri.
00:08:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So how is it that Patrick can do it because he's working it up and you're technically the attorney?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah. So like, you know, Sam's not licensed in Washington, but she's working on Washington in case it's undermining.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark. Okay, because I want to also kind of keep an eye on the ceiling that might be arriving and reading so we don't have a dashboard for this type of thing so I'm just gonna kind of use a spreadsheet and this is going to have to improve over time but with you know not February is a ways away but we've got how many bars coming up at least three three yeah so three potential will see easy is not at all like end of May if they passed or not
00:10:00 - mark sweet
it takes a while.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. about a year. And that's so Georgia, Nevada is not new though.
00:10:11 - mark sweet
You waved in Nevada, right? Nope. I can't. We've been in Nevada.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
We had a Nevada bar issue, which is probably why it's on your head.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So nobody is in Nevada.
00:10:25 - mark sweet
You can't do Nevada cases right now, right?
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Correct. Okay. So Nevada would be a new, newly opened. Yep. Can anybody work in Georgia right now? Nope. Okay. So Georgia would be a new open.
00:10:39 - mark sweet
And then it would be brand new Illinois would be brand new.
00:10:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So I'm also glad though that we're getting started with the attorneys and it would be good. You know, I don't know when still, but talking with the intake team. Just building up. up kind of that momentum because if we're talking about getting into one, two, four, five new states in May, potentially.
00:11:10 - mark sweet
Yes, potentially.
00:11:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we're shooting for it even if it's three new states and let's say the three new states could get us six new cases every month each. If we got 18 new cases retainers every month and that would be. So matter is matters everything and retainers are because there's people retainers.
00:11:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? Matters are retainers.
00:11:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:44 - mark sweet
What Mark? Incidences is when it's the lower number.
00:11:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Incidences is the number of right? Right, right. Okay. Okay. Got it. Right. So, um, Anyway, but if we're getting, I'll just stick with retainers, because that's the number that we're tracking for the most part, like 18 new retainers every month. And then there's the compounding effect of those are open cases that are being worked for a period of a few months actively before they, you know, get to where they start to slow down a little bit. With the amount of attorneys that we have right now, like that, that ceiling will get there faster. So I just want to start plotting the course out and thinking about it because we're also still trying to increase how many retainers we're getting each month. Now, while everybody's still pretty busy right now. Lorenz is kind of capped. So anyway, just making sure that I'm getting all of the data points and that we're really looking at everything all the way around and massaging what we can trying to get and optimizing and getting more. out of what we have leveraging it, but also anticipating that at some point there's probably going to be another ceiling. We're going to have to probably hire other attorneys, but I don't know.
00:13:14 - mark sweet
Anyway, so I was just thinking about 150 retainers a month for you now. We've got five main pods, I'll call it.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the thing with that though is that's a very basic and generic number spread across your pods when all your pods do not function the same and they don't all operate in same states.
00:13:37 - mark sweet
So while that I mean that math to me is like not even dirty that's just right so it's so we're just going to stay with Arizona. Arizona only goes busy enough to keep him solid. Hank with being relatively you know, we can give him other states to work on. He doesn't have to just only be Arizona. He's losing Arizona, he's licensed in Arizona, but you know, clearly he wants to take the Georgia bar and he's open to do another things. You don't know if he's been an attorney long enough that he can wave into some of these states, but if he does well in the Georgia bar, you can wave into some of these states as well. Okay. So, you know, I can see him eventually taking cases or New Mexico cases.
00:14:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Our short term issue is we're spending more we're bringing in, which is never good. So, you know, we Got to keep our group.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:15:09 - mark sweet
I'm waiting for it to catch up. know it will catch up. Give me now of cases that we're signing.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just. And that big settlement that you just had the dad not help.
00:15:20 - mark sweet
Balance about that gets us back to even plus 500 grand basically. So, I mean, it was in a good position. It's not like it's a bad position. But obviously I would hope that that money would have gone a lot further.
00:15:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, so if you forecast, if you, I mean, you can forecast at this point, right, to some to a pretty solid degree. So, what happens when you forecast it out, right? It's you should be able to say, Hey, like I just did this for us, right? I forecasted. that we will hit our subscriber ceiling, I forget what day I did this on, but it was 155 days from the day that I did it. And then at our meeting this morning, we are 30 shy of hitting that ceiling. And when that happens, that's it. We're not going to get any more revenue unless we change something, right? So in our scenario, I have to change new customer, the new customer metric, which is I'm working on that, right? That's the only path to growth. Same thing with you, right? The path to growth is more retainers. But in my forecast, our overhead doesn't change, right? So it's like, we just won't make more money. We lose customers, we make less. But if we say here, it's like, we're just going to get stuck. And what I figured out was when we zoomed out, like when I zoomed out, which will be different for you, right? When I zoomed out, was like, oh, really don't work. really just kind of stuck for lack of a bit of word or no, it's actually true. Like we're just stuck at around three million, you know, 2.8 to 3.2 million a year. Like we just float in and out of that zone, throwing in the global pandemic. So it's like, okay, if nothing changes, if actually not nothing, if that new customer metric does not change, nothing else will change, we can just stay like this. for you, it's like, okay, how do you forecast this stuff? Because this is the scenario, like, it just made me think of, oh, it's my buddies, even knows this. I don't think I told you the story. So in, yeah, in January, my buddies like, oh yeah, we're gonna triple the business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 60 days later, he was laying on top of stuff because he, and I swear, Tina, up. And it was, Because his, he forecasted improperly and like was using some math magic, some really happy math. I was like, Hey, man, I don't know about this. And within 60 days, he was asked out completely upside down, laid off after staff, and is now still playing catch up. So that was in March. And he's kind of, he's treading water now, but they're about to lay off like their number one salesperson. The benefit of it was, I mean, I don't know if there really was a benefit, I guess there was, is like, now he's really digging into like the inner numbers, right? He's not just looking at the surface level things. He's going deeper on these numbers. And he's also figuring out that certain processes don't work that great. But here, it's like, what's if you forecast that, what actually shows you what's going to happen. That's the concern I have it's like okay if I look when when when is that what is that horizon like oh yeah we're gonna be back we're gonna be in the black whatever you want to call it in 140 days because xyz is gonna happen based off of all this data I mean you have years and years with the data granted you do have growth that's happening over here but and never assume growth I would never unless rock solid yeah how'd we look at that looking at it if I use a hundred retainers and I would throw out the person outlier cases to me those aren't real those are just creepy yeah I can't rely on those no I'm looking at a hundred incidences or sorry a hundred retainers which were usually beyond but I think a hundreds of pretty solid number 15% between drop and sub-out rate which the real numbers 12 I'm using 15 as a
00:20:00 - mark sweet
conservative number. It consists of 85 cases that should pay out out of the market. If I use the $12,000 average fee, and I'm sure you remember we ran this a while ago, our average fee.
00:20:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep, I use 11, yep, 21.
00:20:19 - mark sweet
Yeah, let's use 12 grand again, conservative, that should put us a little over a million. Our monthly overhead is around a million. fluctuates from month to month, but that's around where our breakeven points.
00:20:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, that's before.
00:20:36 - mark sweet
Yeah, is that we've sent out?
00:20:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is your overhead increasing at the same rate? Like are you just creating more, but getting less, right? You create more revenue, but you're creating more overhead, right? Are these things just moving in conjunction? So your for your bottom line numbers going up, but that's it. you're not really making, you're not picking anything up for doing this other than more employees, more this, more that.
00:21:12 - mark sweet
Like, it's more, more, more, more, more, more, but what it's not more of is profit. Sure answer is yes. Long answer is yes with a butt. And the reason I'm saying Yes with what? A butt, because the answer is yes. But the more cases I have in my pipeline, the more value my firm has. The more I could theoretically decide tomorrow to stop advertising, right?
00:21:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
cut down people and The Salko model.
00:21:37 - mark sweet
Salko model. Two more cases you're bringing in the higher chances of getting one of those whales, right? Larger net. True. Catch a bigger fish.
00:21:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, so that's all, all right. So, I mean, obviously, the Salko model I get, but that's like this long-term play. Are you really? I do you really think you're going to do that?
00:22:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't even think you wanted to go that way. So let's definitely talk this out.
00:22:10 - mark sweet
No, it's that or you sell.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, value your firm is in your case.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. made the decision. I made the decision like 60, 90 days ago. Like when we got another PE firm come in and offer us a bunch of money, it wasn't enough money. But it was the first time ever that I was like, you know what? I would sell it now. So now I've shifted and my plan is to sell it in three years. Like I've set a time like in three years, I want to be I want to sell it. So I'm building it now and massaging it like getting I got this new bookkeeper and I'm getting a valuation done right now. We're setting up all new. We're setting up these docs. So I'm positioning it to sell and then I'm bringing in an advisor to help. to show me, hey, they sell these kinds of companies. So I'm engaging them now so that in three years, this thing is just shining and everything looks great. And then they're going to go selling. That's it. That's what I'm doing. It's happening. If it doesn't sell, I don't care. If I just make the business better, we make more money, that's not well and good. But my goal is really to sell it. If I just end up with a more profitable seven-figure business, oh, well. So I wonder if you should, I don't know, I mean, you could operate in those terms, right? And you'd be in this exact same position, right? be like, OK, well, I just made it all better and I'm going to keep it. But I'm doing all these things with this sort of thing in mind. And then what does that really look like? So for me, I know now, hey, I got to really figure out this new customer thing because that's where I'm going to add to the bottom line and therefore that's going to add to I know that that multiple whatever the multiple is that it's eight if I increase that metric that eight is worth more. The eight's only worth what it is right now like at a a 22 new customers a day average which is what we average no no matter what it's that times eight or that whatever the multiple is right so I go okay great if I want that multiple to have more value than I need to change this one metric so I'm only focused on figuring out how to change that metric so for you it's like what what does constitute the value right what does it what what would be the best looking version of it in three or four or five years whatever your horizon is and then how do you start to do things now to make it that then right is it and maybe it is you just keep doing this thing where you're going grow grow grow grow and like your profit margin doesn't change at all because that's how the multiple works there. I don't know, but something to think about.
00:25:08 - mark sweet
It's definitely something to think about. And again, the numbers that gave you were the most conservative numbers, right? the like Rosie everything's perfect. I use the 12% drops about rate, which is our actual rate, and that number should go down, and our 12,000, 684, 99 number, you know, now we're at 1.116. We make 100 grand a month, give or take, which, you know, it's not like that's insane, but it's not terrible. And that's not going to any referral fees or any big cases. So to me, it's keep growing and keep looking at what our average settlement is in these states. And are there any outliers that throw that number off? And then does it make sense, you know, take Washington, for example, does Washington still make sense in two or three years? Part of the problem is, We're spending a lot on the advertisement and it's taking a while to chase the tech.
00:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Is 10%, I mean, that's a 10 profit margin. Like, is that a good number? I don't even know. I don't know what the math is in this world.
00:26:16 - mark sweet
It should be about 20%.
00:26:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
10% when you're going through growth is so no.
00:26:22 - mark sweet
20% to 20% to a third is where you're really trying to be, depending on if you can do and what not. I would be perfectly fine with a 20% profit margin. I think that is fine.
00:26:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right. So are you not getting 20% now due to operational inefficiencies? Like, what's preventing you from getting 20% now? Is it because you're on this track of like, hey, that's just not possible because we're doing this thing? Or is it like, oh no, that should be possible right now.
00:26:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it your incentive program?
00:26:53 - mark sweet
The incentive program is not helping.
00:26:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have high payroll.
00:26:58 - mark sweet
Okay. Our payroll is high. It should be like 25 to 28% and it's closer to like 37%. So our payroll is high because of current incentive package, right? that's mostly the attorneys. That's really where the money is going.
00:27:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:27:17 - mark sweet
Yeah. And obviously our advertising costs is high too. We're getting it better under control. But if I look at it for the year, we had some swings and misses. That we lost money on. Yeah. If I was better.
00:27:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. the payroll is like fixed.
00:27:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the real problem.
00:27:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Marketing's variable payroll is fixed. And then if the goal is this longer term thing, what you know, right? And I know, because I know the talk a model is that you would just eliminate marketing altogether because your firms then subsiding strictly on referrals. And blah, blah, blah, blah. And brand, right? Pray to some degree. That's interesting. So I've been going. I'm back and forth with the ad sergely guys because they're like, they don't understand why the conversion rate for sweet loss so much worse for lack of a better term than everyone else. Right. So that's why I was late because I was lacking with him. So he told me that he, and he showed me like all the metrics of these other firms. He's just not showing me their names. The firm in Washington that is that multi-state firm like they're closing 30% of the leads like, okay, great. And then the other firms in other states, the average is 14% and ours with them is somewhere like five, which is what we keep seeing over and over and over. My argument to him that I wanted to bring to you that ties directly into what we just talking about is I'm telling him Mark's criteria is different. They're signing lower value cases and they just, they either doing it on purpose or they just don't know. And he's like, well, that doesn't make sense. I got no .
00:29:00 - mark sweet
but I go it makes sense only in this way and I don't know if this is smart and so I'm gonna run this by mark and weirdly we just kind of kind of covered it like maybe they're doing it on purpose because they're trying to expand their user base right and that they're playing into this long-term model I don't believe that for a second because I think they're not doing the math it's not just that it's the difference between me and all these other firms is they look at is this a case and I made this one first started and a lot of the larger firms are guilty of this is this a case the answer that is yes for me it's is the lemon worth the squeeze and more often than not there is no for a lot of these other firms it's it's a case and it's a completely different mindset I could probably double what our retention rate is If I was not so picky, or I did not require so much information on fraud, I promise you that there are pieces where they don't know if there's insurance, they don't know any of the liability, they are more than like the property damage photos, and so they're drop rate.
00:30:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I think is happening. And I'm about to prove it to him, because I was pointing this out to him said, look at the turn down rates, there's a distinct, I don't know, no treatment, no injury. Unless somehow we're getting these very special leads, that exact percentage exists across everything, they are signing those. And my guess is if I go and do the math, let's say that our conversion rate with them is 7%, guess what the other 7% is going to be, those two reasons. And I'll be like, dude, if the math is right there, they're signing them. And it shouldn't be and that's the difference and so in that context It's like this is what I was saying to my go and I also told them the 30% Washington I'm like dude, they're referring those out. We don't count those. Yeah, they get tracked But they don't count because they're not real money. It's not a real real retainer So if you take those out of theirs That's probably gonna drop them down to like the 14% average my guess is that they I'm not my guess I saw it they'd refer a ton of them So they're signing crappy ones and that was must be extra crappy and then they were throwing them out. So with him like, okay, let's get to What is the cost of working with you to get us a Sweetlaw retainer, right? Because these aren't all equal in any stretch of the strictly with it, right? So yeah, I was like, there's no way there's no way they're signing them as part of a grander strategy They just don't know I I this, I know he's not going to have the answer, but they tell you their average value per retainer because I can guarantee it's lower than ours. And if it is, then that proves my point, but I think I can prove my point doing that analysis just as it's late.
00:32:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, it just makes sense. And again, if you've got larger firms, they're signing it, they've got capacity. It's the same reason we're referring up is they're getting signed up and getting referral fees. It's not a case, right? Yes. For me, it's a lot of work or lot of...
00:32:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It won't math out. It won't math out.
00:32:37 - mark sweet
Yeah. takes a lot more labor to get that out than one that contains a lot more issues.
00:32:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep. And it will lower, it would probably lower your overall average on the real stuff because you're people are running around working on stuff.
00:32:51 - mark sweet
So it's going to bring down the whole thing. However, every now and then there's a diamond in the room, which is why it won't do anything.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. But it's gotta be super rare.
00:33:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's kind of like, I don't know, it just seems like gambling math to me where because you have less control of it and it's not because it's not the norm because it's an outlier. And just thinking about, there's multiple things. Again, the SACO model has a much longer runway. So one of the things and the math activities we could should do would be to look at that. What does that runway look at? What are the variables? What, what does it look like to get there? So I like to reverse engineer. What does it look like when we're there? What's the difference here to there? What are the steps that would have to happen in order to. get there what's the nearest step take that step and it works better reverse engineering because you know what it it that's just the definition right so starting to do it the other way it gets really confusing and you can make some really bad choices but then when you look at so reverse engineer where you want to go come back what does it look like what are those steps what's just too big of a leap to take because it's too risky too much change too much volatility in the business obviously you want to step it down from whatever that is that you can mitigate risks along that path but the longer you play the game of i want to take as many as possible within the realm that you already have right that you won't take all garbage stuff so that you have the a greater opportunity to catch the big fish. You're playing two different games. You can't play both games at the same time. So at some point, one has to become the priority goal and one has to be sacrificed. And those decisions should be made mathematically. But we haven't even begun to outlive the, or lay out the framework for that equation. But since we're having this conversation now and we're looking at it, that's where we should be going late. that would be a whole calling itself just trying to start the math. Because of all the assets you have, all the people you have, all the sources that you're going, like, what does that look like for sweet law? Because there's, you're not going to have the same amount of staff. So anyway, it just depends on how much you you're interested in that. Whereas before, I think it was a no way in hell, am I doing that?
00:36:07 - mark sweet
And now it's a it's either that or so, or, you know, conclusion, the problem of the soccer model is, yeah, it's a it's a runway, but with a brick wall at the end of it.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Right.
00:36:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and everyone and a bunch of people get fired.
00:36:21 - mark sweet
Right. And who's going to work where the ship that's going down?
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. But so here's the thing, we're having this conversation sounding like that's a potential. We need to block our energy off from anything that's not even a real opportunity. So if you're really not even actually consider going down that path, then we need to stop talking about it and stop putting any energy to it. If you really are considering it, then you need to ask yourself, are you really willing to take the actions that have to happen, taking the people.
00:37:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
into account in order to make that happen and if so on what time frame are you talking about it two years from now five years from now 10 years from now because all of that makes a big difference but whatever conversation we're having needs to be real needs to be what we're actually working towards or we need to stop talking about it yeah who's what someone talks about like you know you can't have a B right you work the A it's like don't have a B because that it's it's a distraction the B becomes a distraction because you're considering this thing that you're not going to really do and you it pulls focus from the A so if the A is really selling the firm in and then yes put a time frame on it but with or without a time frame you can certainly define hey this is like what I was saying for me it's like this is what it needs to look like in order for me to sell it and maybe the time frame is like It's going to take me three years to even get to that point, right? But that point can be defined now. And if that point is like, hey, no one's going to want to buy this firm because I know my overhead is too high, well, then that needs to be factored in, like, how do I reduce that overhead in three to five years or whatever the timeframe is? then, I mean, in a way, you have sort of this B, it's not even a B, it's like a fall back. The fall back would be like, oh, if I do all these things to sell it, in theory, I could fall back to this Salka thing because it would just be there. But it's not being factored in at all. It's just sort of this known backstop that's there, but it's because I focused on the A version of this. No, that's my- So start firing people is what I'm hearing Tina say.
00:38:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is not what I said.
00:39:00 - mark sweet
But I heard a whisper, it's going to be there, like, no matter what I do, that's always going to be an option.
00:39:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It is.
00:39:07 - mark sweet
Yep. And realistically, it's not even a plan. It's like, it's a fallback. It also has more value to my firm that let's me get larger lines of credit or whatever I need to do for growth or whatever.
00:39:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. But it's growth in the context of selling, right? So then what, I mean, I don't know when Jacobi sells, right? what is the metric here?
00:39:35 - mark sweet
Is the metric straight?
00:39:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's profit margin in bottom line?
00:39:39 - mark sweet
No, because they're a brand. They're in the name.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am not. Well, yeah, that's true.
00:39:44 - mark sweet
That's not the problem. is significantly different than theirs. My value is the value of my cases and nothing else. Okay. I mean, yes, there's some value to my systems. Yes, your value to my people. Yes, there's somebody in my processes. what I do is very rip it.
00:40:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Replicatable. Okay.
00:40:05 - mark sweet
Right. there's nothing special. Like if Tina's law office tomorrow could pull from the same sources.
00:40:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you haven't the same I had, you could do the exact same thing I do. Right. Totally. The only difference would be that they don't know the numbers yet. Right. That's your advantage right now is that you've gone through and figured it all out. And now you're like, okay, these are the numbers, these are the targets. That's why the dude in Arizona failed. Right. We know that without even without knowing anything. He thought, right, money, money gets cases done. And it's, we know, because I say it all the time, it's idea money, excuse me. So you started the, what's interesting about your scenario is that it wasn't necessarily your idea. You changed the idea. The idea was Steve's idea and Steve's idea was wrong. He, he had ideas. money. And he's like, idea money, and then he sort of had the execution that was you, right? I'm going to execute it. But the idea was wrong. The idea was that he could spend money to get cases. And that wasn't true. So then he left you holding the bag, and then you change the idea. You were like, okay, I'm going to find vendors to get, I'm going to figure out how to get a series of vendors to get cases. So it was similar idea. But his sort of just relied on throwing a bunch of money at it. And it didn't work. And that's what the dude in Arizona did. His idea was, hey, if we throw a bunch of money at it, it turns into retainers. It turns into money. Of course, the idea being that every retainers equal, like God only knows what their math was. God only knows what Steve's math was. But then Steve's new idea was, I'm going to go buy marks, essentially, right? I'm going to go buy sweet loss. And that's what he started doing. And I'm sure his math is still bad.
00:41:53 - mark sweet
But that was a better idea than that. He's extremely different than mine. His math is, I can absorb a higher cost for gay speaking. because I get more out of them than anyone else.
00:42:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:42:03 - mark sweet
He's making a ton of money, so clearly, if not worse, I don't understand how necessarily.
00:42:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if you don't understand how, it doesn't really work.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
If you're sitting there questioning it, they don't reduce their fees ever for clients. I think they're outsourcing some item so they're payroll may be lower and just charting into the client.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, his math might not be all that great. By making this, he's getting $10 million settlement, or he doesn't refer it up.
00:42:40 - mark sweet
He keeps it lit again.
00:42:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are they even going have to get that?
00:42:44 - mark sweet
They are. They've got some good litigators there. Now, now they've got some. And again, they've got a brand. So they've got people, you know, being the name forever, you call in. So their costs should go down or whatever. time, but he's buying.
00:43:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. They're sort of hybrid model at this point. They're doing, they're sort of working multi models, basically.
00:43:09 - mark sweet
I mean, realistically looking at all of this, what I probably should do is save up enough money to spend a year worth advertising on billboards in Washington state. Steve's not in Washington. Yeah, they don't know who he is. Or Illinois or Missouri, like a state he's not going to.
00:43:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wonder what the alternative to billboards is, right? It's like, what's the bill? Is it like next door in Hulu? Like, what's what's the new billboard where like you're in everyone's face? Like, I see these commercials on Hulu. I've never seen a legal commercial on Hulu. But you're inundated with them now. And then it's like on next door. It's like, where what are the it's not Facebook.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, what are the
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equivalent of billboards.
00:44:01 - mark sweet
It's YouTube.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I ran a bunch of YouTube ads.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about TikTok?
00:44:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like, you can't, I don't know. mean, how do you, if a billboard is someone on their commute, it's like, how do you inter interject yourself?
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would test basically a billboard ad on TikTok. Because here could be, well, I, but I think it's cheaper on TikTok, but I don't know. But I would test and I do like this theory because I do think that social media is the better billboard or TV spot type ads, the streaming ads, because if you don't need it, so you don't have to have a long spot. It just has to be short and frequent. And so that somebody who has been in a wreck or recently gets in a wreck is going to have seen that, and the frequency is the most. or important thing, and a memorable number or access point website, whatever, but it's one of those things you don't need it unless you need it, and you're not looking for it unless you need it. So frequency and location, which is why billboards work, people pass them back and forth on their commutes. It is effectively the same thing, but it should be cheaper, and the exposure should be better, and the tracking is way better, which means the opportunity to optimize is better. And unless you've been seeing it, most of your competitors probably aren't doing it. Most of them are more old school, playing the old school game, dominating those spaces. I think that there's a lot to be looked into. This is not my area of expertise in terms of where to get it, but we could find those people and try it, set the budget aside, but I do think that that would be much better than billboards is TV spots and social media spots, but very short, very clear, billboard-esque so that you're not spending for a lot of time, but it's just frequency and location, location being digitally in their faces frequently. Personally.
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's like, what's the digital equivalent? If you think about a billboard, they're strictly like zip code base, right, and their routes, right, roads and zip codes, so it's like, hey, we're buying a billboard on this street in this zip code, right, and basically this lower income neighborhood is where they are, for the most part, right, or major, or in major, major thorough thoroughfarers, so it's like, what is the digital equivalent of that? I don't think you need to do that just like the bus. It's like buses, but that's what the if if you're gonna If you're gonna emulate that strategy You have to be like, okay I feel like this is the bus and or the banchan or the billboard like I think I'm just going through my head right now I see the whole day long here.
00:47:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see like who are you talking to the those neighborhoods?
00:47:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, that's the targeting the targeting is where Where is the who is it touching, right?
00:47:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like you drive by the billboard That's it and it's they picked that billboard for a reason so typically because it's Psychology behind it is Because you just made me think of something that we could discuss about this is first of all people of all Wealth ranges, I can't think of the word economic statuses Yeah, um, get in rex, but the bigger impact and the need to handle it strategically is with the impoverished people who like I can't afford to get health care I can't afford to get things fixed. Because a lot of times I mean you just make a call go to insurance people just like deal with it. I don't know. I don't know that that's true. That's an assumption, which I would be trying to get more data on if I'm trying to build the most optimized business. I would want to know what are the statistics of hiring a personal injury attorney across the income lines. What does that look like. Now, because here's the difference between billboard placement and doing it online is that placement has to work and it has to work for that demographic. And you don't want to waste eyeballs because of how much it costs whatever. Whereas when you're, when you're doing an online and casting a wider net, Mark can practice in all of these different states, and now he's, he's got less competition, because his competitors aren't in that same space, which is not the situation with the billboard ads. So understanding the frequency of hiring an attorney engaging an attorney, at least even exploring it with personal injury with an accident. And what is the competition presence in those spaces because those two are significant variables that billboards can't really change because they're physically located in one place. So, like, it isn't apples to apples, no matter how much we try to emulate it. I think it would be foolish to try to replicate it, I think taking the best practices, which is very The clear language, the visualization of it, the will get you help, you know, that type of thing, but things that we can do that billboards can't do a split test. We can track demographic engagement. You can't do that with billboards. you know, the angle that you're taking to me is a little bit like, I don't know. I think it's not tapping into the advantages that we have by doing it online.
00:50:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, when I've never seen someone do, and it's just my personal experience, it's like, what they do with billboards bus ads, whole thing, they're always hitting the vanity number. It's always the vanity number, right? So, what they're trying to slam home is this brand, this vanity number. So, you would emulate those aspects in an online ad, right? Whether it's a fixed image or it could be a video, right? But... it's really hammering home those two things so you would get a vanity number and then you dedicate it to your billboard scare quotes which is your online app and you would use and then you would rely on these these are how many people we've held from this how many millions of dollars we've gotten and settled or whatever no no the vanity number is like one eight eight five five five five five five five oh like they're all taken they all cost and seen amount of money but you have to have some that's yeah it might be easy to remember yeah you need a hooky something um like here it's i think the guy's number is all zeros or some maybe not that would be a terrible number we'll get you zero nine million um most different stories is 800 all sevens um Morgan and Morgan's got one that's the blades yeah yeah but that's what they do right so they're hammering home the brand and the number And it's literally just with the classic marketing of just repetition, right? They just keep repeating the same message over and over and over. They're just drilling it in people's heads. And then when the time comes, they're like, oh, I got in the car accident, I'm going to call 1-800-the-LAW, or whatever it is, and they do.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you use also a QR code?
00:52:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They have to scan it. So the way that it works traditionally is that they're remembering the hook. So it's like, you need the hook. Yeah. Or either in the name or in the number.
00:52:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, does it have to be? So first of all, there's options. There's so many different phone services with different prefixes where I think potentially you could get that if, and maybe there's a person whose job literally is just to go get you the best member memorable that stands out.
00:53:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or you have to figure out a hooky thing and then get the, you know, the decoded version of that, right? So you're as 1-800-COME 1-800-APPA and you're like, oh, it's available, but it won't be. It's like a domain name. It's like it's not going to be available. You have to pay a crap ton of money for it.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you just have to be a little bit creative in the way that you think of it, because like I can always find a domain that works really well that's available. It takes a lot of thinking about it and then you just have to brand that. But it's the thinking and it's always the thinking that does the winning because most people won't think that far and they won't think that hard, but that's the way you win this game.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to emulate that stuff, you have to come up with, that would be the works. And then, and get it. And then you'd copy that online and you could copy in all the ways that we just talked about, you could do it on the TikTok, right? Maybe you run these things in separate, distinct runs, right? But you have to run them for like, I mean, this is always trying to do the math in my head, right? So if you figure a billboard, someone goes by twice a day, right? So that's two impressions per person per day. So you'd be like, okay, I'm going to cap that aspect. I'm going to allow two impressions a day per person, because that's like a billboard. But same thing, they're going by maybe once or twice a day, any more than that's probably excessive. But then it's every day, because that's their commute. That's the way to the house. That's the store they stop every day when they're on their way home, whatever it is. So you would cap the impressions to two per day per person. And then what is that costing you? What does that cost on Hulu? What does that cost on TikTok? What does that cost on whatever? You could probably get kind of project that out. And it's like, okay, what you don't know is how long does that need to run until it turns into a phone call, a lead, or whatever, like that's the big question mark. then once you're committing to that, trying to figure that out, and then you would like a billboard, you would just leave it on in perpetuity. Hopefully you have tracking that can buy it back to TikTok or that becomes part of your intake. You get some of that, where'd you see us? But yeah, and it would likely be cheaper than a billboard, for sure.
00:55:41 - mark sweet
Well, people think billboards equal legitimacy.
00:55:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I think it's the repetition is what it's because, I mean, it's the advertising, it's the repetition that them seeing over and over and
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the imagery so it's it's in his favorite thing it's what does name space she loved it he's ready to hire him what are you talking about when you saw the sweet chains girl boards that are trashed fella oh boy almost doesn't matter what's on there as long as it's that frequent and it looks like authority and there are so the colors you know the navy blue um gold uh there are different colors that have psychology behind them um there's a whole color rule of psychology but it's also going to be so if it looks like something they've seen um there's black backgrounds basically and navy blue backgrounds the majority of them that's what they have they're used to seeing people in suits and ties big language they're to seeing a scale of justice, that imagery, a big phone number, you know. So, people that are in metro areas are used to seeing billboards like that. People in rural areas who still can make you just as much money and are not seeing your competition as much, they don't see those billboards. So, they see at best an ad in the paper and it's not very good, or they see a card that somebody's handed them because they live in a small town where there are no billboards. And you want, you're going to be targeting those people, that's probably actually the majority of them. So, you have to take that into account too. But even still, suits and ties, the scale of justice, navy, black, professional corporate type stuff makes people feel like, oh, that's an attorney. That's not Billy Joe down on the street who's brother is practicing law and says he can help me out, that kind of thing. So anyway, but it's starting somewhere. First of all, finding people that know those channels and can advertise well on them. Getting, I think we could probably find somebody to help us get a good vanity number without having to spend our time on it.
00:58:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm looking right now.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's horrible. then the other thing is to get a list of all the sources where you could get toll-free numbers. not 800, but a toll-free number and then find a few different phrases and basically we use chat2bt to give us a few different scenarios and then basically maybe take one of your assistants and systematically go through each of the toll-free providers with each of those phrases and see which ones possible. Eventually we get there. It's the great things, which is what we're aiming for doesn't come from little efforts and flukes. And you know, we just arrived there. It's strategy and it's systematically going from this step to this step to this step to this step. But and then, you know, there's innovation and disruption, which is where you're at right now, because your market is still primarily radio and billboards and maybe TV spots. There might be some people coming out of it, but we know enough to know that people buy from what they see on online ads and streaming ads and things like that. So it's not a huge risk. You can mitigate the risk by with the budget, but the likelihood and even probability that you could do better by putting some very strategic ads short, low level of exposure again with the math that that Dan was doing with the bill. boards, although I would probably want to double that if they see it two times a day. want to let them see it four times a day. If it's just a few cents per impression, I don't know.
01:00:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I would just try to near what's real, right?
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're like, okay, I'm trying to do define what's real though.
01:00:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like this is billboards. If you're commuting to work, well, you not pass it four times a day.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay, but I'm saying we should not be trying to duplicate billboards because you can't and it's so much better. So we're using billboard type strategy and ads, basically essential of it and knowing that those are the big competitors. And then the rest of the emulation would be from other successful ads that people are running on streaming services that are working for them.
01:00:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But we don't have any data on other.
01:00:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can find data. Anyway, I'm sure we can find data like if this is what we want to look at and it's worth really looking into and looking at it. Well, we can put some meat on this framework and and plot a course that that has some numbers behind it. So we're not just, you know, going blind, but we would have to decide that's what we're going to do. Who's going to go get the data and look at that, because again, going back to you trying to optimize everything that we have based on our resources. The fact that payroll is excessive and marketing is excessive. The faster one to try to correct could be marketing because payroll is going to be a whole, if you cut that back, there's a morale issue. And I'm not saying you don't cut that back, but, you know, replacing attorneys becomes difficult, and I don't know. You know, maybe that ends up working if you lose one attorney and you said, basically everybody can do from everywhere. It's just somebody else has to, you know, look, they have to pair up with somebody who is Able to work in in that state. That's a possibility.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So maybe you Yeah, that's that tricks on something. Thanks.
01:02:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I told you forget about this.
01:02:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? So I have a buddy that is barred in DC. He's now barred in California. Here in California, he had a job working for I forget the name of the place, but it was like in the legal department and the head of the legal department was a lawyer. So he worked under that lawyer and like did all the contract work, right? he knew all that stuff, but he was never I'm gonna say I don't know what to call it the lawyer of record or whatever, but he literally did all the work and then that person's name was attached to it. So it's like, what is that version? That guy can't command the same level that an actual barred lawyer can command. But it's like, is that, is that even possible?
01:03:15 - mark sweet
There's some, yeah, there's a huge difference. If you're in-house counsel in a corporate firm, it doesn't matter as much for your license. If they have to go to a corporate proceeding, he has to just pro hop in. So if you're doing too often, it's a problem. But if you're working in-house, it's not. Okay.
01:03:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Very different. There's no version of that in your world.
01:03:38 - mark sweet
That's what we're doing now. They're just doing it under my name.
01:03:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, what really? So these guys don't need to be lawyers? Theoretically.
01:03:48 - mark sweet
Technically. Diego can run a case from start to finish. As long as I'm signing off on it, it doesn't matter.
01:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that solves your payroll problem.
01:03:59 - mark sweet
No. It doesn't, because lawyers and case managers don't handle cases the same way, they're generally not as good, and they don't get as much money.
01:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I would argue that becomes a process issue, right? Could that be solved the process? So, I mean, in the grand scheme of things, would be like, don't know how would you test that theory, not in your office, right? Where people are like, wait a minute, he's gotten non-lawyers working on cases, what the hell is going on? That's a lot.
01:04:32 - mark sweet
mean, it's like Daniel Kim. Are you serious? He's attorney in his entire office. 99% of work that's getting done is being done by people who are not lawyers. Oh, so that is a thing. She failed law school and she just was borrowing an old man's lawyer.
01:04:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is real. I didn't No way.
01:04:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you could bring Kim Kardashian on the staff is what I'm hearing. This would do wonders for your marketing.
01:05:02 - mark sweet
Yes.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, okay in-house.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, let me go up in the lenses.
01:05:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's interesting. So you could have like, you, Mark, could take more cases in-house. know, everyone's on your name, but you could start taking more cases and then have like a sidekick that's not a lawyer, but you're like, this dude knows his or gal. They know their stuff, but they're not barred. So there's no threat of that person like going to another firm. So you could pay that more than like less than a Sam or whatever, more than the other, because you're like, I see that you're more than a case manager, right? So you went to law school, whatever, and then, and then teach them how to run a case the right way. And it's like, okay, and then, then that's it. Then they just know how to run the cases the right way, and then you just keep giving them cases. question is how are you-
01:06:00 - mark sweet
We found those people don't want to usually have some pretty large words, right? Otherwise, why are they not a lawyer? I still have all the liability here. So she's also got liability. I do have her supervising attorney, but her license on the line too.
01:06:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right.
01:06:18 - mark sweet
Yeah, totally. So there's a different level of responsibility versus Diego, who I get a bar complaint or I get super malpractice, it just goes on as another job.
01:06:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, maybe then that maybe that's where, so maybe that's where an incentive package actually works in your favor. I don't know that the incentive actually works in your favor with the lawyers, right?
01:06:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because they can't skate, but this person's like, hey, oh, yeah, it does what Samantha you can, you can tell.
01:06:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but so the grand scheme of things, there is a version of the world. There's a, there's a version of the where there are no attorneys on style. That's interesting. I didn't think that was really a thing.
01:07:05 - mark sweet
Oh, yeah. know there's a lot of those.
01:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had no idea.
01:07:08 - mark sweet
I just didn't see plausible. product is usually garbage, but yeah.
01:07:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is where my checklist argument is like, if the process is so dialed, you can mitigate that.
01:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.
01:13:44 - mark sweet
Okay, I'll talk about the script essentially does.
01:13:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I read it. I'll send you my notes because I'm like, to me, it's not a script. Okay. But parts of it are like it's in there.
01:13:57 - mark sweet
It's weird. The presentation, was like, well, it's not really a script. But, uh, but it's way there.
01:14:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's that first minute dude. Like I don't know if you guys listen to calls, but it's just getting whether they should stay on the phone right up right after the cell mutation. Like there just needs to be like one question, which I think it's sort of there. And then it's like, to me it was, I'm used to reading it like in a script mode. I don't know. Like from like being on sales teams in a certain way, that was like an overview of like the strategy sort of that. Like so, but whatever I read it, I would just change like that one part. And then because it's, if they get into the other parts, great. It's really just like, should they still be on the phone? That was the thing that I just kept running into like, dude, you should not be on this call. You're like wasting your time.
01:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that gets into call control training. That's all. Call flow. Yeah. All All All All All All All So we can keep working on that too. All right. We okay bad it.
01:15:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This 800 number stuff is for the birds.
01:15:17 - mark sweet
industry is clearly captured. We do have one half the one that we got produced this year. One eight hundred nine seven five two thousand. And not that difficult of a number to remember.
01:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not bad.
01:15:31 - mark sweet
That's a ring. You're paying numbers or whatever. Those are going for high six figure to seven figure.
01:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's just going to work. How much do you pay for that?
01:15:40 - mark sweet
We have it. I don't remember how much.
01:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we paid like a couple grand for it. Yeah. I think you can make that work. And again, it's repetition. So how many times does it get repeated? Like is it is it being said, it doesn't flash on the screen. It does a flash on the screen while it's being said. repeatedly those things stick in your head and so it's not just what you have but it's how you use it. That's workable.
01:16:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah and we can just mess around with it because it could it could be like you're sitting here like sometimes you just go boom there it is right so it's like you got this this one and then you might come up with one I'm like trying to do one around like oh I well the other thing is how adjacent is it to somebody else's so like if you ever typed a domain name wrong in or whatever like sweet lost sweet James like you can get into that oh yes it was strategic as you are if there's something closely adjacent to it that's a competitor then maybe that ends up actually creating more of an issue so something that's not related to a specific phrase but it's simple just an easy number to remember and you
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you make sure they remember it, then maybe that's actually better than potentially sending it to a competitor. Whereas if it's just a number off and it's, you know, Joe's burger shack, you're not worried about it because he's not going to take your business and they're going to keep trying to figure out who it was instead of go to your competitor.
01:17:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like 1-800-the-law 3, how about that Mark? sure that guy would love it if you did that.
01:17:30 - mark sweet
I'm sure I'm going to sued for that, yeah.
01:17:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like it's a totally different number, buddy. 3, 2, am I even saying? Yeah. The next number.
01:17:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I believe in...
01:17:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like the price is right strategy of phone numbers.
01:17:47 - mark sweet
I've got one dollar about it. I mean, we do, um, like, sweetlaw.com instead of just sweetlaw.com.
01:17:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
01:17:58 - mark sweet
No, it was like you just in case someone... misspell sweetlaw.com.
01:18:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, right.
01:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:18:04 - mark sweet
We also sweet.law. Or whatever that's for it.
01:18:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah.
01:18:14 - mark sweet
Okay. Sweet as you, IT portion is already taken.
01:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that what you have is, is easy enough. Like it really is. Think about all those ear rooms, those jingles, the friggin just repetition that stuff sticks in your head. It's, it's psychology. The human brain is not that complicated. So work with what we know works. Just it's the common seriously big text. It's flashing. Somebody's repeating that number over and over again. It gets in their head. They could be sleeping in the middle of the night and they're repeating that number and they don't know why. That's how the brain works.
01:18:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So,
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:19:01 - mark sweet
You're right. You're absolutely right.
01:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
doesn't matter how good or how about it. It's repetition.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:19:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
if it's a little hooky, it's got to have a little like roll off the tongue.
01:19:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it does because so you've got two sets of zeros, 800, 975, It very much falls in that and it's unique enough. So the repetition, it will get in there subconsciously. I'm telling you. And then if you make sure that you also make the correlation to this is an injury attorney, personal injury, a law firm, know, then it's it's stuck there. It gets into the seps and that's why I'm talking about more than two times a day, that kind of repetition. But whatever, we should be split testing it and we'll be able to test way more than radio ads, billboards or anything else. But we haven't even started this. This is going to be somewhat like I'm talking about a year long path going down here, trying to figure it out. and do it right but I think that we bleed a lot less money doing this. I think we have way more leverage doing this but the first thing we have to do is stop being afraid of what's got to be this it's got to be that it just tapping into human psychology that's what makes marketing great doing it getting data real data not assumed data because somebody else is doing it getting real data and then adjusting our approach based on our real data that's what we should be doing.
01:20:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how to think is like this is also like a 1980 strategy right this is based off of a phone number the letters on the phone like why would you even do that what is what is the new version of that what is the future version of that is it text settlement quote to 965 well that's the other thing I was thinking about is how do we engage a chatbot into these types of things.
01:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So that because these people was streaming ads, whatever, do they want, you know, an instant answer? Do they want to have to dial one number? Do they want to have to remember it? Can they remember at Sweet Law now or something like that, where we're somehow the Google search and it gets into a chatbot? I don't know, like, hit us up on Messenger here. And maybe that was on a Facebook ad, hit us up on Instagram messages. And it's on an Instagram map. It, like, TikTok messages, TikTok ads, kublu message, I don't know, maybe it's a phone number, whatever. But that, again, is all the nuance.
01:21:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But first we have to get a framework to get started as a QR code. For sure.
01:21:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the thing is that here's the two things. So if they're streaming on their TV and they have a QR code on the TV, then you get it with your phone. If they're streaming on their phone and you have a QR code, then you have an issue because they can't scan it with the device. They're watching it, but can it be a clickable QR code with Hulu ads? I don't know, but that's a potential and if that's not available now, I guarantee you it will be down the road very soon because they want advertisers to stay with them and the more engagement they can create for their advertisers, the more money the advertisers will spend, so that's just down the road. So if we're planning for that, if we're positioned to be able to take advantage of those things because we're already on that path, all the more better for us. But either way, being where the people are, that's the whole point of white billboards work. So that is what we should be doing by online.
01:22:49 - mark sweet
Still think the boards still work, we should still be there.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying they don't work, but you want an optimized leverage business and there's competition and dollars matter. So definitely. fine work. Does it get you clients? Yes. Does it get you in the profit margins you want to be? Bet you it doesn't.
01:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's really the time. The time is a totally unknown variable. Like, does it take a year? Does it take two years? Like, how long does it take? And how much the only way to plan that is?
01:23:21 - mark sweet
Yeah. It's going to take at least a year.
01:23:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:23:25 - mark sweet
So you got to stick this in for at least to get it.
01:23:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So but here's the thing Mark. Do you want to work? Do you want something that works? Or do you want something that works at maximum capacity? Optimal leveraged? I thought that was what we were working on.
01:23:44 - mark sweet
I'm interested though in how we build a brand that has more value to getting those. And unfortunately, purely digital does not carry the same way.
01:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that you're making assumptions based off of the world up until this point when the world is something changing and is almost new every year at this point.
01:24:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and the other thing is that brand is, is free of analog or digital brand become brand is branded exists outside those things. And then they translate that brand into an online search, right? So are they brand is losing its power? Brand. But you can brand through both and then the brand is established. So the question is you can build brand through an oppression offline or online. So it's like you get to the same destination of brand.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think brands now is as powerful as your reviews are because that's what people are relying on. Back in the day, it was all word of mouth. We knew what we heard about. And what we heard about was from our friends, whatever, and so that was the power. our branding. But now, everyone, not everyone, but a lot of people go to review sites. So you've already got that game locked down. If you do that, and also are in the location where they are, when they need it, I think that they, I don't know, that we've got to get some research to find out the power of branding. But everything that I've been watching for at least the last five years is suggesting that branding is much less important these days. Unless you're looking at the brand being their reputation online and their reviews.
01:25:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, deep in the vanity shortcuts. Like, how do you get one of these? I don't think I've ever seen a Or he's one of these either.
01:26:01 - mark sweet
Uh, Morgan and Morgan uses pound law.
01:26:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go.
01:26:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what about pound, sweet love or sweet justice?
01:26:11 - mark sweet
love that one. People don't know how to spell on their phones very well. OK. more they try to spell a word, the more likely they are to screw it up because people just keep on them. Numbers now, they don't really, you know, see letters. That's much.
01:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, this is this would be text text my quote to 0, 0, 0, 0.
01:26:38 - mark sweet
Right.
01:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have to spell anything. They're spelling my quote in the SMS message and then the destination is 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, it all is.
01:26:50 - mark sweet
Yeah.

Until I'm also going to look at the QR codes. This is not going to be far away where they're on a device. device or QR code where you can click that and all of that will be coded into the link that all they have to do is tap it and it opens up the text message or an app with a message that drafts it and all they have to do is click send and it's going with the right word and to the right number or address.

That's so and that's leverage that's what I'm talking about every friction point that you can remove like you guys are talking about these different games you know branding and it you don't you don't have to win the branding game you don't have to win the billboard game what you need is a certain amount of cases and at a certain value above and beyond what you're at without increasing your payroll costs. That's all you need. We're overcomplicating it but trying to worry about what the competitors are doing. Leverage the technology. That's available to us now. Keep your eyes on your own path, because we have enough data to know that we can do better if we apply it and stop thinking about everybody else.

> 00:00:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey lady. How are you? Good. How is that onesie?
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Comfy, but I just started my period and I'm cramping and it hurts. And that is definitely what messed up my sleep. But did you know I did not know it messed up my sleep so bad until I started cracking my cycle?
00:00:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, interesting.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the nights that you have a sleep. Oh my gosh, like the worst. And I never really made that correlation. Like I know what my cycle is. I almost always have a 28 day cycle, although in perimenopause, I've gone like four months, a few times without it. But because I take my hormones regularly, it kind of regulated it again.
00:00:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the two days right before, I'm like, cannot sleep at all.
00:00:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then yesterday,
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like my I had the raging migraine all day long and my sugar was low no matter what I ate I even ate pizza and cookie dough oh and so that was really enjoyable but then like I woke up in the middle of the night and I could feel it dropping so then I went to eat more of it but I should not have done that because I felt like garbage anyway and then my sugar totally spiked on me I'm like you know make up your mind oh my god that's funny so then I went to sleep and my daughter went to seminary because we were so we were up early but like she can manage either seminary or school and can't seem to get both done because honestly it's a lot hmm yeah and she's trying to figure out herself and I'm in the place where I was just like oh and my other daughter she's in beauty school and she was not prepared for the fact that they were chemical peels on the faces yesterday, and microdermabrasion on the back. So her body went through it. And I'm just like, okay. And then I got asked out by this crusty old nasty man today, he texted. But like he tried ask me out a few years ago, I'm pretty sure he's old enough to be my dad.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm talking just crusty.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people's faces are cool. Okay, that was actually called gag reflex just now. I was not being sorry, dramatic. I just ate. And the thought of it is making me really, truly nervous. yeah, so he thought he would invite me to a church singles dinner. And I'm just like, I normally want to watch my mouth. But today I want to tell everybody to off.
00:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got you. I am very excited and happy to talk to you again.
00:02:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, that's funny. God. what an experience for your holy cow. It's Interesting though that you're tracking your sleep cycles and you found it on the day of your period because it's like this morning I started watching YouTube video from a new person. I'm gonna start following She was on a hay house meditation because I couldn't sleep last night. So I started listening to it and she wrote the Book she's a doctor and but she writes about menopause as well and intermittent fasting and she's got a book She just released called Fast like a girl or something like and and then another one's about menopause for woman but anyway, the thing that she said was interesting is She she has a good YouTube video is about Phases you're in whether it's perimenopause whether it's menopause or post-menopause and the kind of Fasting or diet structure. That's good to follow. I found interesting. Anyways, I'm a little If you ever heard of her, I'll send you the link if you're interested. Yeah, my probably followers are already. I've learned so much. Okay, let me see. I'll send it to my friend, I'm not Amanda. I'm Amanda Chavon. My friend Chavon. My man in a group text. me just get this. There you go. Hold on. It's Dr. Mindy Hells. Yes. Oh, you know where? Okay. Okay, got it. And then it's so funny because when I was googling her, I'm like, I can't believe people make a business model on this because how many people Google her because she's big now. On Etsy, there are a ton of for like $2.99 or maybe $5.10, $18.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All of these planners for fasting using Indeed Peltz's protocol. Yeah, I mean, this is the thing because somebody was posting. Like, are we really in a recession? Like, is there really money problems? And I said. But here's the issue, there's plenty of money out there to be had by people who are creative and willing to be of service and to fill a need. But the other thing is that people who are doing that are also taking care of the people who don't know how to do that, who don't emotionally have it in them, who don't have resources or the capability for some reason, totally sorry I'm just like tangent, but like the gas prices, the groceries, the rent, all these other things, those things truly have increased 33 to 50% or more. Some of it has been like 400% looking at the grocery prices, it's closer to 400%. So people that are any kind of connected to their community are definitely filling the pain at the end. economy. But, you know, the perspective is, is that this, there is, did you ever see the movie robots with Will, Will Smith? No, yeah, I was Will Smith and that Robin Williams was in it.
00:06:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'm sure I've seen it. Let me see, there's maybe Will Smith was the eye robot. Yeah, Okay, the cartoon one.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you ever see it?
00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe not. Um, Robin Williams, it's a great cast. Jennifer Coolidge, Mel Brooks, William McGregor. It's amazing. Um, but, um, it was about this, uh, you know, awkward robot who didn't fit in, but he made his way in the world and he was a fan of this inventor who ended up being, you know, a jerk. But his thing was always see a need, feel a need. And that's how you make a arc and that's how you change the world and anyway so yes we really and truly are in a recession and but the reason people can't figure it out is because there is tons of money still being spent in a market but the the money has shifted but yeah oh you don't need all of it you just need enough and these people are like there's another quote that i love is um don't get in the way away if you think something's impossible get out of the way of people who are doing it or something like that love that yeah anyway so and all of this is in perfect alignment with what you're doing because i'll say we are doing yeah um because youtube is a way for everybody to get a piece of it and the whole you know what i came across and shared with you last week is that less than two percent or around two percent of youtube on YouTubers are actual content creators, that's wild.
00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, anyway, well, no, and it was cool on the the teaching, like everyone loved it, and I'm doing a repeat of it on tomorrow as well. Oh, I should actually send an email out to remind people. Um, but, you know, it's just, it's so interesting that, um, people are looking for alternative things right now too, at the same time. Like, I don't know, maybe you do, but I hear from my other friends that people who used to sell a ton of switching tangent a little bit, who used to sell a lot of money on high ticket coaching, now trying to figure out what to do, right, because the sales aren't coming in. so now obviously they're looking at AC phones too, but, um, I think the YouTube thing, uh, is a no risk solution because it's free. Did I tell you? So my sister didn't even know that it was free to post a video on YouTube and start a channel.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:09:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, Oh, my God, Julia, I need to get you on a Zoom call and record you. And I post the video up because you're asking questions I never even thought people would have. I just assumed people, you know, so yeah, she's like, Oh, wow, that actually really is cool to launch a business that way, right? one of the guys on the YouTube course on Saturday, yeah, I also said that, um, yeah, we were always taught to monetize it by getting the subscribers and the views and then ads, but I love segueing to digital offers. So so and that's before I didn't tell anyone about the name change that we're going to do. I kept it to keep congruent with what they bought. I kept it as YouTube fast track naming convention, you know, I think I changed the slide deck to just say YouTube profits so that we didn't have to do too much re tooling later. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have my heating pad on too, just so you know Buffalo Plaid onesie so you can visualize this. I got up and took my daughter to oh my gosh I keep forgetting I got to meet with my attorney clients at one o'clock too. They're awesome I'm just like want to be in bed today not really but like physically. I was like that yesterday I actually from one o'clock on I just stopped working I but mine was different I had that hot chocolate hangover oh yeah yeah I finally feel amazed today but I'm getting back into intermittent fasting and I do feel better today like it's two o'clock I have energy so that's a good good thing yeah let's see Within two weeks, you just highlight all this. Here's the entire recording, um, but this is not downloadable, right?
00:11:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it is actually.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me go there so I can download it. don't want to. Do you happen to have to zoom have a transcript for you? Because that would be what's most helpful to me.
00:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, what I can do is upload it to unlisted YouTube channel and it produces the transcript.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. Would you please because I want to, um, go through and make the first version of an outline that you can go through. Oh, yeah, I covered all this. I bet you'll probably even surprise yourself by how maybe not because I know you studied any prepared everything. But with the questions that people asked you. Yeah. then everything that you covered. And then what we could do is look at did and um oh I don't know how good my brain is going to do right now sorry I was thinking about using Maui to create some you know graphically pleasing things that you're not spending time doing that and I could pay for that and and work with him and follow some instructions I was thinking um that you know lots of people make the make youtube products use youtube colors or they use their branding colors and I think a blend of because we know that blue is trust a deep dark a deep dark blue that goes good with the youtube red and um nice oh I like that I do let me see if I can find a hex color yeah the reason I chose the reds and the sales page because I remember watching another guy I don't know know is no heard of his name's Korosh I forget his last name he's kind of like a uh a secret allen sultanic like he's behind the scenes of a lot
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
low ticket funnels as well. And I'm in his community because I paid $27 for his low ticket offer. He was reviewing someone's offer about YouTube. And I remember he gave the guy , he said, okay, you got to, the copy's not bad, but you know, you have to have red in here because this is YouTube course you're selling and people are familiar with YouTube and use the red. So that's where I got that little tip because normally I don't use red in my sales pages.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So dark blue gradient. I see that's a little darker than I want.
00:13:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we're going to be like Superman colors than I was thinking. Oh yeah, I love that. Me too. I actually have a Superman t-shirt.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So Marvel or DC? I'm a Superman's DC, but are you more Marvel or DC?
00:13:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know the difference.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just like the movies. What? Yeah, I assume all of those are Marvel, but Superman is easy Batman and DC Now, you know nerdy I am That's cool.
00:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I watched really cool I think what I mean about a TED talk how Marvel licensed a lot of these brands and it was yeah, it was a cool business kind of TED talk.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure so I think something not quite as dark as this, but I was hoping that if I picked one it would give me more Ooh like this something like that Um, so with the youtube red like that will just compliment really well.
00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see You know, you literally could just grab the hexacode from the Superman logo I don't know you wanted to go that brighter blue.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't I well So I think about I strain when I okay And certain colors are easier on the eyes.
00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, okay. Okay.
00:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, anyway, but I think something, something like that, and it almost feels kind of Superman esque. And you could put, let's if there's like a YouTube logo here, design elements.
00:15:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And obviously, obviously a yellow will go with a nice fat too.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Let's see. Elements back. I mean, they just look good together, that looks powerful to me.
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
looks really good, actually. I like that's pretty cool. That's got a nice and well, there's darker versions.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I wonder what the darker version What's funny is check out, I'm going to put it in the zoom chat. I just googled like color combinations for red and blue. And this particular pin on Pinterest is kind of identical to the colors you got on there just for just for yachts. Go ahead and click that link in the zoom chat.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious, Maria. Yes. Are we not in sync? I love that. I love that. Oh, I like this. The colors are not quite the same, so we can edit to match.
00:16:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I'm just going to grab my tea.
00:16:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My tea.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My green tea. tea. Mm, text. OK. Alrighty. I don't know. I am not a designer, but just just a little like idea. Something to start with. He's really great at stuff, but I like hobby. beginning of like let's use these kinds of colors um yeah i don't know but i mean i think it looks sharp i mean i will look that and go you or anything like that yeah no no i i love it i think it looks fantastic yeah yeah um just for the heck of do you want me to find that youtube sales page or that other guy for sure okay let me see let's we can use this as um just kind of gathering resources and then making a gangpline because you still have one call on deck for gaining information and then um but i would love to mass assimilate everything and if we're um you know we we weren't kind of opposite schedules but we don't need to be in meetings to be productive our rocks or chats are really productive i do screen captures i'm sure you do screen captures so like if we want to be aggressive about setting a deadline and putting something together like you can see i'm i'm willing to like we can create things together i can put things into membership areas like we can really roll this out quickly.
00:19:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I figured it'd be like go high level membership area because I know sistine.io has membership area but for like scaling it.
00:19:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and um worst key scenario like one of them worst case scenario but like damn um he would be helpful especially if you threw him a bum by not charging him so much or something. Yeah sure yeah but like he's got his team is like really good at it and fast and they know lots of things they could help us with the chat bot um so there's a lot that we could do and however that works out like uh I could help you with whatever you're doing with him like I don't want to uneven the burden but in terms of like getting something done quickly, efficiently, expertly. Yeah we've got some some resources to go to. My girl has um been kind of quiet. she's a young mom with young kids and trying to figure out babysitting stuff lately.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, anyway, so I think that that could be a good place to start and build a home kind of quickly. I say easily because we've got people and if people need to be paid, I'm willing to put money out to pay for it. However, you know what I mean? Like I am in whatever this takes because I know that you're going to bring amazing content.
00:20:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's hurting. Well, yeah, and what it'll be cool is like, here's what the Nirvana that I'm looking forward to. was going to say it because I know this is what you also will be good at. I'm sure and want to be in control of is like just all of the keeping to the plan, like the big rocks and
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and future plan and having like financial meetings like you'll go okay like whether you hire a VA or someone to actually monitor you know the the money's coming in and money's going out for this and then um just I just think that would be really cool to have like CFO dashboard type meetings once a week or something or maybe it's in our like yeah so so yeah uh shoots so we can start I always start rudimentary we'll call it um you know we'll just do that and so we can track um so expense description I'm um source paid Um, so like if it's Tina's account or Maria's account, whatever, yeah, then revenue. Um, we'll, we'll track, um, resource, date, received, um, um, paid to Maria, yeah, I'm out, paid to Tina, out, we'll just, this is rudimentary too.
00:22:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't know, I get it, yeah.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, and then oh, actually we'll go paid to Maria. Cause I have no idea how we're going to do it and organize, but I think that you were talking about like doing it US for reasons and so, yeah, you know, like because so many things are changing like now, even when I use, um, Upwork, they want to,
00:23:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and Fiverr. They want to charge me GST. So if I hire someone for like 10 bucks to do an e-book cover, then all of sudden they're charging 13% on it. So when I pay the person their 10 bucks, I'm also paying the extra $1.30. And that'll add up over time, which is ridiculous because me, I don't know how they're doing it because it's against tax law because the only time you pay GST is if the service provider lives in Canada as well. So if someone lives in Pakistan, I'm still paying this goods and services tax and harmonized tax. It's like, whoa, so yeah, we would lose out so much if we had to do through my Canadian company, all the members, like all the revenues in, all the expenses. I'd rather have your US entity have all the revenues in expenses and all that jazz.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, we will, we will, we can plan on that and then figure out how to, you know, because we're not great, but that definitely sounds like we're probably better than, than doing it that way. So, um, Yeah, okay, so we will, so let me share this with you.-hmm. Sure. Yeah. Um, what, it's self-explanatory. Sure, anyway. You know, nobody can't, okay. Um, oh, what was the YouTube sales page?
00:24:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, uh, yeah, I just set that to you in the Zoom chat.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, there it is.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was a nice time. It was a nice say it. Oh.
00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Now his givers are high because he's a YouTube agency as well. That created a little ticket. So all of those testimonials are his one-on-one agency client. So I thought that was a little not cool, but it is what it is, I guess.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah. So what is it about this that you do like and that you want to model?
00:24:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what, oh, no, no, no, nothing to model off. It was just, it was just, that was the funnel. The guy was critiquing because he had an old. for colors. And then and Kurosh was like, okay, you're selling YouTube and you got to make these colors red and white and black.
00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, got you.
00:25:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's all. That was just the point. Like, I have no idea how well it converts. I'm sure it's good. But obviously he's got a good back end because he does like high ticket AMC YouTube work for people. So yeah.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I mean, it's not much of a product. He's just giving out 100 done for your video. He's actually bought it. It's just a freaking like, of course, he has some videos about it, which is good. But it literally is just like beginnings, like the hooks for a video. It's ridiculous.
00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder what kind of YouTube PLR we could get to value stack.
00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I already bought one on Etsy. And if you pull in that Canva template that I gave to resell rights, the YouTube ultimate, the ultimate YouTube planner. And it was Pretty decent, actually.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, what kind of did you give me?
00:26:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, I think I also sent you like in that email that I gave you a copy of. There's a link to the slide deck. Actually, I'm sorry.
00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't like give you the Canva template on Friday and it's in the Trello board Friday night.
00:26:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, if you just click the Google Drive link, I can show you where the links are to the presentation as well, whichever is easiest.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, let me get two profits for you and change this.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know if I put it in that board, so I think I might put it in the list of YouTube profits under HQ, Business HQ, I think.
00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, because that's where we decided we were going to do things. Yeah, so, um, there you go, draft presentations. Yeah. Yeah, I have bad the windows that you probably can't see that are in the way I got to move. Oh, OK. Out of the way in the chat, uh, sorry. Where am I going?
00:26:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Under YouTube profits for offer. Let's do the second one draft presentation. Oh, okay. I moved it up higher.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could see it higher Dang it open. I just want to open you.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. There you go. Okay, cool Oh, look at this Yes Well, maybe I can See that way and if you go to page 12 Oh, I quoted you on the on the video on page 10 Uh, and then when I'm talking I say and this was from my friend Tina Marie that said this so good Do you want to live on youtube or do you want to live? I mean there now everything else I've made the don't be temple bundle research and google worship But the ultimate youtube planner camera template that's from master resale rights. It's actually pretty darn good I just changed the the the beginning of it um Yeah I just changed the cover page see how it's got pictured me there Gleeing against the graffiti wall.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes Oh, I see.
00:28:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. I mean, it's pretty decent.
00:28:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And we could just change the branding like the style and the layout or did you already do that?
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, all I did is change the cover to put a picture of me in the background. I didn't really didn't teach by it. I said, look, if you're the type of person that needs a planner, here's this because the Google Google sheet is really the planner and the implementation thing, you know?
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Just the tiniest bit of like making everything white instead of cream and like maybe changing the font and apply all so that it looks slightly different. I agree. it doesn't look at an immediate man thing.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I literally downloaded it Friday at 11 p.m.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with before this. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not saying you should have done it already. I was just saying we do this and I'd be happy to do it and all that. And you did so much.
00:28:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, I was up to a minute on Friday preparing it.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are, you our rock star workhorse. It's so good.
00:29:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The real man is for you to be making the money and like it not be for your clients or a husband or whatever. feel good that way and then Tina and honestly made me think because there's two other people that remember there was a few people pipeline. There's two other people still pretty serious about wanting to hire me and it makes me think like just to stick with this and this only you know and not even entertain. I'm just telling them hey look I'm fully booked till January February something. don't know but just because listen this pulled in I envisioned 30 sales I said 30 spots do you know that because remember when I talked there was 20 spots like 2k I think at five minutes to 12 before it closed and redirected to hey it's closed URL the 30th sale came in and I was and I was visioning 30 spots.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, girl, that manifestor in you.
00:30:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Yeah. So I thought that was cool. Now I reopened it just today to close to work since I'm teaching again live tomorrow. So I'm just going to send a quick email to my list in case any stragglers because I've had a few messages. Hey, can I still get in? But yeah, anyways, just some thoughts about that.
00:30:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You've got the one guy at $5,000 every month and you said that covers your lights on costs, right?
00:30:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It really does. Like I do pay Sally some money out of it. Like I paid her 500 a few days ago to work on like the crap stuff that I like to do, like the formatting inside the funnel and his go-high level account and like putting together some.
00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, go ahead. All right. Before I lose my train of thought because my pain, I lose my focus or easy. Yeah. One second. almost did it. Oh, so in terms of like now, this wouldn't be as much money. But first of all, right now, like your needs. are close to met, especially with the extra little bit of income, but would it not be more joyful for you even if you just did another let's say four more live webinars through the end of the year and sold that or we just like hustled out and knocked this out and made another two, five to 10k, who knows? the potential for 10k is pretty easy if we really work quick and but I think this would be so much more joyful. I don't to settle for anybody else's stuff. I think that this is a prime time for launching a product like this.
00:31:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what did you sell up for? Oh, just I just said it's 97. It's normally two 97 early bird price. And I said, Hey, this also probably become a $1,000 course because I'm adding to right?
00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think what if you kept selling it at 97 the end of the year. And on January, let's say fifth, right? So that people have time to get through the holidays and make a last minute decision. It's 97. But at that point, it goes to 147. And we don't tell them, we just tell them the price is increasing. Period. End of story, never to be this low again. And we can let it just, you know, microscopically kind of increase to 147. But if you already got that many sales at 97, and it was kind of by the seat of your pants, granted, your pants are brilliant marketer pants.
00:32:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
they're not average pants, right?
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but the sales page is . going to admit that.
00:32:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The delivery and the content is amazing. Like that's where I spent all my time. there's probably 12 hours and just two hours of And I both know the ugly converts and words probably were not should be on the page. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I did have cell the screenshot, some of the people's zoom comments and she stuck it on the sales page, this more, a few of them.
00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, not average pants, that's a long thing.
00:33:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I understand, yeah. And I did tell them that I'll be coming to them within seven days with a very small survey for their feedback, make this course even better, but also in little testimonial contests where they can win a $500 reward. So someone will win like a one hour with me. But I definitely want real testimonials, not just in a zoom comment, but like someone either emails me or leaves a comment on Facebook, on my post, or they send in a video testimonial.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here is a, obviously I've had no time to think this through, but what if, and I don't know how your, your viewer listed, but you're getting, you're getting, how many of the people that came to it, came through you too?
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know? Isn't that interesting? Yeah, you know, I tried do a little poll. I'm not like I did an official poll who has a YouTube channel who doesn't and 80 percent of people have a YouTube channel who came um but um I would say uh probably out of the 30 people I would say 10 I was really surprised that they came from YouTube first joined school I will say that so then the school could be at five bucks a month uh and then school and I didn't really again I would say a one out of ten effort um I just posted a couple of posts to join the YouTube class um and that's really it so so I think even more could have came from it so that might be an interesting funnel YouTube videos to a school low low price you know five bucks a month thing to that your other digital offer
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that could be something interesting, play it at work as well.
00:35:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which, when you think about it, is what I think Hermosi is really teaching on school.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could not care less about that guy, so I never even think about it. Oh, I know, I know, know. Funnel idea. And that might be wrong because maybe the better funnel idea is we stick with what we're talking about. We send them to a low ticket offer or a webinar. No, because it's already worked. Yeah, it does. Thank you. you. You, you, you, in less than two weeks of having this idea specifically, and this offer, as far as I know, you've only had this particular offer for teaching YouTube profits that you've been talking about for just two weeks. And that's correct.
00:35:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two weeks. That's correct.
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you, you, for sure, there was Facebook traffic and there was YouTube traffic. And I think you need to banish the low ticket in terms of like less than $97. I don't think we have to go there. I think we want to go there later to spend it, but right now. how if we want to maximize eyeballs and profitability and also energy and the fact that you got 30 people to say yes at 97 in two weeks they have to warm up to the idea that's pretty powerful those are powerful signals so let's mimic what you already did so it's YouTube and Facebook to school to sales page to live webinar or ESL or other webinar drop it and turn into that what what
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, what what what this for yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, we we could really capture the whole craziness about school right now. Um, know, there's so many people that are intrigued about school because of Alex Hermosi and I have to say it was easy.
00:37:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like even getting stuff up on system IO, there's still always pain in the butt, whereas I have to say for a lot of people delivering knowledge and coaching on school is probably one of the simplest software plays ever.
00:37:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Why instead of getting more complicated right now, why don't we just do the YouTube class and course on school?
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you can unlock that like that can be its own paid thing. Hold on, let's go into school. Yep. Yeah, right now I a Black Friday toolkit that is locked.
00:38:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, everybody's already there.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I should because you put me as a admin.
00:38:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I did. You are an admin in mine. What if I change it to business accelerator? But I kept the make money with Maria online there for now because what you and I need to talk about is if we're going to probably start a new YouTube channel around this new brand of ours, I could record the setting up of that channel as part of the training material too.
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, why can't I? I should see it and make money online with Maria's doll. Yeah, okay, so classroom. Yeah, so the YouTube thing could be in here or we could create a whole new one for an extra $100 a month when that's one of the customers out of 30 you already sold. So like we can make that investment and it be worthwhile and and so and they'll see it and you can link to it Here if we have any other courses we can link to that. Why don't we just stick with school my Sorry, man my my brain just goes in and out when I get a rush of pain and heat Okay Got to catch my breath for a second Um So I like speed of implementation and I like minimum viability for new products. Yeah long term I would like to build out a robust system that does really good Nurturing and that's what I think high level is great for. Yeah, I have to take time here. I'm sorry. Hold on My body is going through it. Okay, um, do you just can come and just resurrect me right now.
00:39:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll be okay with that Okay
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, with that, Jeez. Come on. So, yeah, so minimal invincibility, it is an extra expense, it's, I mean, a go-high level is $300 a month anyway at an agency level. you know, we could put that at, like, 2, 2025, where, okay, now we've got a community, now we've got people, and we could just start, instead of migrating people over, we can offer them, say, hey, we're migrating, but basically, live in both areas until everybody dies off here, or we moved over and can incentivize them to move over, because you get lost when you try to move people to new building, right? already got subscriptions going, and that's not good. Yeah. So, anyway, we could do that, but in the meantime, this allows us to teach them quickly into fulfill what's been sold and to nurture them, and then high level would be part of the larger master Sound which is first of all kind of automating the teaching experience with the follow-up Hey, did you check out this you know module one? I noticed you didn't check it out. Here's what you should what you can do for blah blah blah which takes a lot of time to write that kind of Engagement nurturing sequence, but we'll get more people to consume the content More people to get results and really help us to make a bigger impact which also then creates more brand awareness We'll sort of mouth all that but in addition to it then we can start working on expanding the You know the marketing and the business growth and upgrading right so higher value higher price and But also now where you can you will have money that we will have earned from here like like let's set a goal hold on so if we're talking about the beginning of q2 in 2025 that we've made 80,000 through this by then. So 40,000 for you, 40,000 for me, but let's say we set aside 10,000 for each. So maybe like we set aside 20% for business growth includes marketing systems teams forever. And then we just put that in a kitty. And it's, it's, you know, but high visibility, you see it, I see it, we both can see it. you know, you know, we know exactly where the money is at, at all times. And we have weekly updates on finances and total transparency. And not because either of us have any concern, but because that's just a practice. don't allow apathy, we don't allow any kind of temptation or anything to create that. I'm not worried about it, but the thing this, as soon as you stop worrying about stuff like that, you know, the adversary is good at what he does.
00:42:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he can, he can twist people.
00:42:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we just want to make sure that we avoid that opportunity and have total transparency on a weekly basis. Anyway, so you set aside. 8%. I think there's, for sure, I think we could do $80,000 by then. But even if we did half of that by then and have the whatever other income coming in and manage the resource as well, move it to high level, launch the bigger thing. We've got a following, we've got people who should automatically upgrade, even if it's 10% and even if it's 10% of let's say like 300 people and not, I think that that's conservative. Based off of the 30 you got into weeks.
00:43:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, let's just kind of write it down as like a. Let's see. So, would we start from scratch, a new school community, or what do you think? I think you do because then you get it branded. And you can really use branding power, give it a very specific name so that people who are curious. Let's just about and then they watch the sale. video that can be right there on that page.
00:44:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And and and I think it's good too, because then we can keep it specific to the like people search now in school for stuff. And obviously, if they searched anything to do with YouTube, they wouldn't find me.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one guy did say he's sorry. I said right.
00:44:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. But one guy for the make money from me online, he did search digital offers, and that's how he found me. That's how he joined. So I thought that was cool to hear as well.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So my brain is going by myself. I'm just going to this is going to be all over place. Q two.
00:44:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Level. Whoa. Okay. Now. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh, yeah. That's how this works. So let's see. Road map. Whatever. It's different than that, but we'll see that. So Q4, new school group dedicated to 97 a month, YouTube, of course, price, goes back in January. What's the what's the first Monday after the first week of January? January 6th, or was I at trouble? This is it? January 6th, 2025 and we'll One, four, seven. Okay. Huge. Huge.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And.
00:47:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, this is kind of capturing what we were talking about. So, we're talking EK by March, 20,% in growth accounts for those units. So, that's it. etc. Okay, so that captures what we're doing. So now, in the meantime, what what we need is to figure out what can we do and like what are you willing to do? What do you want to do? don't know how exhausting was to do that that life call. Do you want to do another one and do it like in two weeks from now so you have some more time to build it up and we just like build out a marketing campaign and devote some money to those, whether it be YouTube ads or just...
00:48:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think we could because I still think 97 is a good price point to cool traffic. Yeah, and we just have to... Yeah, I mean, we'd have more testimonials too on sales patient. Pretty powerful. And literally, we have no upsells or downsells or order bumps so can imagine how much money... We could make. Um, yeah, I'm game for that.
00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's plan that out too. Okay, so, um, um, um, plan. We'll let be another live webinar in two weeks. So, um, so do you want to do it two weeks from last Saturday?
00:49:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, we can do that.
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we'll just check in this enough time. Oh, I mean, you did that crazy fast.
00:49:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, no, teaching is not a problem. It's more the ads for in the sales page. Because my thought processes, do we keep it in Sistine.io or do we move that to your high level account?
00:49:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so what I think we do is keep the same thing while we're building out the back end and delivering the content, sell it the same way you sold it. So, we're not over complicating anything while putting out the long term strategy, but that allows us to just. been to making money now and kind of just refining the process.
00:50:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Okay.
00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, so that was, that would be November 16th. And man, I'm kidding. Yeah.
00:50:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry, my brain just checks out. No, no, no. Um, and we can talk more about tomorrow because when I do paid traffic, I like, I'll cry if we don't have an old bump or an upsell.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So let's, let's just kind of think about that real quick. And I think that, um, you could have that be, um, you know, it, maybe it is just an upgrade of another $100 a month, but then they get access to a higher level group and you'll answer personal questions, like we don't have to overcomplicate it, it could be critiquing, it could be like, you know, what are the typical upsells that? Oh, go ahead.
00:51:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I misunderstood. Um, I never liked selling anything recurring on a funnel, that type of traffic. So, well, except the $5 a month was a no-brainer for the school community, but so I was thinking that the current system, Iowa, um, pages for $97 one shot. So, so that one would have the order bump and the upsell because school doesn't allow order bumps.
00:51:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what I'm saying is what, what could be offered as an order bump so that we're maximizing on that.
00:51:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, um, I gave away so much, unfortunately, in the original thing. So, um, and if we're gonna keep it at 97, I don't think I'd want to take anything away. So the natural thing for especially an upsell is anything that accelerates that. Um, so, Well, usually it's templates, but I really kind of give away the templates they need. I can't I think I need to think about it.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Yeah.
00:52:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I mean, one thing I think that would be cool for them to have, but I don't want to deliver it is like once a week working sessions, like, you know, how you show me that one time for ADHD owners, but I don't want to deliver on that. don't want to, as an empath, that just kill me.
00:52:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I go through your templates and figure out what is still a good stack, but what can you separate? So that it doesn't have to be a big upsell and and also remember, you know, we're testing. This is what testing. So if we find that person's drop because you took something away, yeah, then, you know, we revamp it and we we learn. Um, but if if go ahead, I know a really good upsell.
00:52:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If we took out, because I don't know why much that sold on the sales page because I didn't really make it clear or talk about it a lot, but what would make a good upsell is something called the automated YouTube growth stack and it's us teaching them how to hire a VA, how to manage them. Here's the scripts. Yeah, like here's the SOP you give them, like the stuff that I was going to do in scribe anyway. That would be an amazing upsell one.
00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Higher VA scripts you give them. Remind me something else.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, a standard of frame seizures so that they literally can just give them, hey, here's the research and planning SOP. Go plan out four videos for me, you know, for this month. Here's the how to upload a YouTube video SOP, you know, go do this for me. Like it'd be systemized by the process.
00:53:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about this also?
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yes. Yeah.
00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so you and I, like, you know, yeah, we could do that. We could knock that out pretty quickly and we could get it done in two weeks. Yep. Um, I'm the kind of person who will stay up all night in the middle of the night to meet a deadline. And, um, I would rather not do that, I 100% with, like, I'm, I won't promise something and not fulfill it. So, um, I can't.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, that's how I work.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's how this YouTube thing got done.
00:54:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I didn't have pre sales of it, it would still be.
00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I should do this course. I know, but I want you to know that that's who I am too, because it hasn't yet yet. And, um, because we're talking about an aggressive timeline. And I know that you know that there are a lot of people be like, this is cool. Let's do this. And then crickets. Um, yeah, you're the one pulling the all nighter and doing that kind of stuff. So I want you to know that, like, I'm, I'm game for this. This is a sprint. And for me, you know, you kind of suffer for sprints a little bit and then you, you take break and so holidays are coming. That'll be a good break time and we will be able to coast through that off of the, the high of having served and delivered really well and we can spend, you know, a couple of weeks at the end of December, just really nurturing the group instead of creating anything or doing any webinars or anything, just spending whatever time that we are working, nurturing people, taking care of them, answering questions, letting them get to know us and the mama bears, like we are, um, and, and that can be where our personality and that part of the branding kind of comes through. And, uh, I think that that would be great. So, um, this. Yes. So. I don't want to. Oh, gosh. I got to go because I have to get ready for this call. So I think this was amazing. I don't want to laugh because it makes me cramp really bad.
00:56:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Okay.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So if we meet tomorrow, even honestly, I don't even think that we have to meet tomorrow. We can just start working. Man, why am I losing my breath? my asthma is bugging me really bad right now too. So, so let's see planning. So if we figure out what has to happen to make these happen. Yeah. What, like, what would you create? So the Trello board, like, I can create something, but all needs. some stuff to plug into it so I can see like, you know, what are you thinking? then I'll be able to riff off of what you create. But right now, like, I, there's a blank canvas in my brain. And so I'll a I'll do a quick loom video for you, because honestly, just face off the checklist in the Google spreadsheet, because that is my process. So, yeah, um, at Maria, please get me a transcript. And so we can start with that also. And so that should tag you. And we are going to have more tasks come out once I get that. And once you start with the the SOPs. And then we're going to be busy. Let's see. I would love to see if, if, If we can get a good turnout for two weeks from now, I would love to do it one more time while we're thinking and maybe take that best recording and turn it into an auto webinar.
00:58:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that'd be cool, yeah.
00:58:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or clip it and make VSL out of it or something like that. then we can script out and maybe make a better video and then talk about our own YouTube channel. But in the meantime, if we want to capitalize on making money, the fact that, you know, there's this end of the year buying, there's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the new year, you, all these types of things, then rather than try to make it perfect right now, let's just show up, you know, two more times, which is easy for me to say because I'm not the one showing up to do the webinar, but I think that as long as you're not overwhelmed with the rest of the work, that's kind of like an area that you like doing and you've already done the research. So I build an support for you in in between those times, I think it wouldn't be too much. But let me know if I'm wrong.
00:59:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's talk about it, you know, throughout the week, because I might. Yeah, because Sally started performing pretty good on on some of that funnel work for the other clients. So my time might be more freed up than I thought. So let's see.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, in terms of like, would you be willing to do two for live webinars, one in two weeks and one four weeks later?
00:59:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, when you mean live webbers, you mean, itching the thing, like people.
00:59:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what you just did.
00:59:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, absolutely.
00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. if that is something you're willing to do, and we do all the rest of this stuff, I think that that the revenue will come through that vehicle without a lot of complicated stuff while we build the fulfillment mechanisms, then we can build the automated leverage sales mechanism where you don't we're not doing like. webinars. We're doing either auto webinars or VSLs or creating a separate YouTube channel that is a magnet for leads and to this funnel anyway.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So simple and it's all because you did what you do naturally, just creating videos, doing research, discovered a system, wanted to teach it, and this blossomed out of Maria just being Maria.
01:00:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and so the only next thing to talk about, mainly miners, how to manage my time because now that I'm doing more of this, I'm more visible, I'm getting a lot of messages in my Facebook messenger, hey, we should connect. what about this?
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hey, I had a consult call few months ago, I'm thinking of in the most. should read that you can. So even if it's just audio voices and dumps, like these are the scenarios. These are the things that are coming up. I would like help with figuring out how to handle this. So right now I have a vague idea of what it is, but they claim I am on exactly what's happening. Okay. You know how to have some people, let's just do this, this, this, and this. We'll not available, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And just to handle it, because you don't need to do anything other than this and take care of the one guy that you have.
01:01:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's what I'm thinking and also just I don't want to also ruin good karma because some of these people are potentially good people for next year if we want to have one high ticket client for quarter one on one, you know? Right.
01:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then we use like, you know, I'm filled up until this time and this is what's coming on. Do you want to be at the top of the list? And if you do, it requires a deposit. And if you don't, No worries. I'm just reached out to me. if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. And I love it. And nobody gets offended by it. People do get offended by it. That automatically lets me know there were too much of a diva to work with anyway.

Hi, how are you?
00:00:18 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh. Um, I don't know how to answer that question. think you're the first one that question today. Ah, I think I need to go away. I know. I put them eyebrows.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, nobody wants to see me without eyebrows. They turn gray.
00:00:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So I have been doing this blurry thing since I've been doing a lot of, um, Oh gosh, I haven't talked to you, right?
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, for two weeks.
00:00:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh gosh, there's so many things that happen.
00:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do you want to start? Anywhere. Okay.
00:00:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Um, I, I. Oh, we will start on the day that we got that contract and then yeah, and then we had a party that day on and then the next day we like prepared for Japan I'm just trying to do the time like as it feels like a blur I That was about it. That was right around there when we talked we talked Face it 12 is when we got that meeting and then it's marks holiday both party for his His office and then we left the 14 And then we arrived at 15 We're in Tokyo while we are in Tokyo from 14 to 18 or 17 Everything is okay. Then we went to Kyoto the mama We went to Kyoto 18 19 like 19 is when the email starts going coming in I was like what's going on. I guess it's starting now. So I'm very stressed out at that. It's my first time that I had a vacation that I have to work. I never went on a trip that I have to work. I see Mark doing that. thought that my role with Mark is to make sure that he's relaxed and he's in the past. feel bad that he has to work. Now I understand how that feels. But at the same time, I know it's different because I'm just starting and we don't have any, I feel like we don't have anything in place other than the Google sheets. I'm glad that Cheryl actually did that. The Google sheets where she's just start like putting the patient's name, the date of birth. It's like very basic and they just hire her daughter to be part of, they call it lean department, which I'm leading, I guess, managing. It was built for me, basically, like, and she was just hired on the 11th, 12th, he's like very new. was scrambling, like, I'm so the stress level, I cannot even express how it is, although I try my best to enjoy my time there, which I did because it's in the morning and then from after 9 o'clock, we go around and 9 a.m.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I'm done with my notes and stuff.
00:03:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
try to – and Mark is there, which is – I think that, again, everything happens for a reason. Mark is right there with me and looking at the way I chart and telling me, like, okay, this is a good to go, was able to send in, but the orders were not sent because the – the triplicate that I was saying is It's for narcotics. The one that was actually stolen to part of the stolen stuff. So the triplicate And that's like another thing we'll talk later, but it's where we write MRI orders like MRI of the server neck I'm right, but you know back, but we don't need that. We don't need the triplicate We just need a regular paper with the doctor's name and signature Which I'm very happy that we did actually just two days ago or three days ago With mark mark help me that I think I sent it to you. I'm not sure I'm not sure if I did.
00:04:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know anymore.
00:04:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So what it's like a check-up order that if I see it So you know how that yeah, there's so many things that happen in this But we're focusing on the business, right? There's so many things that I There's days that I remember when we went to Tokyo again or she's she no go-ha mom. I think mark and I I'm having some arguments because I don't even remember why, but I think I'm just very stressed out, but it's like, and that's when I think you hurt me, I cry and like, um, the voice message, I feel, it's like a make-up break-y moment, like, can I really do this? But then in hindsight, like, you know, it's really okay, I just have to keep on going.
00:05:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:05:33 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So we're averaging, as of right now, I wanted to tell you exactly how much patient came in, who, including, like, holidays, right? There's two holidays and excluding weekend, I guess. But we have 32 patients from, where are you? Okay, we have 32 patients for it's like averaging four to five patients a day that I see that's a hundred a month which is amazing like our goal is 400 right but having 25% of the way there and about that is that is just crazy and I know this month is huge and I know obviously I won't be able to get this without Mark and his connection and the owner of sweet James is he he was in our wedding with us together like he knows us but he doesn't know me he's not Mark but he's been I don't know if Mark told he's been trying to get Mark back to work with him which he doesn't want to now but if there is a relationship and I am very stressed out I'm making sure that I don't it up because of Mark like I don't want him to I think that's initially where my thought process went is I don't want to embarrass him but at the same at the time, like, this is on me, like, Dr. E just doesn't, like, he just, like, I need not in any way, like, other than me calling him, like, hey, a situation, there's this patient, is this okay, like, I'm thinking to do this. So he's there when I call him. But he does not, he's not part of day to day seeing patients documenting nothing. So right now, the process, can I tell you the process is, I know, I feel like it's a lot because I'm doing the main part, but I'm going to give it to Bella next week.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Before you tell me that, the thing I want you to think about is, what would you have to do to consider something really being messed up? So let's break this down for a minute. There's a few different things. Number one, you could do something that gets a patient killed. We know that's not going to happen, right? We know. you're not going to do that. That's you have that expertise. You're not going to hurt somebody. You could not see somebody in time and something bad happens to them. We also know that's not going to happen, Jonah, right? It's not the way you operate. It's not going to happen. That's really the only thing that could actually be the biggest messes up is that something happens to the client that's detrimental. The worst thing that could happen is you don't get notes done in time. You miss something in the note, but I don't think you would miss anything that's detrimental, right? It could be something that maybe doesn't help them when the case is much. So, but that is huge in error and that's going to happen a percentage of the time with just about anybody. So the odds that you would make a mistake that is like absolutely unacceptable. I don't believe it's something that you can or would do. So you are going to make mistakes and sometimes it may cost somebody something, but I promise you that everybody that they work with including themselves make those types of mistakes. Mark makes those mistakes very rarely, but they happen. Sweet James, everybody in there is going to make those types of mistakes. So what they're going to do to evaluate that, right? Like I said, unless you did something that's like a detrimental life or death to the client, they're going to look at that and go, that really sucks. Jonah and they're probably going to yell or whatever and then get it out and then put it in perspective and go, yeah, but she shows up every day. She can take the feedback. She doesn't something wrong. I need to make a mistake. I need to be corrected on a mistake. And then she keeps improving. So they're not going to measure you according to the mistake that you made. They're going to. It will feel like that in the moment. That's what it feels like when we make mistakes. That's all we can think about.
00:10:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's all we feel.
00:10:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then, because of the nature of their business, they have to learn how to put things in a perspective. Keep people. There aren't a lot of people that can do what you do. There's competition and there are a significant amount, but they don't all show up. They don't all break really good notes. They do not all have really notes. It's not all timely. And they don't all meet their patients, love them like yours do. So, your value is going to buy you some leniency, if and when you do make your mistakes. You can't mess this up so bad that marks reputation is completely tamed. Whatever mistakes you will make and you will make them, they will not be detrimental. to mark in his relationship. Even if he gets stressed out and think that that's a possibility, it's not going to happen because Mark has a tendency to worry and stress too much as well. But he's also really good at putting it back in perspective and go, you know what, it'll be what it'll be. But if you two feed off of each other, stress moment, then those are going to be periods of animosity. what you need to do is say, you know what, I need the mark that says everything's going to be okay. Because I know you have that in you. That's what he is. When I'm sitting there and he's told me something bad that's happening, oh, I feel sorry. I feel like a mama and I just want to be like, how can I make it better? And he'll be like, but everything will be okay. I'm like, well, like I know you how I have to go there because I'm normally like, does he ever tell you what my nickname is for him?
00:11:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
No.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or you want to know why every time we would get on the call like how you doing I'm like what is wrong with you I was just so like two years later I'm like I'm just gonna call you E or because and now he is very cognizant of not showing up that way he didn't like it but he also wasn't you know a child about it he kind of realized that I said it for a reason I didn't say it to insult him or degrade him I said it because that's not helpful it's just not if you want to be unhappy then focus on the things that aren't great and it's not that he doesn't have real hard things going on you know but we have to like I've told you we have to focus on what we want to grow so if you want the good things to grow you have to focus on on, on what growth. So, but what happens is, so I heard something probably about 10 years ago that shifted me. I like, I feel like crying again, just thinking about it, because I thought about how much I did it, how much my family did it, how much most people did it. And that is that we give our best manners and behavior to complete strangers and everyone other than our family. And we say, well, it's because our family, they can handle the real us, and we can be ourselves. But what they mean is, I can be rude, I can be snappy, I can be short because I'm in a bad mood. What really should happen is we give our best to the people that we love the most, our most politeness, our most good, you know, our greatest amount of respect. And we should hold our tongues and master our tongues better around the people that we love. And this is like I can cut somebody down in half with my words in half a second and put them for decades. And I used to be proud of that. And it's a terrible thing. I was proud of it because I was hard a lot and I only did it to mean people and it wasn't okay because it came out a lot. And I realized I really have to think about my words. Because I'm clever and witty, I could say really hurtful things, not even just thinking I'm joking. I'm funny. Not funny. I've watched marriages be destroyed over that kind of stuff. So when it comes to like the worry and the stress and the fear and the pressure, you guys have to remember that you have to give each other your best. Like if this was an employee or this was a best friend, what would you say? to them. How would you use your words then? Our parents, children, spouses, they should get our very, very, very best. And it's really hard to do sometimes. But I think that the two of you can have the most powerful support of each other because I know that you love each other and I know you believe in each other and I know that you like working together. So if you can figure out how to read each other when you need different things, when you need that support and you need that encouragement. And if you can tell yourself, this is the person that gets me through everything, I need to not hurt him. He needs to not hurt you. Not that you've never do it intentionally. We do it accidentally. That's my whole point, is we just, we're in our homes and we let our guards down, but what that can can mean is we also let ourselves react in ways that really we shouldn't. And that's us backwards. Because I think that your greatest strength is going to be, at least when it comes to this business stuff, is marked. And likewise, that's what I think about families, you're going to be able to get through all of this stuff. And I think another thing that would be good. So you've got me, but if there are other women, so just kind of like raise up your antenna to notice like when you meet a woman, maybe at an event or something, and you feel like you kind of click with her, and maybe like you have either similar or complementary personality types and things.
00:16:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have two right now.
00:16:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, that is awesome.
00:16:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
The one is a, she's younger than she's, she's so much her. I, we, oh. These two women are connected because of love of luxury, so that's how we connected the other. The one woman she's in for, she has an Airbnb, she's the eldest, so it's a family business that kind of handed on to her, so she's ever since, she's very mature, she's basically doing Airbnb business. And the other one, she's Japanese, has a, I don't understand fully her business, but I talked to them and I did ask the Japanese, she's a little reserved, she's, that's how her personality is, but both of them really just told me, because what do you do when you feel like you don't, you want to feel like keep on going? And they said, and you feel overwhelmed, and then they, both basically say the concept is just to keep on going, keep on working. So I wanted to tell you this, this past two weeks. I cried a lot. And because I feel overwhelmed, some Mark saw, some Mark, he didn't, like this Monday, he's, we push our buttons intentionally. I mean, unintentionally, like, I asked his help about this order set. I said, can I see a sample of your doctors, you just have to redact the names and the things. I just need to see how they order stuff because we cannot use the triple kit on all time because we're not prescribing narcotics. We're just recommending physical therapy and get an MRI. So he showed me a checklist and he has, he helped me do it from something to Adobe. And I'm technologically challenged. I mean, I just can't, I don't do them. But anyway, he's so. He's helping me and he's very frustrated because he's also in pain. I don't know, he told me I was pain on his knee and he's very snappy and I said, it's okay, just eat first and I know he's very rare mark with that snack, but he can.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pain will, pain makes everything go out the door because and then I said, it's okay, I told him it's okay, just eat or whatever, but he wants to do it for me.
00:19:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
He knows, I need, he knows I need it. So he's very snappy with me and then I just started crying, but I keep on working. Like I got his own, he can't see, we cry and I just keep on working. I'm not crying more because of how he is.
00:19:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know he's in pain frustrated. That's all for a while, it's a relief.
00:19:54 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's a frustrating part that I don't know how to do it myself, that I will always see.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and to help me like I don't want that in general. Do you want me to teach you things?
00:20:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I just I definitely feel like I need the how to edit the things because right now it's more work because I have to input each. I don't know how to share. I want to show you what I'm seeing. Can I go there and share? What do I do?
00:20:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, click share and then you can either choose we know.
00:20:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I click sharing your screen sharing. Can you see it? Yes. this this is the right now. This is the in case the Cheryl started and then we input stuff. example, a patient's name and the date of injury and birth and the priority. That's what she did. This is not me. This is just all her and and status. So when we have an email, we put. situation's same birthday and the status I put scheduled and This is my note supposedly and this is Bella's note And who's the case manager? So we're this is what she did and I think it's nice. I think it's okay. I'm sure eventually But so far we're at 32 32 and she put other liens here for me from other Which I haven't inputted anything yet. I haven't put inputted the last the last ones I got This is the lead She shared me the charges Oh Okay, she shared these are the charts so now I'm doing the billing because I want To to do this first, I know it's going to be more work, but I'm doing the buildings. So this is the billing and this is this is the orders right now. Okay, I have to input each name here, copy, paste the name here, put the birthday, put the address, put the date that I ordered it.
00:22:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is the one that Mark did for me. So check that I kind of pick and choose which ones leave behind.
00:22:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then this is the black one. I added this and I removed some stuff. This is like three texts. And then the electronic signature is already there. So I have to do this each and every once. I feel like it's tedious. I want to integrate eventually here. This is our this is our charting system. So later on, once Dr. E arrive from Australia, and then once I get back from Paris, I guess I want to integrate here when are you guys leaving and coming back so we're I'm well Right now. It's it's still continue. I think we should continue. I mean our life should continue I know I just want to know because it does I know I'm sorry. I meant because it's I feel like it's still I've hung up in the air like I don't know how mark feels how his mom feels because it's his mom's birthday Oh, but if it ever it's January Not at nighttime of January night.
00:23:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what a week Okay, and then how long will you be gone?
00:23:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think the 18 or 17.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay It's a week. Yeah So Yeah, do you want me to stop? Yeah, I just want to tell you something really quick and then I keep keep going but the the way that a I have evolved this year. A lot of this stuff, you probably will be able to integrate and put together. The limitation is that anything that has to be HIPAA compliant is going to be slower than the rest of the stuff. But lots of people want this, so this will happen quickly. you will run your business best when you understand how everything works. it will be best for you to gather the skills and to get them because you'll be better at hiring and managing the people who help you in the future if you know how to do it yourself. So the way that I want you to kind of always think about it is when there's something to be done, it's um I do it and that's you, right? That's you and the person that you're hiring and then it's you do it. So I do what we do what you do it. So you always learn how to do it first, then you do it together and then you have them do it and then you just watch from time to time. And that just, like I said, just makes sure that you understand, it also helps us to not overburden somebody. It's very easy to hire somebody and think, that's really easy. You should be done by now, but when you've done it, you have a little more respect for who you're hiring and who you're managing.
00:25:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I wanted to tell you, like I talked to well on Monday Tuesday, like I called her, I said, and talked to her even when I was in Japan, we did a like a FaceTime with Cheryl, her and I, and then now we've been talking separately, like I told her I want you, I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, I know she's new, this is, I'm trying to, you know, obviously the sense of ownership will eventually be up to her, but I wanted to include her, like on everything, said both of us are starting this, so I don't want you to feel it. I basically call her, I'm always here, but anyways what I'm doing now and you tell me if this is wrong, is I want her to listen to how I
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
call the patient.
00:26:01 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm trying to tell her how the process is. The first process is when the email comes in. Our goal is to make sure that we call the patient and set an appointment right away. And I will tell her that in 30 minutes, 30 minutes each patient, these are the block of hours. want you to schedule for me. I have yet to email her dad. supposed email that yesterday for her because we just talked. Of course, I wasn't able to do that. But that was my plan is to tell her, for example, from Monday to Friday, these are the block of times I want you to fill them up with patients. So that's my plan. And we weren't able to do it with one patient yesterday, wherein he can hear how I talked to the patient, how I made this schedule. And I just have to write it down. have yet to write it down. So I told her from the email comes in, call the patients, put them on our Google drive your information, start the chart on our software and then send a zoom link meeting. Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. Sorry. I have to write it down.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But she, I told the first assignment. Okay. Tell me I'm going to write it down. Okay. What happened first?
00:27:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So first is when the email comes, I told her to, I guess, put it in the Google drive. I want her to have her own flow, but I told it put it the Google drive, call the patient, set up an appointment based on the block time I gave you in 30 minutes, fill it up and set up appointment based off the blocks that I have yet to give her. But yeah, box schedule and 30 minutes at a time. now, eventually I'll get faster. I actually added something, I told her while you're on the phone with the patient, send the lean agreement, the electronic lean consent agreement, which she actually did and she just finished it. Because I told her I need this, the first time I talked to her last week while I honest, I did ask her that we're both learning the Adobe, I guess, that you all don't like the part we're in after they sign. Something is sent to their email and they have to verify that first. So she's trying to see if we can remove that because if a patient elder is patient, how do they go back and forth to the go back to the email and verify like we're trying to make it because because it's an electronic signature, you may not be able to get around that because there has to be something.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and kind of verification that the person signing is the correct person.
00:29:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now what I've been doing is sending the PDF scan document which is actually like sent it and I told the patient to sign it and give it to me and they're actually giving it back to me.
00:29:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they can even with Adobe they can print it from their wet signature and bring it to you if you want that.
00:29:25 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean email the email is back to me.
00:29:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know but I'm saying if you want to skip the authentication where they're not signing they can probably just print it. You can have an email to them where they print it, wet signature, bring it back. So but one of the others is going to have to happen because it is a authentication. The whole point of a signature is authentication.
00:29:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So yeah so that's something that we're trying to work on. In the meantime I'm giving them a PDF form. It's not assignable. It's just seen the patient printed, they've been printing it and writing it in pen. So that's because 99, I would say 95% of these patients or 99, the first meeting is video like Dr. Fuji. Unless we're going to do procedure, that's the time that will come to the clinic. So I told her while you're on the phone, do the send them after you schedule them, send them the lien document to sign and send it before or after. You know, we're trying to be flexible with them. And then thirdly, I want you to ask a simple medical and surgical history. And I have yet to write it down for us. That's actually what keeps me the time on my 30 minutes with them.
00:30:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have those questions?
00:30:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I have those questions.
00:30:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, are they in your head or are they right now? Okay, tell me.
00:31:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So basically I asked do you have any medical history sometimes they say oh I'm fine I'm healthy but the next question is do you take any medication regularly oh I said oh yeah I'm taking cholesterol medication so you have high cholesterol so it's just oh but I'm fine now well you're fine because you're not cholesterol medical but anyways I'm trying to teach her how to get that information so I need the medical and surgical history that's it the rest I will ask I just need those two for you to write it down and then I'll figure it out later and maybe there is a way that will be easier for her maybe just a checkup or type I'm not entirely sure what else currently in the in our current charting system it is um maybe I should just tell her to open create the chart open the note open a note and because She's part of the note that's checklist, but she has to look for it, you know? I don't know if it's going to be harder for her. easier for her to type, but I thought about it. She's not a medical drink. She does not have a medical background. So if a patient tells her, oh, I I don't know, carpal tunnel repair or something like that. She may not know how to spell it, and I don't want her to film. So I'm trying to see what's going to This is very easy.
00:32:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if it's a spelling thing, you just literally go at, if she has Siri or Google, ask, how do you spell carpal tunnel? Right. So you don't actually need to, you can look it up and Google picks it too, but either way, she can just ask that.
00:32:46 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It is better to ask and then check off on our checkup system on our chart, patient's charts that she can, once you open new notes, there is a checkup there. Yeah.
00:32:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so, so think about Oh, what you get when you go to a new doctor, they ask you all of this medical history. They ask you if you have any known allergies to medications.
00:33:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's going to be something that's important for you.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking any current medications?
00:33:14 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
you want to make sure that you don't have any. So actually for us, the only medication that because with the lean patients, I there's only one that I prescribe medications, but the prescribing medications is kind of. What's the term? I avoid it for lean patients. Yeah, we reach for some reason that was the practice, but I don't like narcotics. don't like Fuji does not give their heart. He will probably give some muscle relaxants, but not narcotics, right? for my health insurance, chronic pain, every month patients, I give narcotics to them. So for me, It's like, yeah, so it's very, very rare, and the other thing is if we're going to do an epidural, I will ask, are you on blood thinners? And I have some very specific question because those are the ones that will affect the procedure. So, I mean, again, I'm trying not to make Bella a work a lot because I don't want her to feel overwhelmed, but I need those two.
00:34:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need medical history. That's not the way to do this, the right person for you is the one that helps you the amount that you need. So, it's not your job to worry about if they're overwhelmed. It's your job to find out if they can handle the job. Does that make sense?
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's still hard for me to grasp the concept because my mentality is I want to be a part of it rather than, I don't know what the term.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're delegating your application. don't want to have the you want to delegate. But you thinking about the entire process, and you should be reviewing all the notes, it won't take you nearly as long to read them as it will for you to put them in. So, and whether you read them all, although I would, because you're accountable for all of them, it's saving you time to have her input everything, but you're still reviewing it. And from time to time, so she'll be on calls with patients asking these information, right?
00:35:35 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, so that when she get, like I said, when she get, I was trying to tell her the steps, so when she get the email, call the patients, and this is what I want her to start doing, like just ask for medical and surgical history.
00:35:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what we'll be in email, right?
00:35:55 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, when the email comes, I told her it's very important, our response time. You know, it's fast. I told her once we get it, put in Google Drive the information, call the patient set up an appointment based on that time frame of 30 minutes. And then while on the phone, help them send the, what do you call that, the electronic consent patient. So we will need patient's email. So there's actually nothing on the Google Drive with the patient email, may have to add that. Because right now I'm just writing it on my notes as I talk to them. So I have it on my phone notes. So, and then I said that I told her to set up, while you're setting up the schedule, initially I told her, you can have access on my Zoom link. And then Cheryl said, why are you assuming we have a Gmail? count that can do that for you. There's like a zoom meeting, like a meeting. And the Google Meet. And she said it's HIPAA compliant. I know Mark told me that the zoom is HIPAA compliant. But again, I think it's okay. She told me she's okay. So I'm going to start telling Bella to start doing it on Google Meet and then start plugging in schedules there. For right now, 30 minutes per patient, eventually I'm going to get faster and do 20 or 15 minutes each patient, which is the standard anyways. So right now it's two patients an hour, but the goal is to do four patients an hour and be faster and so if I do Yeah, so I mean, four times, yeah, if I do four patients an hour in four hours, I can have 80 patients a week. That is very close to getting 400 a month, like that's very doable, like if I just do four-hour patients, like, and this is just California, like I haven't even touched it later on in the Washington, like it's actually perfect timing, like you said, everything I need to hone is done. Everything that I do now will prepare me for Washington. So yeah, I don't know if it's a check-off is better or hurt.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Typing let's let's let's just say this. Um, template. We're going to call it template. Um, So, let's do one. Let's think about this. Let's. Where's my undo thing? We moved the alert is. Um, what did you do that? Oh, that's why. Okay. Okay. let's see. You It's one one No, I'm just giving an example date. I know what it is So that we want to highlight this because this is the very first up like dude, okay, then put Singing into patient like there's a folder it's called Thomas lean Yeah That's what the folder name is, Chona's Lean, Chona's Lean Case, Chona's Lean Case is actually So yeah, I mean Okay, so let's see Let me think about the exact water I forgot to put water Oh, that cough. It's crazy how long coughs can linger. There's some new things in here that's pretty cool. I'm just trying to think of, so here's what we're going to do. Because you can have one doc that is a checklist with instructions that has all of this. But then you can also have a template that she just saves a copy and fills out. I think that that's probably the better thing to do is create a checklist and she can either open it or print it off. The thing with printing off is if you go and make an update, then she's got an old copy. So anytime you update, you say shred the one you've got, make a new one, print it up.
00:43:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
mean, the checklist for her when I mean, came, it comes in.
00:43:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, like, right. So we could have one thing that's a checklist, right? That says, these are all the things you're gonna get. And then the other thing is an actual document that's got all of that stuff in it.
00:43:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, no, we're thinking of writing it on that temporary document that this one she created a, she can all this, she can all do this in the form. It's a matter of obviously being fast. It's like, she put the pages on the Google Drive. Whatever. For her flow is eventually, she will eventually have her flow, but I want this all done and I want her to create a chart, creating a chart needs name, birthday, and she can put the address later. When she created a patient's chart, she can open a note or a memo for non provider for non doctor non NPE staff, and they can write whatever they want, they can they can free text. So that's what I was thinking of, where to put the medical and surgical history, either a memo or either open a chart where in, there's a check off. have, I do want me to show you.
00:44:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:44:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay.
00:44:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me stop. Sure. There you go.
00:44:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
How do I? Okay. Share. Share. Okay. Okay. So. This is our thing. For example, I'm going to do a test. Yes. 10. test. So she could this is a new chart, for example, the patient, she can put under here notes, either create memo, or where she can free write, this is what memo looks like. And I can just write like that, you can save it, or do a new patient form. But this is not the note that I use for liens. The note that I use for liens is so, because the soap is just very simple. So these are minus the medication. Think about the medication, but I did objective, objective, and there's nothing in here about medical, surgical history. So I don't know which one is better for her.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's probably you should have both. Like, you. This is the thing, it does not matter what business we're starting with, does not matter what business I'm working with, people have a tendency to want to do less work, thinking that somehow that's better.
00:46:16 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So this is, I want to show you, this is the new note, this is our note for health regular health insurance and this one right here PMHX primary medical history. So when you click this, it's like a check off box.
00:46:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so all the patients, for all the diseases, and then you can also free type here.
00:46:42 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, and then she can save it. But the thing is, if she do that, then I have to open this.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not combine them? Can you not create a whole new form that combines both of them?
00:46:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, you can. So like for example, So this one, I will open soap, because that's what I use for liens, this one right here is called soap note that will integrate this note that I just did. However, it's not going to copy the medical history, because the soap note does not have a medical center.
00:47:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, what I'm saying is, as like a template form, so like in your dropdown menu, you have all these different options, right? So note is one of them, right? All of those, what I'm saying is, can, and you may have to ask what the name of the company is, what is that? Can you make me a form that combines soap with with medical history? Yes, because then you have it all in one file, all right, so you're not opening multiple things. I don't see why they wouldn't do that for you.
00:47:56 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, that would be I'll be making. Oh, also. Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Um, you can, you can actually do this. No, how do I? Okay. You can do this one. I can create my own notes. It's just macros that I don't know how to do this. Cheryl just told me this the other day. He's like, this is mine and I can create.
00:48:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So look, this is, I'm going tell you the fastest way to do this. Go click on the, the help, the question mark at the top of the menu. Um, in the blue, top right of the screen, like by your account.
00:48:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Over little bit more right here.
00:48:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. on that. Scroll down. All the way down.
00:48:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think this one took place. The list of template. I don't need to. I don't That's, I don't want that. This one. No types. This is what she told me. Customize a list of no types. And there's like a macro.
00:49:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just show you real quick because I don't know if this is what you show me. I'm going to hold on. going to go Google something. How do I combine notes, type templates in Deborah?
00:49:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Here create template. Is this one right here? But then it's macro. Like I don't know this title.
00:49:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, the title is Chona's notes or something like that.
00:49:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You can just do lean notes. Okay. I guess me. And version one.
00:49:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:49:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
then I don't know what's next.
00:49:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, uh,
00:50:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I, this, this is what I don't know why I know it's very, um, my, it's macro. So I, they told me to, how about I'll just add stuff at a section or at a care plan. I just have to play around with it. So at a section, maybe, um, don't know, is there a drop down menu? Uh, no, uh, there. Oh, it, these are like the, the, what's already being used to exam in detail. don't know if this is correct, exam gen detail.
00:50:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Click on that and see what happens.
00:50:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Uh, save, just go save and see what happens. Can you just add that there? Um, yeah, I think this is like, more, I can call the customer service and that's what I would do. And then, um, I'm going to tell you, like this,
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People resist calling support or getting support. It is the fastest way to get exactly what you want.
00:51:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It will save you hours of frustration. That's what happened. That's why I was able to get the um remember the able to this is the the system where I was able to give electronic prescription. This was the problem. Yeah. then the other doctor who came at this and the new doctor came in at the same time with me. He still cannot. It's only with already been mine.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You go to the expert. If you need something, you go to the expert. Their support knows their software. And if they won't do it for you, say, do you have um affiliate like like a partner agency that I can hire who can go do this for me? For sure. All you want to do all you like there are two forms that are exactly what you want.
00:51:49 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You just need to merge them, right? Right. And this one, I need this exactly this one. of me writing the name Databrit, I just all like, you know, manually. So what I mean, these are my annually copying the name and this is so much work. want this to be integrated in that system.
00:52:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you give them like have a copy that has what you want and that doesn't have any patient information say, I need soap, I need this, I need this. I need them in one form. Please make it for me or tell me who I can hire to have it made for me.
00:52:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. Because these are all like electronic everything is done.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You said, hold on a second. Do they have a um, Tebrat? Does Tebrat have email or help? That's support. Once again.
00:52:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I hope this. Yeah, I believe so. That's that. That's how I called. did both.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did help this and call. Yeah. Yeah, I would just call him today is New Year's Day. So they're probably not open but tomorrow Chona. I would. I really want you to be accountable to do this thing because it's going to make your life so much easier. Yeah. I want you to commit to me to call them tomorrow and ask them for this.
00:53:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Will you do that? Yeah, I need to do this. I need to call them for this. And in the meantime, I think for Bella, she can just type it whatever, however she understood.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would also tell her I'm going to have somebody build this for us. So it's just going to be all in one so that she knows you're proactively doing this. Just, of course, thank her like, you know, like this. Yeah, I'm really grateful that you're here to help with this. This is stressful. And I'm going to make sure that it's as easy for both of us and that we enjoy doing the work.
00:53:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
What do you think of this one so far? Like what how Cheryl did this is what we're doing right now. I'm just copy casing it. And I'm just putting my notes here.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's a good start. But the thing that I love about CRM type The thing database like Deborah is that you you probably have a better search function a reporting function It's going to be a lot easier to print out for the attorneys for you to be able to send them the documents And so what I do is after there's a document here.
00:54:15 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It's so easy. I just download it Then I send it I copy the building is also done here. It's very I already took over those which is actually very good I think Cheryl and I already got into this space where I'm not there to take her day I'm there to make sure it's not a lot of work for her So I think we're there Within this sort of we're there like she was also text because I told her about what happened and she's very And I think we're okay. I understand how she is. I think she understand what I need and it clicked right away like Yeah, so I think we're good in terms of that because it's so easy for her to give out and remember before she's like No, let us do the building.
00:55:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But now he's like, okay, this one, he showed me how to do it.
00:55:05 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, share me the charges. So, well, and if you bring them into the age of technology and simplifying things where they've got everything they maybe knew they should have been doing but weren't doing because it was too hard, they're going to love you for it. And the more the longer you're there, the safer Cheryl will feel.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you kind of got to bear down on all of this and know that I love the scripture that says you shall know that by their fruits. most people don't think about things like that, but we do measure people like that. We measure what's happening. So, fear is natural and it's going to happen. But when a person just keeps showing up consistently, good constantly, being helpful constantly, like eventually you're like, you know what, that person's good because you get the same kind of fruit all the time. know what I mean?
00:55:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And they saw me work well, I was in Japan that I, you know, when I talked to them, I was did you kind of be huge. They saw the work and she told me like, no, I you're much better to work with. Dr Lee, so hard to get him to do things for me.
00:56:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, they're going to love you, first of all, because you're just able to love. But yeah, but that's why though, Chona is because you have such a good heart, but you also show up and and you work. So it's not just you have a good heart and I wish things were nice.
00:56:34 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You have a good heart and you roll up your sleeves and get to work to make it nice. Right.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll definitely.
00:56:40 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. And I told them, no, I fully, I know the gravity. I'm not taking this lightly. I am full on it. I can't believe how fast I can do the note. No, it's got to keep getting better.
00:56:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, is there's going to be a tipping point where like, okay, you can get better.
00:57:03 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay, it was not perfect. Obviously, like when I was a little gentler coming in this past couple of days, I have you know that are like not done. But the essentials, like the case manager, by the way, I just want to tell you real quick, there's a case manager there that we are like, we are in sync. I asked her, I told her, like, you know, I want to know, I don't want to bother, you know, I was like, I actually like you're very responsive. You know, that's like, okay, that's a good feedback. So it's easy for us to like text each other, call each other. And so, so far, you know, she's she's just one department. And she's her department, the one that's giving me like all of this. And I am, I don't know, that's the combination of stress and excitement at the same time. But I feel good. I like the idea that if I travel, I can still make have some money and
00:58:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're crazy. I love that. I go on trips and because of the way that I've got my business, I've spent 22 plus years working on. So what I work on is making sure that I keep learning the highest value thing. So I keep learning new technology. I keep learning new systems and new automations so that I can keep saving people more time, more energy, so that they can make more money. So I get paid really well for it, This is what you're doing. leveraging your expertise to be like this.
00:58:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Nursing is one thing, but nursing and managing lean patients for attorneys is a whole new ball game. So because number one, I get paid really well and because it's all zoom and emails and whatnot, I can take it anywhere.
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, any world and because I'm not doing it time. Once you don't work, I can still enjoy wherever I go. Even if I still work on vacation, it's maybe a couple hours a day and the rest of the time.
00:59:08 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, which is the day. Yeah, it's a life I choose all day, every day.
00:59:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would rather have that than like this nine to five where I can only take a couple weeks off.
00:59:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I can go on vacation any time I want. And I told Dr. E already, there is the hospital, you know, I still wanted to continue for now. I definitely like the hospital setting, the hospital patients. But I already kind of told him that the Monday to Tuesday between 1.30 to 4.00 or 4.30 that I'm there. Seeing patients in the clinic, sometimes they give me 20 and only 10 show up.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I feel like that's not a good use of my time.
00:59:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And I told him, I'd rather have the telemedicine patients because I can still be. calling them and still take care of the link patients and the hospital patients. So eventually I have to let go of that afternoon set time. Like I, although I don't know, I'm still in the works on end. So I don't know what the right thing to do, although Cheryl thinks a Thursday afternoon specifically for me because right now the office is in the afternoon on Thursday, they want to open that up specifically for me, lean, not just my lean, but also take care of these lean patients.
01:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, so always remember that you're the architect, but in this balance where you're unsure, just keep showing up even if it's not optimal for a while because what happens is there comes this breaking point, this tipping point where you you've and it's usually a very stressful period where you're kind of balancing this act and then you let this thing go because you're already got this thing. What happens is most people want to jump to this thing after it shows up without this being stressful. It's not like that. You basically end up having both at the same time before you let it go. So you'll be really full, really busy and go, okay, this doesn't make any sense anymore. And then in terms of like explaining what you're doing and why you want to do it because I think sometimes you struggle with the yeah, but you know I need to be there to help him whatever. Always remember that you're not like anybody else. You're not employee. You're not his nurse, right? You are here as a profit partner. Always remember this profit partner. You're a profit partner. Okay, so your role is you came here to make money for both of you as optimized as possible. the way that you optimize for him, you're making Cheryl better. You're making his this better. He's already giving you that feedback. Okay, but the cost of that to him is you don't get the bottleneck me having me be at the hospital and not filling up my time. But now you don't say it that way, right? But that's what I need you to understand is that because of the gift that you give, you also get to give that to yourself. You don't get to give him all the blessings and take care of all the business and just take all the burden off of him, right? And then let burden be put on you in reciprocity.
01:02:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That doesn't make any sense. So actually, remember, I remember you asked me what's my ideal schedule? I'm thinking, I'm thinking in my head right now, what I can see is go to the hospital early. I need to knock that off early. Um, either I'm still deciding, you know, I know I need to be consistent either go there at six thirty or seven o'clock and be done. acts an hour and rounding my patients and then go back home and start my day in the morning and this is right now the morning is for my telemedicine patients but eventually once Washington started I want the morning but again obviously I want something doesn't mean that it's gonna be perfect I want that to be the time and then in the afternoon will be the lean patients here and then I'm going oh it may not be perfect but you being really specific about what you want gives you the best chance of getting exactly what you want what I have noticed is that number one that that is true period but what will happen is the Tina today that's making that plan and that vision will get right up to there and go oh now that I'm here and experiencing this it could be even better right but
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wouldn't have known that until I'd gotten to that point. So keep doing that, keep figuring out, you know what, this would probably work best. And then know that you're not going to know if it's best until you've lived it and allow yourself to continually be fluid, changing shape according to whatever is happening.
01:04:18 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because right now that's, that is definitely what's happening. And I'm actually, I actually want, I just realized Wednesday, because I know we set the time. And this is the time for like prime time for my patients.
01:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like, it is because they're here. You know that because you're here, right? That's exactly what I'm talking about.
01:04:41 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're like, Oh, now that I see like from 11 to three to four, like those are the times that I've been setting up my patients. But I don't know if it's because I'm adjusting it on my Japan time. But now that I'm, yeah, seriously. And now that I'm Here, I remember scheduling a patient, yes, Monday from 12 and 12 p.m. onwards. So, you know, I guess the reason why I'm saying that is because we have one meeting. So if I give block time to Bella, like, do you need to change your time? Is that what you're saying? I don't know. Or do I, do you be in So the brain have a break.
01:05:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know what the So, I mean, I keep a pretty light schedule on purpose with some flexibility, but I also don't have a ton. Like, I have a certain amount of window, but we can figure out something probably. So whether it's a different day that it does infect things or different time, we can figure it out.
01:05:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But it has to, yeah, you tell me, you know, which day and so if you were to create the schedule, wanted right now.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One time. would you be able to meet on what days?
01:06:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I think if I am. I think I just don't want to discount the 12 o'clock time because some of the patients are working and that they're but without without worry.
01:06:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you were not worried about what Tina thought or anybody else thought and if you could do it ideally, what would you do?
01:06:31 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
For our meeting? Yeah, right. OK, I like the Wednesday, the middle of the week. I I'm really thinking, I really don't know. Well, here's between 11 to one. Like that time period, like 11 to 12 or I'm not sure. think that would be the time because I've noticed I'm start I'm putting in patients 12 o'clock.
01:07:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I have mission meetings from nine o'clock to 10 and 10 to 11. So I would become so every other week is my 10 to 11. So on some of those days, I won't probably be as mentally prepared as I am. But okay, as long as we're talking well and we're doing our good work, it won't matter. Just know that like normally what I do is create a lot of buffer space before call so that I'm sitting here.
01:07:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm looking at all your notes. It's fresh in my mind.
01:07:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if I if you want to just do 30 minutes or you think an hour, it's a question. Well, it depends on what you need. If if sometimes a half an hour might be okay, but for the most part an hour. And you know, also it depends on how much we're talking throughout.
01:08:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
week.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, like you and I sometimes were texting a lot and that can be enough. It depends on your need. I don't ever want you to feel like I needed more and you don't get it.
01:08:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Like right now, and I'm not worried about it because there's stuff to catch up on and we need to do.
01:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I won't have any calls after that. So it would be only you needing to run to go get to a patient.
01:08:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
If you wanted more time, I'd be able to give that to you. Right. Okay. So is it between 11 to 12? Okay.
01:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We could do that. Yes. And also because my mission meetings are not, they're not like my work stuff. They're, they're training, but they're not, they're not draining at much slower pace. I'm not the one mentally creating everything and stuff like that. it's not, it's not a burden. I really enjoy them. They're a, ooh, emotions, a blessing.
01:09:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, good. And maybe that's great. Perfect then. So that way I can get the secondary energy from it. There's so much things that are happening. And I'm very glad that we were able to catch up because I feel like, I don't know if you can feel it like so much. It's like, I feel like I'm just vomiting with the stuff that happened. And I do, I think I'm gonna try to, you know, succinctly because I'm not, I know I'm not a good story color, but I would succinctly say that now it felt good. It felt good to have that account locked in. I know this is a trial period, this first month. I know that. That's what's very important throughout the past few days. We already figure out like what work, what doesn't work. Like the, the, the triplicates, I already said this is not gonna work. We can't do every patient every order like this. So we did the checklist, which is really great. Everything is in there. And then the lean is being digitalized, which is great. And then I learned from the case manager, she told me what's important for them because every firm, I guess, is different. For them, what's important, that checklist prescription that I just showed you. The notes and the billing is not as important for them. They're like, that could be days later.
01:10:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't care.
01:10:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Such kind of, in a way, put a little bit of a pressure with myself because myself is like, I'm putting the notes first. And then I'd say, RX, the RX prescription and billing to follow. But now because of communication, I learned that they need the RX first. So now, after every session, while I'm with the patient, I'm clicking off already.
01:10:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I say send it to them. That's whatever. Love you. This is gonna be I know it's trial. They're gonna there would be no reason for them to not do business with you I'm excited for you. I'm so proud of you.
01:11:09 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
You're going through so much I think I can go through so much and that's why I said I need to talk to you because I feel like I need to be Grounded I feel like I'm a grounded person anyways But I think I need to be grounded in this particular aspect of my life because this is like my act I'm holding on to this one because I know this is my win that I know I will win this year. So it's like I don't want to interrupt you. No go ahead.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would just add one more thing and you might have already done something like this But when when I am going for our things like I just have so much love for the people that are going through it with me and who are helping me so My type of gift giving is generally words because I feel like that's something that I have
01:12:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
By the way, good and I've learned that so that's what I give but for you like you like luxury things Like maybe you give something to Cheryl and Bellant. It did actually I figured I mean if you're close by I was like I know you're I mean I didn't know your address actually But mark maybe a mark that but I I know she loves because Cheryl and I again I think we connected now I mean week within the four months that we know each other is connected. I was able to I'm a very personable person anyways like I just I don't have problems like you know you're awesome with people but I learned she loves vintage brooch any like stuff and then in Japan I saw the Chanel brooch and it's 2005 so this vintage Chanel stuff is more it's better quality. Oh, yeah, and in Japan they don't sell fake So it's a crime, right? So I give it to her. She loves it. She's like, you don't have to. But I understand, and she understands, I understand the work that she's actually helping me. Now, it's not because Dr.
01:13:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E told her, but because I've been talking to her, I said, this kind of love you. You really are, I'm not telling you this because we were together. You're really just that level boy. You're, hate, I love emotions, but I hate them because physically, they're overwhelming in my body. Like, I feel it everywhere. But, Chona, you, you're not, you're not common, you're rare in everything. And you, you're the kind of person with the love and the light that you have, that people are going to want to have around them. And even when it's professionally, they're still, they're going to be like, I want to do good for her because you're doing good for them.
01:13:59 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, I'm going to keep happening, except for there are just some bad people that you don't want to, okay. Yeah, I know they are. And again, like I came from before I left for Japan, I gave them like, you know, just little things. And I obviously, because I love Hermes, and it helps my chance of getting a bag.
01:14:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if I will talk about that some other time that time.
01:14:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But I gave them like small perfume, like eat all of them, not because I see how they work. I see how I'm just very given. think Marc and I are interested because these are stuff for sharing, like we are blessed, like it's okay to like be generous.
01:14:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I didn't have point of having it. It's like karma and everything.
01:14:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then on that day that I got into an accident, actually, I have Christmas gifts with me. I don't know if you know this, I got into accident, right? You know this, right?
01:14:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if you know.
01:14:58 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Wait, before we went before we left for Japan. Did I not tell you before I left for Japan like a couple that week same week I fell in front of a I still have a slip and fall in front of a Starbucks two days later I have an accident it for my previous my daily driver I really love and it's still in the bar to shop and then Mark made a comment like isn't it coming threes and then you get the the theft and then I did the theft here so I said this has to be it like it's that's it it's I'm done and then just good things have to happen. But here's the thing you you didn't let it break you like Mark was worried about you because he said this is the stuff that you work for but I did no I was I don't want to cry because I think I'm the first one on the scene and I was so scared I was tired. I have a flashback of what happened when I was child. I didn't tell my mom because she's gonna be, she's not gonna help me.
01:16:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like she's just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be worried about her and her heart. I don't want to bring to her in the hospital.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is like three years of hard work and wins and losses. Like freaking Hermes game really caught me on the, it was like wrapped around her finger in terms of, I do love stuff. I do love luxury. I don't want this to deter me from loving what I like and living in theater. Lessons learned, know, being more, I guess we are very definitely nonchalant with stuff. We don't have bolts. don't have, my stuff is around. My mom told me, even my friends told me like, you guys have people in your house. Like we have the PA, we have the chef, like cleaners comic. We're very open. I guess it's just in life. That's how we are. We're very open to giving anything our own expertise Whatever we just give and I even question mark is this is my fault that I did this problem.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, am I being um, no, no tona It's a gift for you to know that that is not that stuff doesn't define you you can love it But it's not what's most important to you. Do you remember when you told me that you were worried, um You were kind of doubting yourself because like you were feeling bad about your financial goals And I think it was a rather time that you talked with your friends about, you know What you wanted to do and they're like, yeah, okay. Yeah, it was before it was before then and you were like You were you didn't want to be? Superficial or just about the money and then the next week you came and you told me about your hospital patients And you were just like so actually I think it was right out After that in the same conversation either way it was really recent and you were telling me how much you love them and how much love you and how much you want to take care of them. If nothing else this was just a gift for you to know that you can that part of the joy is not just that having them and having them be you know in in the closet most the time you're not seeing them all anyway you're not gonna wear them all all those things but it's that you can have them and and you get to enjoy them and you can go make more whoever took them from you they can't do that without stealing it from people you could just make it and then you make it and you give it so the gift is knowing that nobody can take anything really from you they can take the stuff you can get more stuff and if they had memories attached to them if they had meaning the memories stay with them the meaning stays with you the physical item leaves sometimes our families as a way, but their memories and the things that they give us, they don't pass away, right? They're taking from us.
01:19:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, I was, I'm definitely, you know, I, I was meditating a little outside, but I noticed I'm very jumpy. I want to lock the doors, like I'm here, I got, I locked doors, I don't just come and tell me, but I noticed that I'm very jumpy and I'm on edge, but I'm looking at the positive, I'm trying, I'm not positive, yes, positive, but being objective about it, and not disregarding my process on it's a gloss, it's a grieve of losing stuff, and it's a fear of violating our privacy and our safety with the, I don't know if Mark should do that.
01:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He did. The one thing I would say, and I'm, I'm a grounded person. to and but I also so I believe in being prepared but my guns are right there in a safe I've got like five of them and my girls have all got shooting I have security cameras we lock everything but what's meant to be is gonna be when it's my time God's in charge of that nobody else but I do believe in being prepared but statistically people can come back to places they've been to if it's not a lot of resistance so you may consider upgrading your security but still be peaceful I don't mean be afraid I just be prepared for the statistics maybe if you don't have security cameras just put them up security cameras are one of the best deterrents and they'll walk away that's right now again because of the neighborhood even our neighborhood they don't also have no one I think there's people that have
01:21:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
but there's no security individually, but because of this, now they're gonna, everyone is on edge around us and I call like, our neighbor across the street who have guns and they're across the street. I really like that. For some reason, I remember calling Mark because I'm the first one in there and then I call 911. I don't recall entirely the conversation 911, but I went outside because I feel safe inside and I call our neighbor and then they they like running right. I didn't even tell them what the problem is, but Keeson was like, Jonah never calls because Mark and him talk all the time, but I never called him.
01:21:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
knew you needed something.
01:21:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And so he's like, something went wrong. So him and his wife, they have a baby. They finally left their baby with their brother that's they're in the house, thankfully, so they have family with them. So they left the baby with them, toddler. And then they came to watch both of them and then mark came 20 minutes later, but they're with me in the house So I feel very grateful. That's why we love and it was we love that neighborhood That's why we don't want it to be and he's like I've been here for 25 years. I this is never happened like in the crime like There's a crazy son who killed his family and then the house was sold in at a lower price But that's he like that's That really is there's nothing like this that happened to us.
01:22:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So everyone is on edge too right now But this into is that sometimes that can bring communities together and Maybe you guys needed it for something else. There's there's so many things that we just don't even know But you did nothing wrong The there's no punishment you are doing amazing wonderful good thing as much as they There's real light and real good and God. There is an enemy and an adversary to that as well, and he's busy on his work. And, and so it doesn't mean anything. You just keep surrounding yourself with good people, keep loving them, keep supporting them. You're very good at giving as much, if not more than what you get, you're going to do amazing things. Keep thinking about this, like definitely go to Ted and say, look, this is what I need. Do you guys do this? Can you create this for me? If not, can I pay you to do it? If not, can you tell me who I can pay to do this for me? If not, we will find somebody to do it or we will sit on a call and do it together. But it's really going to make that big of a difference. These types of systems, they prevent errors.
01:23:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because I'm worried I'm going to have errors on date of birth because I'm just copy-pacing it or memorizing it and then putting it in.
01:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They prevent errors not just on your side and not even for just for the patient because now you're looking and making sure you're asking all these questions. It helps prevent errors on the attorney side like these types of systems are really important and they're worth all the work to get. So but you're the one bringing it to the table and that's you know part of your value so remember that.
01:24:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And yeah I'm very I'm on top of it like if a patient says oh my accident is 12 there's multiple occasions but there's there's a particular occasion situation I just want to tell you real quick. Patient said oh I had my accident was on the 8th of December but I didn't go to the Kaiser until the 12th and then on the attorney side the date of the accident is the 12th. So I told them I don't want to record something until I talk to you first. I said this is what the patient told me. and they verify it on their records like, yeah, oh, they're very thankful. Yeah, thank you for telling me this. That's why, that's why there's certain lingo that Mark told me that I have to write, being involved in a motor vehicle accident on or about. Yeah, it's not like on like, but like, you know, those things. Yeah, I'm very, very grateful or I think Mark right now is on a mode of, he was not being, he's tired that he's like on, I don't know what's the term, but he's on a work mode in a way. He's just, and surprisingly, we are calm Mark. We have dinner here at midnight. have, we cheers on a Sprite.
01:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
01:25:57 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And then we have a, he bought some, you know, the popper. He was actually in the grocery when I called him that something happened, so he came right away, but he got poppers for a few years. And then we both agreed that we're going to get through this. We are very blessed and we're grateful for that. could have been a work second.
01:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:26:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Can't imagine, you know, happened to him. Because I'm the one that is leaving.
01:26:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's not.
01:26:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah. He just randomly decided he's going to leave too. So that's why we don't know how random is this.
01:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if he didn't leave? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like you were watched over.
01:26:43 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, I believe that too.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You both do so much good. Like Mark, Mark has been very good for me, for my family, and been a blessing for me and to be able to get to see now I'm going to cry to get to work with you.
01:27:06 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm very excited and I'm very grateful when he told me that I was like, I'm very excited. And then you're a woman. know he has, I think that anyway, the point is like, it's a woman and I'm going to be able to connect better.
01:27:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I don't get to work with women because most women aren't making enough money to pay my prices. And if they are, they're really kind of underground, like we work underground, like, you know, and the ones that are not, they're not kind of thing and like, oh, like, attention that, like, I I don't like being , but not for the girls, you know, for my guy, for like my little inner circle kind of thing, you know.
01:28:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
This is my daily outfit, I'd rather, I know I love luxury stuff, they're freaking...
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'll also go climb a tree still. I was the tomboy, I love my nails, I love everything, so much, but I will put my own worm on my hook, it's still gross, but I will do it because I want to know that like I earned it all, and yeah, so I'm not, you know, for everybody. And anyway, in my industry, there's just not a lot, so getting to work with you is because your woman by itself is really special, but because it's you, Tona, you really, really, really are very unique. Your sweetness and your smartness and your tenacity, that is an incredibly unique, rare package. I know I'm one of those types of people and I get that feedback. I know from people how rare I am and that's how you are. so the fact that I got to work with you, like I'm just over the moon with it. So if you need anything, I'm here for you.
01:29:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Thank you. Well, you already are. I that's why I said this meeting had to happen because life and this is like my anchor and I'm just hanging in on this one because and then they texted me to today, the staff. They're very nice to share your and Dr. Ease. Like, do you want us to take away or tell the medicine tomorrow? I was like, no, I thought about it. It's like, no, I just have to keep on going.
01:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, these are my, you don't want to lose momentum.
01:29:48 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
That's what will kill you.
01:29:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes.
01:29:51 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yes. That's what I'm worried about yesterday because I know who my old me was. My old me was. There's a term I tell Marcus, you know, like when I, I'm in the mud, when I'm very depressed, I, and I'm in the mud, I get, and then after some time, I like being there. And it will be very difficult for me to get out of it, because it becomes comfortable. And I don't want to, to, I've experienced it, recently when my dad passed away. And I know how it felt. I don't, I refuse to be in that place again.
01:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's part of what I lift weights. I am COVID, like I thought all I wanted to do was have all the free time I wanted and all the money to do whatever I wanted to do. And then COVID came and that's what I had lots of money and lots of free time. And my spirit just died. And also, I, my body shape change, I atrophy, and I did not know how much muscle I lost. so for the last year, I've been being really, really heavy weights. only go like two to four times a month. I don't go often because I actually get weaker if I go too much. My shape has changed, especially the back side.
01:31:12 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
really like that. I can't tell the boys these things. can tell. I can't wait. I don't, in general, I do, I did write on my, my journal today. And, you know, I just try to meditate a little bit and just things that I want to do for myself. And I know going back to the house, it definitely is painful, but like, it's a process. I'm not going to bypass the grief feeling, the grief process. I'm not going to buy five seconds. Also, it's not normal. don't know. thing. But I am focusing on what I can control what I can focus on, which is this is one big one.
01:32:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So we should also, next week or sometime soon, I would love to know like how do you take care of yourself? Like what are you doing? Do you have?
01:32:24 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I don't do anything.
01:32:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A nutritionist and a trainer.
01:32:28 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm telling you.
01:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Those things change my life. How I ate and how I moved. And but so many people are going home and they go obsessive and they do.
01:32:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I'm so proud of Mark. Like you met him two years ago. I am so proud of how he thank care of himself and oh gosh, it's like almost 12 years now. When I first met him, he doesn't like to take care of himself. Like I feel like I have to nag him to go to his doctor and stuff. but now he's and it's so it's so good. So yeah, I need to basically practice why I preach. I need talk. Yeah, I mean, I want to do those NAD stuff too.
01:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I it's like, oh, yeah.
01:33:17 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
are all the stuff I know, but I don't.
01:33:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. For me, like eating dairy, I eat dairy, I'm like hung over the next day. But I found enzymes and probiotics. Yeah. And then, um, curcuminant.
01:33:44 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Do I could tell you? okay. I know. Like, because I have, I told you about that, the autoimmune and I need to, I even write it in my notes. It's like, I need a physical exam and blood to work.
01:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have not done that. Yes. Okay, so make a goal like write down your goals and tell me I can be accountable with you and help you but also so I can help you because you can't if you try to do all the things at once it's going to help you so you want to prioritize like what is the thing that's going to give you the most benefit first and then start stacking all the other things that kind of like make that foundation solid but you want to start with the thing that gives you the most the feeling that you can feel the change the most first I think I need to be consistent with my schedule then I pick I get a hold of that then I can do okay so actually but here's the thing I'm gonna tell you it's harder to be consistent with your schedule when you're not consistent with your diet because your diet will screw up your schedule and so if you start with your diet and energy first your schedule will become easier that's what i'm talking about like send me all your Because I'll tell you, if you do them out of order, or if you do them in the right order, each one will become easier to attain when you choose the right one first.
01:35:11 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Right. I do fast before, I do daily fast, like I do intermittent, like I do intermittent fasting, but I did a long fast before but it's more of spiritual to that when I was, you know, leaving and after that fast I feel much better. Obviously, I did lost weight and my blood word is amazing. The doctors, like what did you do? I said fast. This is like obviously lost weight. before I try this patient, the joints is better with your lighter.
01:35:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:35:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
alcohol, once in a while, I would, but that definitely flared me up. Yeah. In the nightshades, nightshades. Oh yeah, which is very good in gluten, which is very good, but I, I don't know, that's gonna be very hard to to change.
01:36:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, we, uh, it's already been like way over, um, but we got lots of week when you're talking to, we'll just keep talking through all of it and you don't have to wait through the week. We're gonna talk about all those.
01:36:25 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)

01:36:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, will that type work for you?
01:36:30 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yes, yes. What time do you, um, are you okay with the 11 12 at that time to start on the 8th?
01:36:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Let me, um, I, I will move it as soon as I get up phone with you.
01:36:46 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have to make some other calendar changes also.
01:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:36:50 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So, actually, I would love to see before I leave on 9. If that's not happening, I think we should continue.
01:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, at the very least, we can do voice messages because there's no good, I think.
01:37:07 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah, no, it definitely definitely helps. Okay, so I need to change the setting. Will you help me? So I don't lose, because I was worried that I'm going to lose the, what do you call that? I was worried that I'm going to lose your voice message.
01:37:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or I, that you won't leave my voice message. don't know because I did it like ages ago, but I think is it per message thing? Yeah. So it's just an all time setting. It's so weird. They've changed everything so much in this latest update. And I don't even know how to navigate everything yet. Hold on.
01:38:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
If I did this on my, my friends and it's like gone, they didn't hear my message because it's up to their setting, I guess.
01:38:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, yeah, it is for the device. So like, if you don't want to lose your messages, you can't control it, but you can't control other people's messages. Okay, so in settings, you have to go to apps. What OS do you have now?
01:38:29 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Do you have the latest? I have the latest, I think. What is the latest? About 18.1.1.
01:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, do it. Hold on. Okay. Oh, it is. Okay. So you go to settings, you go to apps, then you go to messages.
01:38:49 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oops.
01:38:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is all the way down at the bottom.
01:38:53 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Uh, Let me tell them I don't see apps. So settings and. then go to apps, okay, and then miss again.
01:39:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
way down the messages, yeah. Okay, and then all the way down at the bottom, they'll say audio messages.
01:39:22 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Um, audio messages, uh-huh.
01:39:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then expire and mine is set to never.
01:39:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Okay, okay, I just changed it.
01:39:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. You're welcome.
01:39:32 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
And I was so worried. I'm like, oh my god, it's gone.
01:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
much space do you have on your phone?
01:39:38 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Because I have like a terabyte. Oh, I don't know if I have that much. Mark got me, um, is it about?
01:39:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, iPhone storage or? Yeah.
01:39:52 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
I have have 256 gigabytes.
01:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so you have like 25% of what I So, how much, how much have you used?
01:40:04 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Well, it says I have available any more.
01:40:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, well, I don't think it can be changed, right? Well, you can get rid of things, but I don't know if you can see.
01:40:19 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Oh, I can see which ones. Yeah, the applications is 240. I don't know if this is correct. The photos is a lot. The photos is 39,500.
01:40:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to go clear a bunch of things because I'm using a 860 gigabytes on my phone.
01:40:39 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But any of them, you have so much.
01:40:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you add phone?
01:40:45 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah. can we get that?
01:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have one terabyte ones now. And I use it and I keep lots of stuff.
01:41:00 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
um anyway yeah thank you now yeah but what I want to tell you is now that you've done that your messages can like my messages take up only almost two gigs and also gonna be videos and audio so what I've been doing is I thought I'm gonna lose your message too so what I've been doing actually is I've been sending your message to myself too so now I don't have to do them let's watch message I love that I love that okay all right you feel better yeah I know Mark is like texting me I know that you know he's worried about me and I'll be okay thank you know it's a process and I just don't want to love to have and to lose the love of this stuff Because I do love it. We love it.
01:42:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We love the game. Yes. Yes. Don't know Things are gonna happen and they'll happen to everything.
01:42:10 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
So don't let yourself change it because it was Stuff right versus a person versus whatever, you know, and and also remember that that you love it But you don't love it more than As I was looking at mark like if something happened to him and they took a stop, but I wouldn't Probably, you know forgive myself. I will think that it's because of me loving those stuff. That's why something happened to him Like I yeah, so I'm just to have I'm just definitely glad that we're together. I can't imagine We have a great time too in Japan So we always like do uh the business classes it's it's fine we don't need the first classes it's the first no not the first because some first class looks like business class too so it's right but the first time that we have the Singapore Air Force class and it's really good and we feel rejuvenated with some little whole sweeping pause and things like that we feel like oh gosh like I need to work harder so that way if for example also mark is not here I can do this for my own family like I want them to like experience this yeah like that's exactly already what I was like I need to work hard because you want to give it to other people but the energy of having your own is what gives you the energy to go create it for other people so that's really important to understand and that's okay God said that we can have all the things that we want to as long as we want to bless other people with it you know what I just realized that This is actually the year that I have given so much to others, like in kind, whether you're only going to keep giving more money and everything. This is also the time that we got lost, you know, the most in terms of stuff.
01:44:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. when I told you about yin and yang?
01:44:20 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
Yeah.
01:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they always, always will balance each other out. And this is why a lot of people play really small, because they don't want those big feelings. They're afraid of the big good and they're afraid of the big bad. So you just have to know that if you get that great good, you will have the great bad. It does balance it out, but it won't feel like it's more except for in the tiny moments when it happens. So you just have to let it pass through and understand that that is universal, that is that is spiritual, that is divine, that is bigger than us, has nothing to do. with you earning anything bad, good and bad, and dark, equal opposites and all things for eternity. But you do so much great good. me, I always feel like it's worth the bad. But also, the bad is not just bad. It teaches me something.
01:45:23 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
It leaves a gift behind.
01:45:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it thinks that it can break me.
01:45:27 - Chona Sweet ( wspainclinic)
But what it does is makes me stronger. Yeah, I definitely feel there's moments, but I mean, I don't need to talk to you like right now. Like, or Dr. E is like, you don't need to see patients tomorrow. Like, no, I and what I meant is I know you wouldn't understand. Like, people don't understand. But it's like, no, I can't. I have to keep moving.
01:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's why I know that you're going to be okay, no matter what happens.

It's just hanging over my painting that I have back there. You know, I still remember, um, uh, I never had to make my compass. I'm going to go up and put my water on. I boil the water on. I still remember, um, Busher Azar.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? I.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

She's very bold away. She markets.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah For second anyway She used to when she first started she used to use colorful Shower curtain she bought from Amazon and have it behind her, but it worked and no one would know it was a shower curtain and you know because she's All about bold colors. It was like all like multicolored bold stuff. Anyways, it was it was funny that she just used a shower curtain I used to use My ex has been being a photographer. Well, his hobby was that he was Yeah, like those Pippers you could buy from the photography store and you just you can oh, yeah Pack it up to the top of your your wall and and it just rolls down and it's flat So that was kind of cool because you get so many colors, right?
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah Yeah I'm so sleepy. was up till like one o'clock talking to my sister and then Is she had to get up at four o'clock? So that really sucks for her. And then we got up at $5.50 to take my daughter to seminary and have been up ever since.
00:02:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how far away is the drive to the seminary?
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's three minutes. She starts at six o'clock. So we just zoomed out the door. Maybe I got up like $5.40 something, but yeah, I'm tired.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you got a lot done.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Congratulations. Yeah, but I hate all of it.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So bad. What do you mean, it all would talk to me?
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hate looking at myself. I have listening and I just cringe and I think I need to throw it all away. Oh, my God.
00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I feel every time I make something like that.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like, how can I do this without video?
00:02:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just, it's terrible, but you deliver pure gold.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but one thing that I did, I was being prayerful about it yesterday and trying to think because So everything that I do is as leveraged as it can be and price point has a lot to do with it. It's its own kind of filtration system but also a leverage in a different way. So I was thinking like, I was thinking about a lot of things. First of all, I don't like Facebook. That's where I've been for the longest time.
00:03:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have some really amazing connections and followers.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also, and I did mention this stuff to you.
00:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've asked you that.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did.
00:03:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I I answered it just now. Yeah. I think Stan's door. I've looked at it and I think it's smart. And I also think diversifying is the way to go because I posted that first YouTube video on Saturday morning. And we'll maybe about 11 by the time posted. It took a long time for the first post because I had to do all my channel optimization and keywords and new banner and all that stuff. I've been an old 15 year old account and, you know, because I've been buying, you know, some other people's YouTube courses and stuff. What is interesting about now versus even a couple years ago, YouTube is now rewarding by video, not by channel. So before, you know, you thought you have to have this perfect channel and everything's all connected, everything, but no, now it's more like by video, get one really good video that gets lot ton of views and who cares about the other videos. So that's why I want my old channel. Anyway, you wouldn't believe it. Even the guys like, I can't believe your numbers, 90% or more is all organic coming from YouTube recommended. That's how they're finding me. But the videos got over 570 views now and I got Saturday morning, wow. And the stats, I've never ever even looked at the stats. If you ever want me to share a screen and I'll show you YouTube stats, the stats are really good at showing, like it shows you the traffic. Like I thought, okay, from my warm eyes. Facebook or I send an email out about it. No, because it shows like I only got about 20 clicks from my email because I just have a small list of 750 people. And so it actually shows like direct traffic was like 29, know, people or whatever. So it shows that level, but it shows everything else is coming from YouTube suggested. And then when I look, when people join my school, new school community, I have an auto DM because school has that feature was pretty cool. Right. And I want to confuse you because you're going go high level community. So get that out of your mind. But I then asked I'm curious, just wondering how, you know, why you joined, right? And, and some of the people that started answering since I put up the YouTube video on Saturday, said, Oh, well, the YouTube suggested you on on YouTube. Yeah. So they found me through YouTube. And they became a member, you know, and I haven't launched anything yet to them. So they also became, can we come a buyer? And then they said, I just liked your style. You're just so authentic. and inspiring.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I thought that was really cool too. Yeah, that is awesome. Yeah, I that feels like the thing that I needed to hear, but also it's what I've been watching and it's what I've been doing. Like I am connecting with people that like connecting emotionally listening to the stories and going, you don't have even a quarter of the experience that I have, but what I appreciate you is you're out here talking and you have a real story and you're learning and you're learning faster because you've got way more resources than I ever had, but that makes me happy though, because I can see what's available to other people and like, you know what I mean, like there's all these different types of value people have. And yeah, and I love the diversity, not just of the platforms, but of the people. Like I like learning from lots of different people and that's an opportunity we didn't have before. So that means that we can be that another voice. We don't have to be that a voice. I think in the iron world everybody wants to be the voice and the teacher and the guru and the coach Whereas I don't need to be your everything. I can't just be a part of it And especially if I'm affordable enough for you to be able to get some of everyone That's you're making my brain guys.
00:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So in a I'm gonna stay in bed and and read a bit Because the YouTube channel I then do a lot of research right to go okay You know the statistically you look at someone that has certain subscribers that they have some certain videos that have way more Views of the subscriber count that you know That's a good video and he's got a topic that I also teach on and do so okay Let's model after some of this but using my authentic voice But so one guy that I've been following a bit is Dan Co.
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, for her to say have.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so he teaches about being a solopreneur, right? And it's kind of cool. I like his style and stuff. But what was interesting is that he's really big on one of his low ticket products. I think it's low ticket. I didn't click to see the price is two hour writing. So the concept is just, you know, if you can write for two hours a day, you can create a solopreneur digital, you know, income, you know, passive, almost passive income empire doing what you love if you like to write. But he's big on Twitter. So and I don't know if you're seeing a trend on this by any chance. But one of the guys that hired me for a consult call two months ago just shocked the heck out of me because he actually says he's making 50,000 a month selling is I think his high ticket products $5,000. So he has a book to call Donald. But all of his traffic is organic Twitter. That's it. Yes. And I'll. What? And he was referring to me because the guy that does the sales calls is bought some of my products and said, I think this guy needs to hire you to also make a low ticket funnel for Facebook ads. But either way, YouTube got to connect. He's got to hire you for a strategy call. So that's how we connected. But I was just like, wait, you're getting all of your traffic from Twitter. He goes, yeah, I started writing all the posts myself. And then now I hired a ghostwriter to do my tweets and all that stuff.
00:09:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And no video.
00:09:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's a book of call funnel. So it goes, no video can solve writing, right? But when you click the book, a call, it goes to a video sales letter of him saying, Hey, you know, I can help you. I honestly forget. Oh, he teaches people how to publish a book on Amazon. That's it. So the hey, like, I can help you publish book on Amazon and, you know, the typical 90 days or less or something. And so he goes through how much money you can make a typical video sales letter, and then book a call. And he's got that other guy doing sales calls. he's really a good example of leveraging, right? Obviously, he probably did it all himself at first, but then he leveraged. And there's other people now teaching people to become Twitter ghostwriters. it's our acts, I should say. So, there's something about that. And even I'm going to revive my Twitter account. I've revived my YouTube account, so I'm like, what's October? I always like to have each month a new money-making activity I'm going to try, like something different. So, October is going to be Twitter.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I, you know what would be great is because we have such similar and parallel paths, not necessarily, right?
00:10:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're marketing.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like I'm overall business, still, like the experience, also the level of work that we'll do in the organization and the structure, but I think it would be cool if we just kind of like dip our toe in the same things, okay? So, and make some like mini goals of what would you do like? So, maybe like a content schedule. I don't know how much you use chat GPT, but I love to use that for a lot of things, for planning, for ripping, for feedback, for research, whatever. what if, so, I'm going back a little bit because in the beginning, I feel like you were looking for your compass. How do you feel, where do you feel like you're at on that journey?
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like you've definitely been your fire stoked.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you feel like you have, how much clarity do you feel like you have in your direction, in your purpose, in, have you set any kind of specific goals yet? think, I think it starts there. I think the bigger vision is having clarity of purpose so clear that goals automatically form themselves and they're in alignment. And it isn't ever, I think when you get really clear, it's not a destination goal ever anymore. It is a progress goal. It is a this is who I am. So my goal is to continue to improve who I am and enjoy the magic on the way. Yeah, I don't I have some specific goals, but they kind of just help me formulate a path, but they aren't end goals. They are process and progress goals, right? being able to, my mom and have have a very difficult, strange relationship, but she wants to be able to travel and have a travel van as like $50,000, whatever. I want to buy that for her or have a place where she can live with one of her kids. I'm going to be traveling. So I'm not going to have a place where she can just live with me. Yeah. I want to take care of her. I want to have a couple of rental properties, know, like I want to have investments where money is working for me. I want to continue my education forever. Like I want to stay in school pretty much forever, getting different degrees and things not for any purpose other than my own learning. I want to always be serving a mission or in service work of some sorts. And in order to do all of that, I have to be able to have some income generating activities. But I also love teaching so I always to be teaching. Those aren't specific end goals. I need to be making roughly 25. My goal is $50,000 a month because of how much taxes you get in a whole new tax bracket because I pay 10% tithing and I pay my tithing off the top. I do not pay it after taxes and expenses.
00:13:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just off my gross.
00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that amount of money means I never have to think about anything and there's tons of wiggle room for. all the people I want to hire, all those things, right?
00:14:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, within that space, I want to stay within the topics of talking about God and talking about business.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I don't, there is no more specificity than that. Now, until I go, okay, well, how does that happen? And then I've got my hourly clients. I want to have hybrid coaching. I want to have a product that just is basically their for lead gen, but also kind of nurturing people up and ascending them as they learn and they grow. And that's also my teaching outlet, my creative outlet, and my service outlet. So, it serves the money goals.
00:14:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It serves the service goals.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it has the compounding effect because as my platform increases and followers increases, that means my buying market increases, my ability to generate money off of what I already have increased. And so anyway, that's, that's my thing to me, uh, if you have a version of that where all the things feed all the things with a compounding power, that's the goal, the specificity comes in the topics and the leverage. So like the offers and things like that. As we've been going, you've been dialing into different things, but you also have a goal I just learned of trying something new and marketing every month. Yes. So what kind of thoughts, how have your thoughts evolved and all of that?
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. think, um, uh, the high level answers that haven't set down all the goals yet, but the detailed answer is. I knew the process would get me there, like I needed to get the momentum. And I feel I've got that now and I, um, sometimes get pulled. back, but not nearly as much anymore about , you know, some cost fallacy about all the assets I created for Krita and systems. But I feel so free. I love your right, like I love teaching, you know, almost, you know, became a prof, you know, did my PhD way back when, because I know I love teaching. So I sort of in my element, and I also reflected on, you know, because you said, Hey, you know, think about all your past and stuff, and you know, when I'm happy. Well, it was when I was in flow. And when I'm in flow, it's when I'm creating. So like, if I look at when I was making like millions, even sometimes million per month, you know, back between, you know, the heyday was in 2005 and 2012, probably. I was publishing a lot. I wasn't really behind the scenes ever being like 50 50 partner with a Korean doing so much stuff, you know, so being like a mechanic, you know, with launching all the funnels and stuff. But I was publishing a lot and most of like 80% of the revenue came from the digital offers because I was launching one one every month, practically. So I had like 25,000 paid customers, you know, within the four year period. Yeah. So, and then I'd make lot of money, affiliate marketing, because I love Jason Bladoon. He's a good friend of mine. And so if he was promoting building something as before, he was as famous as he is now, but he always had great product. So I would always promote and he's great at selling and converting on webinars. So I would make, I was his top affiliate for the longest time, year after year, and they paid 20,000 passively from that. So at that time, also gave, when nano cast came out, do you remember nano cast? Yeah. he gave out, you know, lifetime commissions once someone became a customer. So recurring revenue.
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is that his?
00:17:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, but he used that platform.
00:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:17:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I didn't think it was that bad. No, no, we were using that platform. We switched from infusion software to there. And I was his first affiliate on nanocast and I use nanocast back in the day. So anyways, so I went, wow, that's it. Like I was in flow. And then yeah, sometimes I did coaching. Yeah, I remember having some fun weekends where people would fly up to my house and I'd teach them how to do a video Everyone still sucks at video. So I'd have like small groups for $3,000 I'd have like ten people five to ten people come out to my house and you're staying hotel, but each day we're in the house and we go for walks by the lake all the time and We're gonna do videos You're you're gonna walk away But the end of three days with some marketing videos for you your business, right? you're gonna be comfortable on video and it was fun and and so, yeah, I My best products back then was about teaching people consulting how to like the ultimate consulting challenge I saw in that domain and then I sold little $97 products So here's these consulting contracts when you get a client all this stuff. Oh, Yeah, so so I was kind of thinking hmm. I could easily relaunch that and tie that into recurring revenue go high level, right? Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. so build a community So this is step one because the digital offer community is is good And that's what I love too, but I've got Sally as my right-hand woman who could easily take that over when I then go Then to the ultimate consulting route, right? She becomes then kind of the chief operating officer if we will of that community And I'm talking a year out or something not like right now. Oh, I've got her plug in my phone. I'm my Computer hold on so or or, know, like you and I also you have that community I was just gonna talk. Yeah, me and and you know the only way to talk about that is We bring up the Google Doc and we you explain it to me and all that stuff. So that's there But yeah, so so but the other thought was the ultimate consulting challenge Did you people how to become a consultant and whether that be like a coach or whether that be like hangout and get local businesses for 500 bucks a month? And everything I teach will never be I'm even though I used to be like this. Oh I'm gonna make million dollars. I'm gonna teach you how to make, know, you know, tons of big money I want to just go here's how to make an extra $3,000 profit put a month. Here's not here's not make extra 500 month because I want to go after I'm still want to go after even though I'm not going to say just woman because 70% of my revenue come from men actually.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:20:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. But people in their 40s and 50s, right? Who I want to help.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I so what I would love to do as we're both kind of direting in and stuff and and realizing that I really I really think that I and I think it's true for both of us but I really know that it would be true for me that I will go faster spending more time talking and working with you. I think that I'll stay more focused. You are working on high-level strategy and you're working every day. Yeah. Whatever. Making traction every week. Whether it's a day thing, know, you've got mom, I've got kids.
00:20:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's there's some days that are just like and some days that are like this, right?
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but especially because we both have magnetic personalities, but the emotions and authentic desire to serve people and protect them from the predatory all marketing world. I think I know that this happens for me but I think that it probably happens for you too where you just feel sincere real love for people you don't even know you just come across and you're like I just want to see you win yeah I want you to be happy like all you have to do is see their face read their story, they say something to you and you immediately feel this, mama bear love and just like you need to win. I want you to win. Come to me, yes, I'm charging money, but I want you to win and I really care about you. That doesn't exist a lot proportionately. There are more and more of those, but proportionately it's not small. But add to it, you know, our decade of experience in the marketing world. Add to it that I imagine you've never sold yourself out for your money. I haven't. That doesn't mean that there aren't times where I feel like I have definitely been taken advantage of.
00:22:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've made people a lot of money.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, you know, as a woman, meaning using feminine assets in a way, like there's a lot that we have to offer that. and others don't who have, and it's not about judging them, it's about helping protect people against feeling they've got to do things that make them uncomfortable in order to earn money or to be successful. So I would love to, like you talked about Twitter, I would love coming up with Hey, let's just say, let's encourage each other to put out X amount of content on Twitter, can be repurposed anywhere else. Writing, but I would love to create a plan of a community that we build and we feed together. I don't care if it's just women. I want to serve women with a particular way, but I don't need to serve just women. There are plenty of men who don't fit in that alpha male, who don't want to be, and they don't want to be called feminine, so they don't want to come into women's community, but they do, because that's where they feel safest. And because it hurts my heart so much that men are like, you know, like girly men or like I was a tomboy, my sister was like a tomboy and I'm like, I hate it when somebody tells me I'm in masculine energy, I get used for you, mama bear energy is not masculine. Yeah, yeah, mama bear like my wanting to go to battle and at all costs, I said, that's them and that's a mother right there. That's feminine. Anyway, but I feel like spending strategic time on the same type of things that we can then go duplicate that process out to our other businesses. So actually starting with the stuff that we do together and they go, okay, this is working with us let's go. So Maria goes and does the same thing, a Maria world and Tina does the same thing which yours is marketing, right, mine is business together. We're marketing and business and The mamas and like I mean like that could even be them. I'm a bear marketing. Oh my gosh Mama bear marketing. like that. That would be amazing. I think I've never thought of that before but yeah Actually, like that. Well, they're marketing with Maria and Tina.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Because like right now my goal process goals are like launched to Long-form content meaning between five and twelve minute videos on YouTube a week Include two shorts a week actually just one short is fine And then now you know that the Twitter things there. I'm like hmm. I know it's worked over, but I'm willing to start earlier because Yeah, did you ever have an old Twitter account?
00:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd never did anything with Twitter. I have it And but I never God, I worry, never read about followers. My LinkedIn is huge. Well, huge for me. It's like $6,000. But I've always kept my connections minimal.
00:26:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is, and I used to teach this, and I need to make video around this too, um, publish wants or sort of create once publish everywhere, which is yeah, too, right? so like what I liked about reading Dan Coe's page, about stuff is that his, um, two hour, um, you know, whatever product system he talks about how for him, he writes, that's his skills. But then he puts on Twitter and then he does a YouTube video just saying what he wrote, right? And then apparently this works. Um, and then he, um, actually, let me just share screen and take a look at that. said apparently it works. He goes and, um, then puts the tweet on Instagram and he, He now has a huge Instagram following, right?
00:27:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's his two hour writer, right?
00:27:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's very simple. like, like, I like his, I like his vibe. Work less than one. Yeah, very nice. Join the new 1% and talks a lot about the solopreneur, right? The art of focus, one person business, talks a lot about that. Then this, the two hour writers went intrigued me.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I thought it was pretty reasonable because I think one of sounds like he has been studying my guy a lot. It's just the second brain. Like, I'd be interested if he followed Dexter at all.
00:27:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So then if you go look up and never actually look at his Instagram, but all he said is he just reposts the tweet to Instagram. And then that's really increased.
00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. Do you know who Dexter Abraham is?
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, is that your guy?
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my fiance, like 10 years, but I don't know, okay. He has my note taking nerd was an old thing.
00:27:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's pretty much abandoned that now.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, he did a lot about writing. He used to take notes at all of the major events and sold it. Like I'm talking like 15 years ago.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he started that.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like Tim Castleman doesn't now, Tim. Yes, I'm talking Tim Castleman, selling the notes to funnel hacking live or something. Yeah. Yeah, when he used to sell him from Tropic Incinversals too. But yeah, Dexter always talks about your second brain and he taught about Evernote as his second brain.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And yeah, but is he using notion?
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, or is he still use Evernote? Evernote is his second brain. he's got books and books and books stored there out of his own stuff. He's an amazing writer. Yeah. Oh, wow.
00:28:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so. I think like this, I think it's just a tweet he probably did, right? you know, so he's just doing this like like 13,000 likes. But yeah, that's all it is. It's just this. And then I've never gone to his ex account. But did you know that Google had a Google X before Twitter was an X?
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I just I'm reading a book called Alchemy. And it talked about Google X.
00:29:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, I did not know that. And you said, go ahead, go ahead. Were you reading Alchemy? No, but I do. Totally mismatch and not organized like probably Dexter does. But I use Apple Notes for lot of my notes. Well, like, I woke up this morning and I wasn't really interested to, wasn't really interested to get up.
00:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just thought, Oh, just going to. Yeah, I'm interested in getting onto this because I love it. Don't think we all know.
00:30:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So and I do like to do content stuff for an hour day easily or research, right? a lot of it's by testimonials, right? I was looking at the testimonials to our writer because this is very similar to my micro offer magic course, right? teaching me about a great small micro offer. But so I was taking screenshots of, you know, what she's saying. She's a hypnotist, mine coach to our writer, especially organized assistant art, post your content blog. But anyways, in here, oh, that's for Virginia. No, here's Dan Co. So yeah, so here's more Dan Co. So I even circled some of the stuff on his sales page. You are earning with your time instead of your mind. And I want to build a foundation to reverse that. thought, oh my God, that's so good. But the words alchemy, I did write down here somewhere that structures for social growth came, I think, from a testimonial. I wrote down to bring in, there we go, one of his clients, I went to one of his testimonial clients websites who teaches ancient alchemist principles, and I'm like, I love those words, and I just wrote it down and says that somehow I got to include that and buy stuff because I love teaching, I love, I love alchemy, like remember the, well, are you reading now, alchemy or the actually very reminiscent of a book that I read called Misbehaving by Richard Thaler, who is an economist. Yeah, I've heard of him, actually, yeah.
00:31:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, by Rory Sutherland.
00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:31:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have a call just so you know at 1230. Okay. Yeah, so I, because I offer some, I'm probably stopping or probably just a group on boarding, but I offered people free on what he called when I joined my community. So someone booked for 1230 and it's actually a client. Someone was a client of mine like eight years ago. So you know, you're going to love them.
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a pastor.
00:32:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I helped them make 30,000 a month selling angel bracelets, angel bracelets. So and and also prayers. They have an angel prayer stuff. But yeah, so I helped them. Hey, there's how you do your face. She bought my $1,000 course and she's making 30,000 was making 30,000 a month of it selling that. So they built a beautiful community. She just got sick of shipping them out because I, you know, get high quality stuff.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, hey, design this angel bracelet in China. He didn't teach her how to like hire the people and run them a little tiny business. Well, I did because of that.
00:32:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can't. Yeah. no, no, I told her to because actually I was selling yoga braces and I was using dollar for film and dot com. I said, just ship them to dollar from the film dot com and they only charge you like, whatever. I think I was like, say dollar 50, the ship and pack and you can clue it over it. But for what are reason, they just kept sending it to their house and they were shipping it out. So yeah, I don't know what ended up happening because like, yeah, she's making like 30 thou, I have all these amazing testimonies from her. But I think also they wanted to move towards building Bill's pastor spiritual business, like a little more. So that's why I think they're coming back to me because she already wrote me and said, we want to really go big on our spiritual community now and really leverage what Bill's been teaching and stuff. anyways, that's weird.
00:33:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just thought about that that I didn't even connect the dots with you. So yeah, that's awesome. Okay, I want to make sure that you have time, but also I feel so the only thing that really slows me down literally is making videos. I can write all day long. I can stay focused. But the more that I do video, I think the more I'll get comfortable with it. But but I engage better with actual people. So if I, I can read a script. That's fine. I can do that. I still will hate it. Talking to a camera just drains my soul. It's draining to me. It does not energize me. Talking to people, like if we were to have a community and have calls and report content from there, I would get so much that I could put on a YouTube channel. could do a YouTube channel together. There's so much.
00:34:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We could even do next week have you on as a guest speaker to the new school community. I've gotten talking about time and energy management.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I love serving and teaching. I've done podcasts. I love doing podcasts. I think it's also going to be something that we can serve other people by doing that say like, hey, that solopreneur thing is great until you can't do it on your own and you need to find a partner. Now we've got partner stories, right? I've got bad partner story. You've got maybe you don't want to say bad. Right. Yeah.
00:35:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just structured wrong. So I always got screwed financially, basically.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And so here's the, here's the warning things. Here's the way to go into it and then here's how to protect yourself and that type of thing. Yeah, we can teach people that and being women teaching that and we're not at newbies, you know, we're not spring chickens like some of these young girls coming out here being confident and I'm like, bro, you don't even know like you, you like talking out of the side of your neck excited that you haven't actually been through it yet. Yeah. Wait till you've been through it because experiencing it on a technical level and actually on an emotional level with a person you trusted it whole different thing.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So could you open the Google Doc and just walk me through it so we can just talk about it because we, we have about 20 minutes. that work for you or did you want to achieve anything else on this call? Uh, no.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Um, let me, I just found that. So, hold on, share and answer another question about goals.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, haven't made any big ones, but I did write down two weeks ago, I will make 100 and I have it everywhere on cards everywhere. I will make a hundred thousand dollars by October 19th.
00:36:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. Yep.
00:36:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that.
00:36:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So this doesn't have to be, I do want to have a ladies only event because of the men, like personal in, in person. And so that's where I was starting with this because I was wanting to do the in person thing and I work backwards. So how do I get ladies in person? I built this community that feeds them, but we can still do the ladies only invite and then basically we could funnel if we found male counterparts or you, or, or wanted to just do, um, so we could do ladies only and we could do co- when, right? So that we're serving both parts. Anyway, doesn't even have to be ladies only. It's just the thought. just want to serve women, but I can serve women and men at the same time. And so give that extra protection that women need, but also the men of the same variety would need the same thing. So that's that's good. Anyway, sorry, how to go through that. So primary goal is to gather people with affordable but not basement prices. I want to avoid the people that are looking for diet pills and lottery tickets. That's the language that I use for people who they'll spend a little bit of money, but they want miracles.
00:37:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know effort.
00:37:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically that. Build the list, establish a following on platform, found it on amazing female support, brilliant minds, giving heart. That's a path to upsell for coaching and offers. So when I thought about that, it was you and me creating content together and just talking about the different types of things in business offers is a big, big deal. Understanding how the market research and how to feed the market, you can do all the research you want to. Until you put an offer out, you don't know because you could duplicate somebody else's offer. You can't actually because you're the one promoting it. Your language will be different, your voice will be different, your energy will be different. So basically telling people how to minimum viability, teaching people about minimum viability, teaching them about duplication across networks, all that type of stuff. Anyway, what I would love to see us do is create content that leads people to it could be a free or very low cost community or free community that upsells to, hey, if you want to be on a call with us weekly, do this or if you want the ability to ask us questions, don't know, minimal time, maximum impact in terms of what we share. So you are a vault of knowledge, so am I. We can answer one person's question and it be useful to a thousand people. Yeah. So that's duplication.
00:39:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And now with AI and all the jazz, if we have a right, and this is where your skillset comes into, if we have a right VA in place, you can take what we produce, put it through a certain key or AI and then put it out on tweets, put it out like on Instagram. Obviously, I would probably just record video on YouTube because YouTube, taking snippets of recording doesn't really work so well. It's you know, you got to have the right hook and all that.
00:40:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyways, um, but yes is I get it You're right. We're both incredible vaults of Pure diamonds and gold and all that jazz And I think that we have slightly different take some things But also we could say the same thing and we'll express it differently Which means somebody's brain is going to receive it differently and that's great. Oh, yeah Because we get to cover more types of brains and people. Yeah, and when I want my Marketing thing that I launched about four years ago was I am possible marketing because I love Audrey Hepburn's quote You know the word impossible stands right impossible. So my podcast is called that so because I was feeling low confidence Unfortunately, I brought in you know three other partners Mia Ashley and Sally, which I shouldn't have I should have had them as I Take 80% of the revenue and hey, that's all you guys can come on as 20% because yeah They they were able to get clients from all that marketing. I was doing, and that they weren't sharing, you know, I loved how you wrote out like, hey, we figure out sharing all this stuff because then it actually goes 2500 a month. Facebook adds client, like she still has that client three years later that I hand delivered to her on civil flatter, but I would be happy if I was getting $100 a month out of it.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So being able to create a commission structure. So if anything gets sold, yeah, our products through our emails, through our group, whatever, it's done through an affiliate link, which means you get a portion of my sales, I get a portion of your sales.
00:41:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I impossible as my baby and me and Sally put in the most time and efforts in it. And yet for Ashley, me and I still love them. so good friends. They're big where their own businesses. So like they all got clients from an exposure from it because they're shy and they would never go out and do marketing on their own like I did, but they would then be invited into teaching community. the point is to respect, I respect them a lot, but they might have different answers than I would do. But we would say that, hey, you know, me and my family. our different take on it and you know and that's okay but this is how I would do it like we'd be very upfront with our community about that too.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and so part of that responsibility would be making sure that we have excellent analytics so GA4 I've got a girl who knows that Dan knows it really well and he would easily come help us and consult to make sure that we've got great tracking yeah so that is GA4 yeah so we could track like if sales came through one of your own videos that you did we have a structure that says if this tag exists maria gets this portion if this tag exists tina gets this portion like we could be really that way we have as much protection of and there could be no feelings of bitterness and it will all be protected um so that it's uh yeah and all um anyway my brain is going a million miles an hour but but we could sort the task unless and it would it would the only us would be on both of us to be honest about how we feel. Do we feel like this task assignment is equal? Do you feel like what we're creating and contributing is equal? So if you, if I say something with confidence and you're feeling like that doesn't feel fair, but you don't tell me that's on you, you have to tell me, you have to tell me and you have to know that that's safe and that you can and that'll be okay. But if I'm lying, then you'll know sooner rather than later because you'll tell me, right? You'll see my response on my face. If my face says one thing and my tone says another thing, then you know you can't trust me and you need to pay attention to that.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I like the idea of the back end being some kind of high level agency offer like or to them. So we get them on high level. So we make recurring because that's what's been missing for most of my business models. my exit when I was on fire, my exit in the past was software and it was very good. I could sell my shares in the software company that me and art created with my community. And I was happy, but right now I don't have that and I just don't, my age, I don't want to be 10 years later going, okay, I did not have launch to make money, but you know, we can also, if you're interested, no, we don't have to do this or anything.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't even know why I'm saying that honestly, I kind of do. I just always wanted to do something with Dan, but like, he's got basis. He's got all the analytics. He's got a team that is super invested in high level. He's great at marketing, but he will say things that like he just has no sugar coating and he has no filter. And sometimes it's obnoxious, but, but it's really good to have, I think the balance of masculine energy and also that no filter type of personality and like have him be like a small percentage and see if he even wants it. let us use. basis and your team, and you'll get 10% of whatever we create, but also if you want to have pick your brain, just show up to a call and not just pick your brain. So that's something I just talked to know I had to think about. But either way, I feel like we could come up with a content marketing plan, the tech plan, I have the skills to go set things up and I have a girl to hire to help out with high level and pay for it. So we would create a expense and we would have to approve any expenses. if I'm like, okay, I'm gonna give her 10 hours, she's $15 an hour. Do you agree with that?
00:45:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is what we should get out of it.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then that goes into something that before we get paid, we pay the expenses back. Basically write out all of the structure, how everything will go, who's got access to the finances, how the money comes in, how it gets tracked. all the things to protect it and make sure that you feel safe. I feel safe. I'm probably the same thing as you. Like, I just, I just feel safe. love people. I expect people to be kind to be good and not be dishonest and not disappear. But the reality is sometimes life happens and it's too much for people. And so we'll just make sure that we create a space so that if either of us somehow step out of character, because that would be out of character for us. Then the other person is protected. mean, like, God forbid, if something happened to one of my children, though, I don't know how I would be. I've never experienced anything like that. It just disappeared.
00:46:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then, yeah, yeah, And I know when my nephew and his friend started a, the tornado shakers company that I helped them launch buddy con company that got sold a year and a half later for over million. Oh, wow. I remember we made sure they worked in a like an exit clause for each person. So because also because they were like a third year college, like graduating, like who knows? One would just say, just going to take off to Thailand for two years. ya. You know? so yeah, it was good for them to have. And then also what's cool is that, you know, we could, if we do this right, we could create something that we know we could sell later. I still remember when Frank Kern's chief marketing officer, when I worked with him on a client together with the client hired each of us individually. And he's a brilliant guy, but I was like amazed that he was doing Facebook ads and funnels for 7500 a month flat fee, more for clients doing well already, really well, who already making probably 300,000 a month or more and want to get to a million. And he was really good at what he did and obviously had a bit of a team with him. But literally only two years later, he sold that marketing agency for millions. Like he's basically retired now. So he built that now he had the expertise like you and I have, but he built it all in two years and made it sellable. So I think he might have sold it to Grant Cardone to be honest, but because I was at the time when Frank Kern joined Frank Cardone for a while. Yeah.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. have you read the book built itself?
00:48:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't think so. might actually have bought it might be sitting on my Kindle, but I'm looking at my book shelf over there. No.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Built to sell and even combined. Yes. Make a really good plan, but, but built to sell is specifically about building it so that your, it's not dependent upon you. It's dependent upon your offering. So even though we're creating the content as long as the content is there. So like mama bear marketing versus Tina and Maria specifically. Right. So if it's about mama bear marketing, but then we, we use our names, the brand is still mama bear marketing and we could have like.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know like rosy rivet with the bear i made that with ai once i have to show it to you once because i that was my thing it was a mom bear but she was like rosy and she had the band and everything being do something like that so that the brand is recognizable our faces are recognizable but separately the brand has its own thing if we wanted to sell yeah i used to take my community like when i had those 25,000 paid customers like that's all meringue it out it's community right but we created the software entity called bizblis and that's what got sold out so it was always that for like i used to work in venture capital ages ago for the tennenbaum family in Toronto and a small and we take small companies merge them and then take them public so yeah definitely mom of our marketing is great i think like and we're moreable as well like yeah because you're because also we can't tie it like the community to us and stuff but is good but yeah at whatever we want to sell. So I'm just looking at my cat. She's like gonna bug me soon for feeding her. I have a cat and dogs, dogs that doggy daycare by the cats like getting antsy because I haven't fed her lunch yet. She's quite funny.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can get mad.
00:50:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She'll whack her food bowl. Like seriously. So whack the food because I kind of have a spoiler. She gets her wet food kind of in the kitchen area stuff. But her dry food. I always keep close to the bay window because you just love the bay window laying there allowing there. But she literally will look at the ball. There might be little crumbs in it and she'll just whack it off the bench. That's hilarious.
00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. My, I had a beach on she died during 2020. I see would do that. She would just smack her ball and be like, what's going on here?
00:50:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. So yeah, so so I like the concept and I think, you know, if you want to add right in there mama bear marketing as the entity that's um the only thing is you know you want to serve men too I think men would still come in I almost need the day to come in be like ooh there's women you know yeah um I gotta go to name sheep and see this there yeah and I mean we have you always come up amazing ideas too like spicy CEO marketing could be it too right like because you know like um Dan co quoted someone I don't know who it was but he said you know so so many layoffs and everything happening and everyone's here for the economy thing is there's seven billion people in the world we should have with the internet and what's available on the internet we should have seven billion solopreneurs and I thought oh that's cool concept somebody has it that does not look feminine though it does not like a woman even does it I feel like that was targeted to women powered by system maybe it is So I've got to get going because I want to grab a little snack before the call or protein shake.
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well we can just sit with this, think about it, go back and forth on Onboxer and we can start to flush out a plan, start to flush out the tactical approach for making a good contract. Dan couldn't be helpful with the contract too, he would just do it because he's helpful. And I talk to him all the time. So yeah, anyway, and then if we're meeting tomorrow, then we can just keep going on that or if there's anything else that's useful, but for me, I feel like if we just did this thing together, I automatically would have like, oh I know what I want to do on my own stuff because everything that we would be doing would be applicable, it would be about marketing, packaging, offers, service. I think that it would all be duplicatable for you and for me.
00:53:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree. I agree. And we can even leverage the free community I'm building right now, you know? So yeah, there's lots of lots of power plays here. think there's two phases here. One is you and I both getting our legs up right now. Like for me, you know, I'm getting, you know, my legs up and like, yeah, I get my voice back. And it's then, okay, now let's let's together, we'll be like the rocket that just fuels up, right?
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. creating structure takes a while anyway. So take it at your pace. I actually feel like I'd be better flipped around building the thing together and then taking the energy from that and doing it the other way. Because I would be doing everything with you. And then I automatically know, oh, I just now I've got muscle memory. I'm just going to go do this over here. So, but I'm good with either way.
00:53:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I probably can do that way too. just, it's just for me, my mind gets all frazzled thinking about this year. your skill set whereas my mind right now is on creative like I'm excited to do YouTube videos a month and are sorry a week and later like yeah but yeah so let's yeah let's continue the conversation tomorrow this is cool yeah you go go take care of your um person and I'm glad that we got some this time together this morning all right see ya bye

00:00:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but then I had issues on the other computer.
00:00:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So we did not. I think it's proven and it's your fault.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. you finally review Mercer's analytics stuff?
00:01:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm deep into it. Oh, wait. There's no reviewing.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. Let tell you that.
00:01:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm going through the course.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ryan. Thanks for that, Chef.
00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
don't even bother. Hold on up on that. Because I'm going through Mercer's stuff, and he's saying a lot of . I'm like, oh, that's a really good point. Oh, that's a really good point. granted, some of it doesn't apply to me, but some of it does. So I'm just taking, like, copious notes. I'm going to go through his whole preliminary. force, and then gauge where I'm at. But one thing he said, he's like, you know, I see a lot of people goes, I can't believe he said this. And I'm like, Oh my God, other people do this. He's like, they set up all these systems to collect the data. And then they never really look at it. like, who does that? What are you talking about? That doesn't sound like me. I do that. So it's like, as I'm going through it, like, I actually listened to my podcast too. And he said some stuff on a podcast. I was like, Oh, that's I could do this. I could do that. Dude, he's next level. This guy's just next level. It's crazy. But I want to talk to him at the end, because I know him. But because I do stuff that other like, it was funny, I listened to another podcast and they were talking about him, which I thought was funny. And they were it's this podcast where it was with Ralph, the perpetual traffic podcast, which you might want to watch this one, but I can give you the synopsis. there's this dude, John Moran. So John used to work for this PPC management company. I think you might have been a part of Omar, all Solutions 8. And Solutions 8, he was like one of the faces of it, but the real face was, or is, oh, what's his name? Oh, god, I can see his face. This Indian dude, don't think he's Indian, whatever, he's like, is was the co-host of perpetual traffic until like two months ago. So I didn't know what was going on. John, all of sudden, is working at tier 11 with Ralph. I'm like, that's weird. And then what's his name is no longer on the podcast? Like, that's even weirder. But then I found out that he got acquired. So he sold his agency to some of the other...
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not acquired?
00:04:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, the other dude, solution's eight. Okay. So I think that's why the guy's not on the podcast and that's why John left. He switched to tier 11 because they acquired it. They kept what's his name on as like an advisor. But I guess they're doing, they manage like a hundred million from PVC, the company that bought him. But anyway, John goes to tier 11. Now John's smart dude. But for the longest time, like the better part of two years, he was like just hot and bothered by P.E. Max and whatever. And I tried that and it just doesn't work. I mean, yeah. It looks like it works, but I'm like, these numbers don't make sense, right? maybe a month ago, two months ago, Ralph and John have this podcast or they put out a video, I forget what it was, and John starts talking about forget roas, right? Everyone's hot on roas, he's like, forget roas, you have to look at the internal numbers of the business. like, is this a joke? Of course you look at those. What the hell are you talking about? And then they start telling these stories of how they were just relying, they've been relying on the dashboard analytics of Google or whatever. And then the business owner would come in and be like, I'm losing my . Like, this isn't working. And they'd be like, no, are you talking about? Look at the roas, it's Gen X. So then they, John has a business, started looking inside his own business and started piecing it together like, wait a minute. These numbers don't actually line up. Like what I'm seeing over here, what I'm seeing. inside. So he's like, the real metric is the business, the business revenue metrics. I'm like, is this a joke? Are you really just coming around to this idea? The answer is yes. So they're acting like it's this big epiphany, like ground shifting, f-row ads, whatever. So now, then he puts out this video like 11 days ago. And dude, I watched this video and I called Salko. I was like, you got to find someone to get this lawsuit going. So John figured out that Google is basically, I'll call it algorithmic price fixing. If you use any of those methods, the p-max, row as whatever, he proved across 10 accounts that when he raised the budget, his costs went up every time. It's like you're being penalized for, if you offer the more money, they'll spend it. And by reporting back your results, the conversions, the offline revenue, all that , they're using it against you. So he went in and he went in and turned everything off and he went back to manual PPC, which is what I always run. And he started getting more, more exposure, cheaper lead cost, more conversions, everything went in the other direction. And he's like, dude, we have to try harder to get your business or something, no, no, because the pixels screwed them. So the way for them to close their revenue gap is to just basically rob you more. But under the guise of we're helping you and the metrics that you're looking at in the dashboard make it seem like it's better, but it's not. He's like, it's, I mean, it's, he's floored and they're like, what? the dude. And I showed Salka, I'm like, dude, this is a lawsuit. This is, they're like, algorithmic price fixing. So Salka has a firm looking at it. What the ? And John basically put together the whole case that he's all in this one video. So anyway, so I watched that. I'm like, that's interesting. I don't do any of that stuff. But, and then they were talking about like there is no one source of truth. And then they start, they start talking about Mercer and blah, blah, But, of course, I think they're wrong, but I only think they're wrong in the context of like a lot of that. don't think applies to me. So then I started thinking, okay, unlike, they're all dealing with clients. I'm not. So I do drop a first party cookie, right? So they're saying, And how like, well, none of these attribution models are real. They're all just models. You can't trust the data. And I'm like, well, I can trust that that lead came from a Google ad because I know it did because I ran the ad and I'm tagging it. And it's with the lead. Now, if that person buys later and they came from Facebook, let's say, or better yet a Facebook ad, how do I, and I don't know, I don't think I can do this in Google Analytics, or I think it's going to be like this combo platter. But if I have first, I don't even want to call it first touch. I want to call it something else because it's not a touch. It's like first contact or first something, some other word. Touch would be that they just click the ad and whatever. They click an ad and they submit and I know they're from Google and it's like, I've captured that. And then they subsequently buy and they come from a different Google ad. How do I or better yet they come from Reddit or they come from whatever? How do I start to correlate that and say, okay, and let's say they were new customer. So I go, all right, I got new customers. Where do I get new customers from? new customers that were also a lead came from here. They come from Google. They come from Facebook. Because their whole thing was like, there was another podcast that I watched. were like, you have to go full funnel and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, all right, yeah, that makes sense. But you still need to know what's working. Like, you got to have some idea of what's doing what you can't just say, go full funnel, go spend on all the platforms. And, you know, it's like, that doesn't make sense. But with this, when you have your own cookie, and potentially when you have this, the integration, then I have a segmentrix. I'm like, there's got to be a way to leverage that so that I am getting deeper insights. And additionally, watching Mercer's course, I'm like, OK. And there's other I could do on the Google Analytics side that's I'm never going to be able to get Google Analytics to show me, hey, yeah, this person, I don't think. Yeah, you have, it could probably show me this. You had this many leads and leads up again, customers. It'll never show me it was Tina, because it doesn't have that data. But if it could show me that in Google Analytics and I can just say, hey, show me how many leads I got this month, OK? How many leads this month also were leads and became customers? then how many customers came in that were not leads? And I could get that sort of reporting in there. And then you'd go to segmentrix and say, now show me who they are. Show me who was. as a lead and a customer. Show me who was just a customer. Show me where just the customers who were not leads, where did they come from? But the leads that became customers, where did they come from? And then try to figure out where and especially new customers, which you can only ever get, you know, you could never get new customers in Google. They're never gonna know if they were a customer before, mostly, most likely. Anyway, so then I started, I was just doing this. I was looking at funnel kit, which I think I mentioned like two weeks ago. They have stuff like they capture the referral, right? So I just looked at the most recent new customer and it came from Google because it's using my UTM's. But I'm like, okay, that's here in woo. I don't think that's in metric. I don't think that certainly isn't in segmentrix. So how do I access their attribution? They're coming. right? So they're dropping a cookie every time someone comes, and I'm like, okay, that would give me, if it's in a record, or I'm sorry, if it's in the order record, hey, this is the source, how do I get that into signetrics?
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How do I? I don't know. I mean, I doubt it. I'm seriously dumb to do it. But yes, I'm like on hour six of more Mercer stuff. I just stopped to do this call, and I'm going to go to the office and watch a a little more. Good times.
00:13:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who was it that you said, updated their reporting?
00:13:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I feel like you said in the same metrics. What's funny is none of these people mentioned signetrics, which I thought was funny, because I'm like, dude, they're better because you can do this tagging thing. That's what makes them better. But it's only better if you can tag, if you. If you have the sort of this additional data which I get on form submit through the cookie That's the trust me. I was sitting here. Yes, and I go. Oh my god. If I can actually put this all together Like this just puts basis on a whole different level like If I could go like if I show Mercer, I'm not talking about this before and he's like, yeah, But now I'm like oh Okay, I Can do this other people can't or basis can do this other people can't So but what is it? I did need turn it into something so I could get 20 30 new customers today. Let's go Because I did all that to Tina I figured out all my stuff and we have reached our ceiling Or we're gonna breach it. I would say sometime between the 11th And, actually, let me say what day of the week, what are the days of the week on this? Oh, July, once the fourth, so the fourth is a Thursday. Yeah, so we will probably reach it somewhere between the 8th and 12th of July. We will reach our proverbial glass ceiling. Based on the map. And I'm pretty confident that's correct.
00:15:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what makes it your ceiling now?
00:15:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That formula of new customers and the churn. So you divide your churn rate into the number of new customers you add per month, basically. And then that gives you that will give you your total. of subscribers that you can reach if those numbers stay constant. So if it's 900 months divided by 22, so I blended the, I was right. I was here in 25, it was too high. then when I looked, when I zoomed out, third of the average is 22, we'll call it. And then when I stuck that in, I was like, oh yeah, that's right. And then I went and looked and I was like, oh dude, we're there. Like, we're just about to get that. We haven't gotten there yet, but we're most likely going to get there by that time in July.
00:16:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around that. How do you change your ceiling? what way does it come out?
00:16:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because you're, it's like, it's sort of like, know, when you pour, you pour the water in the glass, it's like the glass is only going so hot.
00:16:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't keep pouring water.
00:16:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I get that.
00:16:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this isn't that. So that analogy doesn't work for me. And also I am my boss. It is that hot glass right now, so I'm not thinking that you're always you're you're shedding a certain amount it's so I guess it's not that it's more like it's more like there's a leak in the glass right so you you're always you have a you're pouring water in and then there's a leak that's at a certain rate so that you're only ever going to get to the rim of the glass you'll never go over the rim because the the inflow and the outflow the map of the inflow and the outflow get you to this so I need to ask these questions because I get that um yeah but I think that there are variables that can be affected to make a change and so like if we improve in retention and reduced churn which may not be possible because it's the nature of what it is um but but also I don't see that they are, like, I see that there is a relationship, but I don't think it's necessarily, I don't know, feel like it's not an actual glass that has a physical limitation. get the numbers, like if the numbers say the way that they are, this is the thing, like we're not improving because we're losing at a certain rate. But the pace of the rate, so like, if churn is what it is, and we continue to bring in new customers, does churn increase?
00:18:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not really. So that's what's interesting, right? churn is across years, but the churn is sort of like the churn. And we've put things in place too. The ceiling is that so that you're up. So your outflow is very constant, so if you can increase your inflow, then your ceiling goes up, but our inflow has never gone up, so it's hilarious. From the beginning, this is the first time I've ever looked at it, but I have it like, we basically average, if there was COVID, there was this, whatever, but if you just look at like the line items, we, it's like a 3.2, 3.3, we'll call it great, let's call it free. It's a $3 million a year business, period, and it's always been in that area for six years, and it's because we always, because the churn's always been the same, and guess what, it. So if you don't get that, the only way up is to raise that number, get it to 23, 24, 25. And if you raise it like one or two, it's a compounding outcome, right? Because your churn does not change to your earlier point. Adding more in the front end does not increase the churn. The churn just stays there. Really, I mean, it's not weird.
00:20:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The reason I'm asking is because you were talking about trying to increase market share, which is, and you've done that.
00:20:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I don't understand how this is. No, we haven't.
00:20:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You didn't increase market share at all.
00:20:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:20:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're subscribers per day. So the market just increased, but your share of it didn't.
00:20:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, where if when you look at the numbers, it's we're all it's all the same. It's crazy. From the beginning, from the first year. We really haven't moved like we move a little up and a little down a little up a little down but when you average it out it's 22 when you average it out it's three million so we're not and when you look at like the total new customers acquired they're within this you yes there's a variation but they're within a very tight window right so let's say 7,000 like every year it's 7,000 and how they come in might be oh for the first part of the year you were averaging i'm going to make this up hey through Q1 you're average 13 a day but in Q4 you're average 40 but when i zoom out it was 22 doesn't matter that i was doing 40 and Q4 doesn't matter that it's 22 yes and it and it's only one year there's only this this was what was interesting was and i wasn't doing this the first and then i realized wait i now know right i learned learn last year that summers are high season so I did this on like the 21st or something I think or the 20th I was working on this for 19th so I was like okay I was looking at the 365 view right oh 22 and then I was like oh well well what happens from January to today so I looked at January today and it was like 16 was what we're averaging right now and I was like okay so that I know right away that like if we are on a rate of 22 that that number is going to increase now but in the summer during that that's new customers yes okay just making sure okay and that's the only number that matters new subscriptions doesn't matter because that's a different number so I was like all right we're averaging 16 right now then all right so obviously I know sales are going to go up over the summer so then by the end of the year that's how we averaged 22 so you can't even look at these numbers go, oh god, we're only averaging 16 a day. So then I said, okay, I'm going to go look at every year from that period, right? So I looked at 2018, 19, 20, 20, right? And it's like, they're all are between like 16 and 19, except one. So in 2019, for whatever reason, I don't know the answer which one. It was 22 a day, that first part of the year, the only time it's ever happened, but then it stayed 22 the whole year. And then guess what? That's the best that was the best year ever. Because it was because of that, but still, when you zoom out, it's not that much better. Like you still end up it was 3.2, I think. Yeah, it was like 200 grand more or something. Um, but so the take away from all of that is, I know we can't affect, I think it's a fool's errand at this point to try to affect your own because we've tried. And it hasn't really changed it, right? have these outgoing offers and day on for whatever. And that didn't even move at a point. So I'm like, okay, I don't think there's a whole lot we can do there. So yeah, you can increase lifetime value and stuff like that. But the one that seems most attainable is increasing new customers. It's that run and sort of thing. So yeah, that's where I'm at with that right now. And then I'm talking to this dude after this, the subscription guy that I do that I got the formula from, because he sent this emails like the universe. He's like, these are the four stages of subscription growth. He's like, you're growing from the beginning, right? You're growing. And then you hit it, then you hit a thing and then you lose some and then you get it back and then you just get stuck in this Like maintenance and I'm like, oh my god, but it's exactly where we're at. Like this guy nailed it. like, that's weird But I don't think he's gonna have the answer Unless he can unless he has some traffic guru , which I don't he does like bro where I we were doing all the things that you're talking about I need to solve for new customers and I think the solution is Like I was watching these dudes were also talking about how like Now this is funny How like the pixel is your enemy? Like hey, you're you're you're giving all this data back to them. They're using it against you So then I started thinking all right. Well, what if I gave them data and I've done this before What if I I give them data that they don't know what it is. I know what it is. They don't really know what it is. I tell them, oh, yeah, it's whatever, but they don't really know. So if you haven't really pushed this all out, but if you just look at a funnel from the awareness consideration, purchase, whatever the bottom is, right? And then we have our sites, which I was already moving in this direction, right? CPA exam was awareness. Another 71's consideration. And then Ninja is like the bottom of the funnel, wherever that stuff is called. I was like, OK, I do that? Can I take that idea and extend it to pixels? Do I have a pixel that's my awareness pixel? That I know the only people that are exposed to that pixel are through awareness. So if I go on Google and I buy these keywords that I know are top of the funnel, they don't know that Facebook certainly doesn't know it and then I'm only firing my awareness pixel and I'm only building these awareness audiences that seems like a viable strategy that I haven't really heard anybody do before Yeah, and I'm like, yeah, and then you're just isolating them in these pixels and you never cross between and then you move them from like pixel to pixel, from like stage to stage because if you're putting them all in one pixel, how could they, there's no way to know who's what in that one, in that sort of blue base, whatever, of pixelness of like random people going to your side whatever it is.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But I haven't quite worked it out.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I would really love to be able to look at the numbers with you, because it's like I've said, it's so hard to wrap my head around it without like, when we got the dashboards for sweet love. I don't know, I just processed the data differently, but that means I'm asking questions differently.
00:28:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And I don't know, I'm not, I have a right area.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you screen share?
00:28:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I can find it because I thought it was open, but it's not. This is.
00:28:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't realize until yesterday that I never got a reply to a message I sent you last week asking if we could reschedule today to my family's here.
00:28:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. I didn't. That's right.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister, she went and got me some glutamine, which usually helps me with this and it's starting to help, but
00:29:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you want to bail, we can bail.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want data.
00:29:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I can't find it. Where is it?
00:29:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you going to look at? Are you going to look at the second metrics?
00:29:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would love to see that. No, no. don't even know how to approach that at this point. No, I put it on a spreadsheet somewhere. It's clearly not named something about what I was working on. Oh, my God. Where is it?
00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's going to, like, recent.
00:29:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I am.
00:29:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm opening them all. hate that. Plus I have so many Google accounts and sometimes I put them in the wrong ones.
00:29:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. Now I'm going to get. I haven't gotten this . I get it. up to do do do do do do All right, so so this is over here is basically your formula, right? So it's like you get divided by your 22% churn, or I'm sorry, you get 900 months divided by Come on, where he's must go. I think I'm this thing off. I can Bobby. He always does this. So no. All right. So we have a ways to go. He's like, where they are. I'm like, he counts another 71. All right. So that's what I get for listening to Bobby. All right. So this is my stuff's only based on Ninja.
00:31:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:31:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So we are a ways away from hitting 40, 90. So we'll probably hit it by the. All right. Well, I can tell you because I figured that out. I figured out how many we add a day. I'm going to do this, I like to do it. Well, I can tell you what So 2.2, so basically having eight new people a day. So 40 minutes, 36, So in 55 days, we will make the ceiling, which will be what this August 21st, And it's the ceiling because it's. Because we're not affecting new customers per day. It just is. So the less and I don't even know how that actually happens. So that's part of like. The Mercer's thing is like, you have to know what you're measuring. I'm like, oh, I know what I'm measuring, but I don't know how it's happening. I can take. So that's where the idea of, and I could be totally wrong about this. Like, I. Zoom don't know. It's true that some percentage of leads turns into customers. I don't know if that is a relationship that has any meaning, right? So if that did have meaning, it would be like, okay, go get more leads. But actually, actually, know it's not true, not that I think about it, because or whatever, I don't have to look at it. Bobby sent me the chart and our leads exploded like the fall of 2022 or whatever, and we're still averaging 22 a day.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So... 22 leads a day?
00:34:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, the 22 new customers, right?
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's like... Right. you just said leads and then you said 22...
00:34:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, know, weeks, right, right, because I was trying to think like, oh, if there's a relationship between leads and customers, then you go get more leads. But there isn't a relationship. Or maybe there relationship and customers. is maybe there's a relationship between certain leads, but leads as just this bucket of leads to customers, there's no direct relationship. There could be free trial leads to customers, notes to Google ad lead to customers. There could be some subset that does work, but it's not visible at the moment, nor have we ever looked at it before. So like, if I can figure out where new customers come from, does it shine a light on where I should be advertising more, or I don't know, right? I don't know. But just the idea of, I mean, when I say this to people all the time, more leads doesn't really mean anything sometimes. It's certainly the case here. And then God only knows, right? Like that one year, which is, So, 2019, most customers ever, this is like the ratio of one-time customers to returning customers. ratio is within the ballpark, returning customers, whatever. That was the best year because it got the most new customers.
00:36:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how the hell did that happen?
00:36:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't tell you. Way too long to go. I don't know if I could go piece that together if I tried.
00:36:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you said the market has stayed the same every year?
00:36:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Our market, right?
00:36:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no.
00:36:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
have asked the question before about the market itself. No, it's gone down.
00:36:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's gone down.
00:36:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, that makes sense. overall, market size is decreasing every
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
by what percent?
00:37:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
We don't really know. I mean, the idea, I'm not even sure this idea was true in 2018, but it was like, oh, there's 100,000 people. Now, the number is more like 67. So you could, you could just say 10,000 a year if you're, you know, being kind. But yeah.
00:37:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
10,000 a year. What is that number reduction? okay. And so where would that put that roughly this year?
00:37:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
67.
00:37:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
67,000?
00:37:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I think that's the number that I found, but I don't know someone might know, but the AICPA knows. And so it's probably lower than that. to be honest. So yes, we've increased our market share because the market reduced, but that's a metric, right? We have not increased. We have not increased, right? This number is 7300, right? We exceeded it last year, these two year, the COVID years, we didn't get it. But if you take the years that are unmarked, it's 7800.
00:38:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does that 38-93 throw?
00:38:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What date? Which one?
00:38:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2024.
00:38:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Whatever, Jada, did this like the 19th or something?
00:38:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this month, up to through this month. Yeah, through the like that, actually, where the dig for it. So the thing that I just thought that I... haven't thought before is if the market keeps shrinking, like there is a clock on selling this for what you do.
00:39:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes and no, because our business doesn't change. And from that per, from that vantage, it's like, yeah, these guys do 3 million a year. Like, this is a 3 million dollar year business on like, over and over and over.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is a go away. I wouldn't imagine it would.
00:39:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Unless we actually get a flat tax, no. Right. And or we go, I'm a republic, one of the other and none of us are worried about our CPA review businesses.
00:39:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then, there's got to be a point at which it stops shrinking because people like our population is isn't our population increasing?
00:40:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, our populations. Or we were at a level where we're barely increasing or something. But it's that's the whole thing. Like it's going to be it's a cultural thing, right? No one wants to be a boring CPA. So there is there is now, I think, In the industry, they're like, need to start inviting people back into this career. Like we need people to do this.
00:40:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at minimum, OK, 1990 to 2000, the growth rate was 13.15 percent to 2010. It was 9.71 percent, 20, 27.35 percent. So the population is increasing, which means the need for CPA. is the market, whatever, should be slightly and somewhat proportionately increasing because that's just like, I mean, there's people, right? There's people that have to pay taxes. Yeah. So where would you get the data? Like, have you tried with any kind of?
00:41:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. get it. We get it from AICPA. No, we definitely get it. It's it's going down for short. I don't know that I believe them. I mean, I guess they have to be honest, but do they, right?
00:41:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just things like TurboTax and stuff like that impact your market share.
00:41:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, because most people that become CPAs don't do 1099 pilings.
00:41:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But are there less CPAs because less CPAs are needed because TurboTax and things like that exist?
00:41:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, they would they would never do that. That's not there. That's the whole thing, right? So the idea that the population's growing, meaning that that is a need for more CPA's, that's not necessarily true, it would have to be like the population's growing and the segment within there that uses CPA's as growing as well. Right, right, what I'm getting at. Yeah, no, so segment is shrinking because of things like that. I don't, it's not a, the issue is people not becoming CPA's, that's the issue.
00:42:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, but why would people not become CPA's? influences that?
00:42:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And so that was when I was saying, you just, you just said it because the number one career for kids today is to become an influencer who wants to be a CPA.
00:42:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's literally what it is. They're, they're not going into that as a career or educational path because they think There's a better battle. There's a show, demand for skilled accountants continues to outstrip the available supply leading.
00:43:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:43:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:43:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So there is, there was like, so then is the way of increasing market share to talk more people into becoming accountants, like to change the campaign, if not, how do you pass the exam, but you should be a CPA? For us, I mean, yeah, that's, that's the ultimate planting a seed and then hoping it's, right? It's like, that's years, years before they're ever a customer for us. That is, that is, that is, be the strategic of AICPA. They should be out there sewing the fields for that stuff, because they make all their money off of fees from licensed accountants, right? And, but, Yeah, no, for us, no, probably none. No, our thing is to steal market share from other people, like to tap further into the people who are here, or my whole CPA exam strategy is outside the funnel. If we can, and we are, but if we do that better, but I need to be able to track that and know that it's working, right? So it's really the whole thing now is like a what is working thing, right? I know so much of our stuff is brand driven. OK, well, how much? And if that's the case, the whole strategy of a CPA exam is a brand play. Well, if it's mostly brand driven, well, look, then it's like, and this was the case with another 71, too. Well, the reason, so it being brand driven is like a huge benefit, right? like I still argue I could turn off all the ads and nothing would change, but I can get that answer now, right? Like rather than go, who could time to do that? If I can go figure out what's working for real, what do I learn from that? And like, does it point me in a direction or not? And if it's a brand thing, it's like, okay, well, then we should go full funnel every channel or try to, in part of me, it's like, all right, this idea of top of the funnel CPA exam.com. And then if I'm back to like, CPA exam, another step would do one ninja. Right now, ninjas doing all the bottom of the funnel work, right? Yeah, all the ads run for that, it's done, which is the correct thing to do, go bottom up. So rather than go to the middle, I'm just going to go to the top, because the tops, Been proven to work the middle is not been proven to work. I don't know If it is actually true, I don't know if people look at another 71 that way anymore It's been so long and it's been so long since it's been our resource and Jeff doesn't really Make podcasts. I'm like, how do you know if that's viable? CPA exam comes viable all day long and it doesn't require Jeff and it doesn't require Anything really right. It's the SEO everything's happening there right now is outsource. I'm like, okay, if I go there and then on top of that start the seeds that I can plant are The keyword these top of the funnel keywords like CPA exam or do and bump up on and whatever and then let and then somehow figure out Because those have never converted Say that with air quotes Or is it that the conversion window is probably this the conversion window is so long on, I could never see it because I was always only ever looking inside of Google. So if I can get them to come in and be a lead and I get that keyword and I can watch them over a longer period of time and I can say, you know what, that keyword's never going to convert in a 30-day window. But I tagged that person, they downloaded the thing, maybe came with customer six months later. That's, that works, it converts. And then it's like, okay, yeah, so leave that out of it. That the signal from within Google is turn it off. If the signal from within segmentrix or whatever the hell I set up is, leave it on, then you'd leave it on. And maybe that's what I was doing in 2019.
00:47:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't know.
00:47:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I should go back and look at what was our ad spend in 2019. I'm going to do that.
00:47:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. Just be writing down. what are the strategies points and that you could go back. but like I typed in help passing CPA exam and another 71 is at the very bottom of that page and if I was looking at it I'd never look at it first of all like Becker's up there were 35% off CPA exam review and we just know people are like discount let me check that out and then varsity tutors is like big old CPA exam tutor um CPA tutors pass first time conquer CPA exam one-on-one tutor that's pretty powerful and then there's all kinds of videos nothing from any of you guys and then more ads now there's university stuff and then there's like some girl that created a video a YouTube video there's like so many things way before anybody gets to you like page one of Google used to be like 10 and then like there was 10 results now there's like I don't know how many This is 50 before I even see another 71, which doesn't pop out because it's not visual. like with the videos and the images, like this girl, three years ago, and it's only got 108,000 views, but how to pass the TPA exam while working full time, five tips, but like visually, when I even do see another 71, there's nothing that pops out about it. How to pass the TPA exam in 20 days and not die, but it just doesn't really stand out and there's no, it's not in the sponsored results.
00:49:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, I can tell right now that's a keyword, right? But that's not even the point. The point, it's really about like, what keywords matter, right? then it's, I mean, I've had this idea before and I've just. never like okay I guess I need to really go figure this out to me there's the keywords have like and it's funny I just saw Jeff did this and I was like oh he was doing like no okay now that makes sense except he did it wrong but I'm like okay you got it so he used to run competitor campaigns and he would call the middle of the funnel and I was like dude they're they're they're not that they're they're they're not that but then I realized yesterday I'm like oh no they're bottom of the funnel right if our bottom of the funnel is our brand their brand is bottom of the funnel for their brand therefore it's bottom of the funnel for our brand so those should be going to if we ran those and I don't know we should it should be Becker versus Ninja but a really good page but the Becker keyword can't just be Becker CPA review. because that's potentially their top of the funnel, or their middle of the funnel maybe, right? Their brand aware. What's our bottom of the funnel keyword that converts? It's, I'm gonna make this up. Ninja CPA review coupon or Ninja CPA free trial. So I'm like, if I look at our bottom of the funnel brand stuff and I then apply that to all the competitors and then I go send those clicks to a ninja versus whoever, I know that they're close to buying the other thing. So it'd be my opportunity to like say, well, wait, before you do that, which year? That sort of makes sense, right? And you would do it with record because of the most traffic and if it works there, gonna work in other places, right? So, but as you go up the funnel, it's like middle and top, the top of the funnel would be the keyword CPA exam, right?
00:51:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, go ahead. Yeah. Can you can you look at the keywords for what I just typed? So two two things because when I typed in past CPA exam, it's the same exact issue. Another 71 is down at the bottom and I would not think that's a low hanging fruit type keyword, but I'd be interested to see because you said it was a crappy keyword. Like that's what I would type in if I was looking for it. So what is the volume?
00:52:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
OK, this is it. Well, a don't use a keyword to look if they lie. OK, right? that that's the whole thing, right? So here is a million dollars of keyword, a million dollars worth of keyword data, Tina. Mm-mm.
00:53:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you export that so I can just look at it.
00:53:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's going to be ginormous.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I see.
00:53:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What I'm going to do is go. The thing not let you do this anymore really.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the word that gives you the most business.
00:53:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Brand name to CPA.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the second. That's not brand.
00:53:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, no, it's like I'm in the wrong account so I can't really tell you. I mean we could go in here and just do it. This is based on old data so. Oh, yeah, we don't want these 700s, these are bullshid. Okay, why don't you go from converting to zeros. Good grief. This is not going well. Let's do this. So ninja nodes, another silver wand, brand, brand, brand, brand, brand, brand. CPA exam. Well, converted, but. I don't the value. Well, I can play right now. I didn't know this. So this is great. This is over 10 years. But let's just say. 13. I think it's two forty eight. So CP exam. Technically speaking, which is what I was saying earlier, right? It's like, okay. You have to say, if I can, if you start looking at like these other keywords, non brand. Like, that to me, the, and you can categorize them as intent is top and middle. what are those keywords? This is the easiest one for me. like, this is top.
00:55:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Scroll down. Like, can we like look at the first one or just kind of slow? Hi, Sally.
00:56:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And I'm to competitor. This is so I'm running this right now. And it doesn't actually convert. So I'm like, don't know that these are actually customer conversions. These are probably leads. That's the problem. So it's like, if you have the system set up to know, right, going back to mercy or something, what do you want to measure? Okay. Well, then go set that up.
00:56:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So if these work, if these were customers, it would make sense. But I don't know if they are. Yeah, test bank is MCU. Right, so that's a good example of that, to me, is middle. They are looking for a software if they just don't know which one. So it's like, okay, middle. This is neither, but you could say middle because they're. The assumption would be there in the exam. Same thing, taking the exam, probably.
00:57:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's 47 conversions across 10 years.
00:57:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, but God only knows when that one was running, but the key is that the. The phrase the actual keywords are in here. there's a million dollars worth of keyword data here. So if you. got rid of all the ninjas.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The last two years.
00:58:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, actually maybe not, I'm not sure this account is around, not long, I don't know what your account this is. Come on Google. Yeah, I mean, I don't know that this was set up right. But what's real is the key words. Like, this is real.
00:58:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This data is real.
00:58:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
conversions might not be. And then it's like, okay, if you dump this and you go through and you say TOF, M-O-F, B-O-F and just start categorizing these things. And then my other argument was then you test those. on the different sites, right? again, maybe you don't use another 71, right? So, they're looking for a test bank, you send them to another 71, or it's doing the test bank comparison or some . So, anyway, it still comes down to, I gotta figure out where customers actually come from. don't even believe that they're coming from I'm like, okay, yeah, like, sure, Google will take off this credit. Right. Yeah, But is it real? Is it true?
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I do think you would benefit from talking to win. He just is really, really smart and, you know, help you ask better questions. Um, he tell you, you know, he knows more than most people about the validity of the data and what's not valid, right? And I just think that plugging in another brain where you can actually ask questions of somebody who knows what they're talking about, um, would, yeah, I'm not opposed to talk to him at all.
01:00:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just saying, now I'm like, Oh, you know what? I need to, I need to understand what I want to. Understand like I when I started doing this I was like, oh Okay, like I really thought That this was gonna be different like that. I'm like, oh my god. This is the same the same. It's so the same And I'm like, all right, that doesn't make sense It just it's not what I thought it was gonna be Right, and then it's like this year had or I thought of the this breakout room I mean that in this whole freakin three-year period to me even this year's act It's like, okay, we're not even in a normal year Yeah Yeah Okay, well I would like to introduce the two of you because I just think even just having one conversation There will be at least one aha for you. That'll be worth it
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
sure so yeah but I think I'll be I'll be done with mercy stuff very I mean like I'm it's all I'm doing now I'm now I'm like oh okay it if me learning this and understanding this will just help everything 100% nobody else is going to drive this it is the only way you're going to increase that market share and grow the numbers where you want to like I mean you could sell it if somebody's gonna buy it and be happy and you'd get a lot of money but your goal was to grow it to get more money out of it and you know so let's do that let's see what or at least see what's possible explore all the options that are right around us and when being the expert that he it he's just very smart And you can just, like, because he does video calls, um, he did it with my client. And so he just watched him thinking about it. And then he'll go and show a report and show this and show that and just, like, he just thinks differently about it. And definitely at the very least on Mercer's level.
01:03:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. other bit I, I, I, I could tell like I was listening to Mercer for now. I'm going to go watch his stuff like a bunch of his stuff is going to be URL based. And I'm like, nope, I'm not doing that. Like, but that's fine. I don't have to do that. I can do like the way that I set a lead event is the form. So I'm like, okay, so I can just think of things like I know how the site works. And then I think, okay, like I'm going to wait to hear back from funnel kit. Like that date is in there. If they're like, yeah, no, that doesn't go to Google analytics, then I just turned scenario and say, Hey, I need to get this. This is within the data. based. I need it. How do we get it out? How do we get it to? I'm not sure where yet. Definitely Google Analytics, I think. So it's gonna be stuff like that.
01:04:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go do this email intro and I really hope that you guys will have a conversation because I think that I mean I'm the thing is that like you're the brain for it and there's nothing else and you have lots to do but this is really a big puzzle like it's a complex puzzle that requires a lot of data processing to be able to do and obviously to do it in a way where you're mitigating loss that you can't just you could but it'd be stupid to go just pour money out on it and see this work is this for her right so to be strategic about it get all that data so that's gonna take some time and Um, you're the only one that can drive that.
01:05:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yes, I'm I'm like, I got to build the fishing net and I'm going to fish.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, like I've got all the stuff.
01:05:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I've got all the stuff here.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, I just need to put the net together.
01:05:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)

Are you excited?
00:00:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm so excited. I have to tell you I don't usually do video I'm paying attention to my notes and my screen and sometimes I'm not even in the same place. we just good.
00:00:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Sounds good.
00:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, I muted myself.
00:00:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
was like, why are you not answering me? That you're taking notes.
00:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, I have lots of questions for you today. And then I said, let's start with how was your weekend?
00:00:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It was good. My sister and my mom and my dad threw us a baby sprinkle since it's our second child. We're expecting next in about three weeks. So it was a lot of fun to have that. See, a lot of my wife's friends came over to support her.
00:01:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's awesome. And you have, would you have a boy or girl right now?
00:01:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Currently have about a 2.75 year old girl. So she's almost going to, she's going to be three in August. She's like two, two and three quarters.
00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Are you having another girl? have fun with that.
00:01:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have four daughters.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh boy. Yeah. And they're strong and powerful. And it's amazing. It's amazingly difficult, but also pretty awesome.
00:01:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. I was, it's really made me kind of shift my thinking about like powerful, you know, empowered women that I know. And I'm just like, and then of these things like, man, this coaching goes, well, I would love to give this to my daughters someday, know, living that and this is. like yourself, but, you know, some sort of a coach if this goes well, you know, instead of like a nice car or something, yeah, yeah, help them be about more powerful and stuff.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it's the world is shifting and this is, you'll find Fuji that we go through a lot of technical stuff, but also a lot of just little conversations about these things, because it all circles back. So I told you I take a holistic approach to everything and part of it is just learning how we think about things, but there's a kind of you're the one that does all the things. You're the one that runs your business. You're the one that runs your personal life. You're the one that runs your home life. And that person being in charge of everything, if you can apply the same type of mentality across the board, then there's consistency and there's mass power and consistency, right? So in learning how one thing, so I like to make choices that have multiple benefits at all times. So everything I do is leveraged because it serves multiple purposes at all times. So if I do something that strengthens me in my business, then I wanted to strengthen me everywhere else. And one of the ways that that happens is through leadership. So by becoming a better leader, I become a better partner. I become a better leader in my business and for my clients, when I'm coaching soccer, basketball, whatever. So that's one of those things that does everything. So if I study psychology, like I'm working on my psychology degree, finally I dropped out of college when I was 18. I was not for the agendas and the politics and mostly just being told what to do. I was over that for a while. Anyway, but studying psychology. understanding more about why people think the way that they do, understanding where there is agency and choice and accountability and where there's not, where there's chemicals that override and people can't actually make choices. our conversations will sometimes diverge into different topics, but almost always you'll see that they come back and there's a point to it. So just back to you being a dad of young women, you're going to continue to be a dad of young women and you're going to watch them grow. Whenever the firstborn child is a daughter, you have an automatic mother there, but you also are probably going to have, and there's kind of two types depending on how they get to grow up, getting to have a mom and a dad who are strong and loving, you probably won't have all the anxiety that a lot of firstborn daughters do. She'll be strong, she'll be bold, she'll be fierce, she'll be loving, she'll be nurturing, but she'll probably also be super emotional, maybe a little jealous of the second child who comes in. And I think birth order is just interesting. You should study that because it's kind of amazing what happens there. But you learning how to give space for all the things that are going to happen. And also the way that they interact with mom, there's the electro complex. And I can't remember what it is for the boys with the dads. But there's a different energy between moms and daughters, especially strong women, and fathers and daughters. And so there will be a lot of good bonding with you. And there may be some like animosity there. That's just natural. So there's so many things that you just learning how to be the better version of yourself. You'll get making people that plow through other people, but rather just strong. unlike 100 billion gallons of water like it's soft and it can flow into all kinds of different containers and shapes but and it can give life but it can also destroy you know what I mean. So there's different kinds of stories. anyway that was my alarm for you. I have alarms that go off all day long. Okay so I have lots of questions and I think that the best way to start which by the way I do have a call right after this it's mark at 11. So get started and it's just going to kind of be an ongoing process and a lot of times if you want to keep moving things forward then we can there'll be ways that we can do that either through messages or like a shared talk because right now I am going to put all my notes into here. I also use an AI note taker which is recording everything so then I don't have to pay attention so much to writing I could just absorb. um and and you also never need to worry about so sometimes we might need to miss a call because baby whatever yeah yes but the momentum will come so we will have the ebb and flow of life happens in these calls also so we'll have weeks where it's just like whoa we just like that was a we unpacked a lot and um we'll have weeks where it's kind of slow but you know that it there's nothing no traction lost a lot of times there will be kind of pondering life's lifing and um all of that goes into it so it's a very big picture and I just wanted to give you that for the pace okay so how how long so your doctor what I need you to do first is and this part is succinctly as you want it to be but if you feel like there's information that is imperative that I need to know know, then go ahead and share it. And this is one of those things where in the beginning, it feels like a lot of talking. And you're like, okay, we don't really need all that information. But I do all because of the holistic approach, everything is really useful. So you think about that. So I want to know everything that you do in business. And you're kind of origin, how you got there, why you got there, how long you've been doing, if you're doing multiple things, I will want to know the origin of all of that.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And then further deep questions will come into it.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You got it. Okay. Your turn to get away, tell me about it.
00:08:40 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I had a, I had a great childhood. My mother is one of the nicest people I know I will probably ever know. She is loving, giving completely self sacrificing. She gave up her career as a special need. teacher to raise me and my sister. My dad again is a loving man. He never hit us, never hit my mom. I've rarely ever seen him angry. a wonderful loving person works hard as a farmer. So we grew up on a farm. I think when I was about four, he told my mom, you know, I think our farm's doing well enough. You could stay home with the kids. And that's what my mom did. And so she raised us. And my dad's love language is giving and providing, you know, farmer. So, yeah, he literally gave us the best of everything I had private, even though we didn't, we weren't rich, but I had private swim lessons to teach me my swimming. I had private tennis lessons when, I mean, it was an incredible amount of money. Now that I think back, I went to private preschool, private kindergarten. Then we went to public schools. you know, at that time, I had, I had my own skis.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We went skiing.
00:10:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Wow, you know, so a lot of very pricey things for that that period of time in the 80s and 90s For how much we made on the farm parents really invested in you, huh in your family and your kids You know, my dad would spend everything on us, you know, so I got everything I didn't know it I didn't really think of it But now when I look back I'm like that was a ton of money that they spent like My private lessons and my skis and just everything so I had a great childhood. really never got yelled at I think the only time I got yelled at was I tripped my sister And they caught me like I don't know why I did I still don't know why I did But I was about five and I tripped my sister and they got really mad at me for that, but Yeah, I telling my mom yesterday actually that like I was always so well-behaved and never said no to them because I wanted their love and I am extremely extremely Externally motivated like that. want people's love. I want their affection And and it makes me it made me a good doctor, I think, but it makes me a poor person to do interpersonal due diligence. Like, if someone's nice to me, I am the easiest person to come on. know, I, you know, that I and that period with I don't do due diligence when I like someone.
00:11:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I'll just trust them to be good.
00:11:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And you'll see in my emails that I sent you about kind of my business origin stories, how it just burned five years of my life because of that.
00:11:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you sent me that?
00:11:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
didn't see that. Oh, no, literally, I just and that's another one of my problems that I put, like, I want coaching because this is a problem. Like, I do everything at the last minute. literally just emailed that to you like a minute ago. my gosh. Yeah, yeah. yeah, that's that's kind of my origin had a super happy childhood. really can't like, I couldn't plan a better childhood. You know, I never had any bad experiences. No one abused me. Think in school like middle school. I hung out with kids that we would play like punching games So I you know I get beat up But you know, it was always something that could walk away from and I just never chose to walk away from so I don't really I I guess I got bullied but I don't really consider myself like a victim of bullying them I'm just like well, you know, it made me learn how to punch people better You look for the positive in everything, huh? I miss my parents. just there's just never any anxiety. I had in my life like I never grew up with parents that Stressed me at all like if I forgot my homework my mom would literally bring it to school, right? Like Yeah, worst thing I could imagine is like forgetting my homework And I did that several times and my mom would like bring it and so I really never had like any stress or anxiety growing up around failure Yeah, I just really wanted to please you know that there are people that have parents like that that still turn out very
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very angry and bitter and, um, not choices, there are, actually. So, um, the one thing that I would point out is maybe asking, do you feel like you acknowledged your own goodness for the sake of your own goodness?
00:13:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm starting to wrap my head around that. don't know if like I'm necessarily good, but maybe my positive attitude is something I should reward myself for. Um, I'm learning that more, you know, in my, in my marriage and everything because not everyone comes from the same upbringing that I had. And I'm, uh, I definitely am more, um, accepting of how wonderful my parents were and my upbringing.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that'll probably be something that we talk about a lot, because it's really important to know yourself. Um, and I think humility is critical. I think it's everything for growth and evolution, but there is a difference. between humility and failure to acknowledge your own greatness because that's divine. I'll use God language from time to time because it's the only way I know how to do it. I don't know what your beliefs are but you can use a filter to figure out what applies and ask any questions but it helps me to not have to filter per se you know but regardless and I'll give you a very quick example like for me i'm christian our scriptures say ask him you shall be received knock or ask him knock at you it shall be open asking you shall receive and then there's a lot of attraction which has nothing to do with religion it has to do with the universe whatever but to me that's the same thing it's it's different language it's that there are things that are wanting to come to you and can come to you so just kind of an example of where the language may be different but there's there's something that can be seen into it. There's also you know the science just between of what we believe and the ability to manifest and just because our senses are elevated to being able to think about the things that we want once we've set an intention you know just psychologically our our receptors are on you know there's so there's so many different ways for it. So but um back to giving your own self credits um for the choices that you make it also be really important that you do that for your girls so that they can see that their goodness isn't just because you're good that they have the ability to choose what they do with what they're given because you could have really entitled um that's 100 a statistic that would happen with somebody that is is is so loved and taken care of is that, you know, everybody owes me everything. So, um, you are unique in that humility and that grace and that honor for your family. Um, anyway, so, so we'll have some, some things like that.
00:16:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, uh, let's just let, you know, I might, I, I consider, I, I, I'm open to, I guess some more agnostic. I'm open to the, you know, belief that there could be something higher and obviously I went to like Catholic high school.
00:16:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so, a lot of my friends are devout Catholics and Christian.
00:16:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm just not, I'm not religious in that way. I think if I would have grown up in a Muslim country, I'd probably be Muslim spiritual. I don't know, in Israel, I'd probably be Jewish, know. So, uh, I think I'm, I'm really happy that some people find, uh, spirituality and religion and Christianity. uh, so I'm really happy for people that have that. And yeah, no, I don't my filter in at all because, you know, whether you believe it comes from God or whether I believe it's just, you know, part of, you know, comes to me from my work. I think it's, it's the same idea is, you know, that we should be thankful and to that. Yeah, it's filter is no problem for me.
00:17:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
happy if people are religious and happy if they're, they don't care and I don't care. But yeah, it doesn't come up a lot, but sometimes it does because I don't, I don't know another way to explain why things come up.
00:17:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
cool.
00:17:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love being thankful and, you know, for, you know, what you have, like you said earlier, so I don't care where that really comes from and people around me. I'm just happy that they think they think the way I do so.
00:17:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, it's always nice to like have that positivity. Okay, so origin story. You had a great amazing childhood and you were cared for so being. a doctor makes a lot of sense in that in that way.
00:18:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Also, I actually, I'm, I became a doctor out of fear. Yeah, honestly, like, I'm not a doctor person. I'm really not. I have very little empathy for people. I tend to be very apathetic towards others actually. My wife actually has to teach me how to be more empathetic with her and others. It's not natural for me, partly because, you know, the upbringing I had, I am, I am, I am very selfish. Like, I definitely try to be gracious because I know that that's good. But like, inside my head, I know that I'm a badass in that way. I'm very, very intelligent. And, you know, I'm thankful for all those. things. But like, I don't think that should be at all confused that I'm a doctor, because I became a doctor for the money that I saw that was kind of promised, not promised, but like guaranteed. I made a calculation in college, like what was my odds of having a good lifestyle as a banker, which is what I was thinking of doing, banking, banking, and being happy doing that for 10 years versus if I worked 10 years to be a doctor, where would I be? And I made the choice to, I think I would rather have had the guarantee $300,000 when I was 30, than to kill myself when I was 20 to be a banker and maybe make double or triple that. was a very financially motivated decision that I became a doctor. And I think, as we get to know each other, you'll see that I have zero interest in helping.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people, really.
00:20:01 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Mark said, to be honest with you, some of Yes, 100%. I'm happy when things turn out that it helps others and it helps me.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not what drove you for it.
00:20:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's not what drove me. don't care about helping others. I want to provide for my family. My love language is, you know, to provide my dad. So I want to be able to give my wife, my kids the best, if that's what they want, and you know, just be able to provide. And so to meet that end, and like even my parents, like, I want to be able to, now that they're 70, I want to be able to send them on amazing trips, buy things if they want it, which they don't really care about.
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They actually want everything.
00:20:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
But I want the means to do that. And so whatever means to that end, that's what all that's what I'll do. Yeah.
00:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's good. No, no. I'm not judging, I promise you, I want people to be straight, I'll tell you this, I believe that the world needs every kind of person. We need people who can compartmentalize and do the things, the hard things that no one else will do. We 100% need it. We need people that are able to fight and sometimes necessarily shed blood to protect people who would never do it. It's a terrible, horrible thing. But we need every type of person in the world. And I don't think that all characteristics that a lot of people would think are negative are inherently bad. I also believe, I mean, I speak the, I talk about yin and yang probably daily, definitely weekly. There is light and good in everything. the greater the personality, like the greater the energy, the greater the spirit, the more the better. or great light there is in there but also the more great dark there isn't there because there's equal opposites in everything and in everyone so some people you know they they travel along that full spectrum of the light and the dark throughout their life some people kind of hover in the middle um people with weaker energies you're not really going to notice which way or the other because they're just not that powerful i'm a powerful person you will feel my energy palpably whether it's good or bad which is not great for me because if i'm in a bad mood and it has nothing to do with people around me they're still very uncomfortable and they think i'm mad that they think i'm potentially violent now going to hurt something like i've had people just say i'm terrified of you you will hurt me i'm like i don't even know where you've got that from because i've never i've never had any kind of aggressive thought towards you so my point is that the the there's a whole lot inside of us that I think, you know, the awareness isn't really important. I think the labeling is detrimental because there are so many things that we will experience in life and so many things that we're able to do that may be difficult, hard, and even unsavory sometimes, but can also be for the greater good.
00:23:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the Ying and Yang speaks to me because, you know, even though I'm extremely selfish in what I want and why I've done the things, I also have a balanced, strong sense of honor that I don't do things the wrong way, I don't treat people the wrong way, I don't use people for money, like, or do things that could, that are like, that I would do something for money against another person, like, so, like, I'm selfish. selfish, but like I'm very, very, I feel like I'm very, very honorable from like my parents. Yeah. would never do something or initiate a policy or a part of a business that preys on people because of my knowledge. Like I feel like there's a lot of ways to make money in this world that I don't have to treat people poorly when in fact I can do good things for them and make money. So like in all my, in all my clinic and my businesses and treating patients, I've always done the best. And so that's like, that's, that's a part of me that I like that. Like you brought up like Ying and Yang because I do have a very deep sense of like honor and treating other people well and not using people for money. And that's so yeah, I, I, I say that I'm selfish, like, are you on the book at this trend?
00:24:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which one?
00:24:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Atlas trend. by Ayn Rand.
00:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You might find it interesting. She's very polarizing. She's passed away, but she's a very polarizing author. But it just kind of gives an insight into the definition of selfishness. So, you know, these people that basically, you don't want to give away the book, but the book is like four inches thick. It's huge. But but it's about kind of about capitalism, kind about creators, and how people, there are people that use it and abuse it and have no integrity, and how, generally speaking, government, while, you know, to be something for the people, as generally people are for the government. There are people there that, you know, there there's enough pockets of abuse of power. Yeah, that that have most of the concerns. the 80-20 rule, right? 20% of the people in the government have 80% of the power. We'll say it that way, right? So, but it's still kind of a necessary evil organization because otherwise they're chaos and anarchy and that kind of thing. But to the point of selfishness and, you know, people wanting to take away the money from billionaires, what do they need all that money for? Like if you could understand where the world would be without people who could think like that and, you know, Elon Musk has some very, you know, um, savory characteristics about him. But look at the gifts that he's given to the world. You pick up one end of the stick and it could be the poopy ends and the other end could have gold on it. But regardless, you have to pick up the whole stick. You're getting both sides of it. And that's the yin and yang, right? You can't separate the light from the dark.
00:26:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
They coexist. Period. End of story. My wife likes to say that it's a spectrum. And yeah, I don't I don't think I'm wholly selfish, you know, and I'm not I'm not trying to say that I'm like a sociopath or anything.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not. No, no, I get it.
00:27:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I'm not coming off that way at all. into medicine. We're more definitely more selfish than like to like what a lot of my doctor friends like truly want to help others like martyrs, like martyr type people, you know, and yeah, I just wanted to make sure you're aware that that is not going to be the time to like we got to start on the on that understanding. But I'm not like, but you still do good.

It doesn't matter that if you're, yeah, you're, you're, you're driven for, for what motivates you, but you will not do evil on the path to do it. That's right. And if good comes out of it, great. But that wasn't what you were there for the first thing. I got to, I got to, yeah, got to. Yeah. Okay. So, um, how long have you been, when did you graduate out of college?
00:27:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, 20, 2007 graduated and then. graduated med school in 2011 and then finished all my medical training in 2016.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And did you, because I just remember you gave me notes like at the last second so I had no time to read them? No. No problem there. Yeah, I didn't have the date. Okay, so let me go through here. Because my note taker isn't doing its thing where it's supposed to let me go to like highlight open fathom. Maybe that'll do it one sec. Normally everything is set up. The power went off when I was out of town and and how everything launched the way it's supposed to be. Okay, which is good. can't it um two thousand uh okay sorry 2007 you graduated when did you 2011 finish?
00:28:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
2007 was uh college and then 11 was med school. And then 2016 was when I finally finished all my medical training, so I had to work.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and when you got started, did you open up your own business or did you work with?
00:29:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Stanford kept me on his faculty, so I worked at Stanford for about a year and a half. And during that time, I unfortunately met one of my old college friends who was not a doctor. But in 2018, I quit my Stanford job because we were going to open a clinic in a surgery center together. And yeah, obviously, there was a lot of issues, but he didn't have the clinic ready. Everything was delayed. in 2018, I crawled back to Stanford, asked, could I work again? They said no, but I could do part-time with them. So in 2018, I did part-time. then finally, at 2019, the clinic. opened its doors. A lot of issues. I wrote out a couple at the very, very last email I sent you, but just no transparency in the business side. He was supposed to run the business. So we were getting a decent number of referrals in, which is the lifeblood of a clinic. So we're getting a lot of patience, but the back end was a mess. I didn't know it. didn't look. I didn't check. And then COVID hit, made everything worse. And finally in 2022, early in 2022, I was like, this isn't working. And I said, let's stop this business. So we stopped. Luckily, in 2022, there was a buyer that came along and bought our assets. So we didn't lose everything. We didn't do well. Obviously, we still lost a lot. And my biggest anger about that is I did side work. And you'll read this in the email I sent, but I did side work. for the state of California. In the 20, between 2018 and 2022, I made about 2.5 million, like literally working like weekends and nights. And all of that got rolled back into the business because my business partner had convinced me while any work that you do with us should go back in, which I'm now angry about because I'm like, that was my own free time, right? But anyway, so there's about 2.5 million that rolled in and that was what sustained the clinic because we had to pay staff, we had pay licensing fees. There was a lot of bureaucracy fees. So my extra work was what floated the clinic until it failed or until we closed it. And then in 2022, the last half of 2022 and in 2023, that was the first time that that money that I was doing on the nights and weekend became my own. It went instead of going into the business to get lost, it came into my personal bank account. account. And so that's why in 2023, that is the first year that I made, we made one point, whatever, 1.5 million, um, kept about 900 of that probably. Um, and this year we're on track to do that or more. Um, and it's all just because I don't have this weight of a failed clinic and surgery center. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, that's, uh, that's why I say like I lost five years of my, my life with a poor due diligence and just poor due diligence on my part. Like in the first year we operated, I should have looked, I should ask for the pinows. shouldn't have just trusted, right? And, uh, and so that's, uh, that's what I'm call life college?
00:32:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That costs you a few million dollars, but yeah, that is decent and it lasts you forever.
00:32:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It will last me absolutely forever. So, uh, first part of 2023 is pretty bitter. You know, I'd never been bitter, but I was pretty angry. and better. Last part of 2023, we, you know, I feel like I was myself again in 2024. I feel like I'm myself again. I'm just very positive about things. you know, everything feels back to normal to me. I almost, like, until I thought about this, like, I almost literally forgot about that terrible incident.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, like, you're welcome, but I'm sorry.
00:33:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, no, no, it's fine.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, again, like, I look at it like you just said, like, yeah, it was a $2.5 million like less than it was four year jail sentence that I had, but yeah, that's a good way to actually look at it. And because that that prison, we can, we can be put in prison of different types and it can be mental, it can be emotional, can be partners, it can be spouses, it can be health, it can be all kinds of things. I think, but when we, when we realize that we're in a prison, then you want to get out and you, you want to do the things and I'm glad that you recognize it. dies that the bitterness doesn't have to be there and doesn't have to stay there because that's a choice. People can stay bitter for their whole lives but if you can find what it did for you and make it count for you for the rest of your life but also you get to teach those lessons to other people and that's amazing. That's a gift that you'll be able to keep giving so those really suck. Have lots of those in a different type of way but that's good to know. So how long have you and your wife been together so I have perspective too about how these changes happen?
00:34:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah so we met in 2018 just as my clinic was still not open because it was delayed so she saw me through that period of time when the clinic was supposed to be open I had quit my job I jumped off the cliff already and it wasn't ready to be open on the business side.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have an amazing wife that's very very loving and nurturing.
00:34:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh yeah yeah.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because if that didn't scare her away, you feel to that.
00:35:04 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That pretty much still be a lot of advice to be like everything that happened in the business prison, I guess, is a good, excellent way. I don't really let that, I really didn't let that into our relationship until it was inevitable that, know, 2022 it was going to, but, you know, she saw all of that, you know, through that whole time, I was the happiest person ever. I had a clinic, you know, I thought we were doing well, so, you know, there wasn't really a hard time until 2022 when I realized this isn't right, like I shouldn't be putting a million and a half a year into a clinic that should be on its own feet. So, you know, if you had met me in 2020 or 2021, you would never have believed that anything was a miss in my business, and that's how positive, how little due diligence I did.
00:35:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If we had worked together before this, it never would have happened. because I'm going to teach you to ask all the questions, to look at all the things, to have a process for it. I'm going to ask you so much that you're going to be so annoyed by it. And when you're late with responding to things, and you say, I want to get all this done.
00:36:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I'm like, but you didn't do your work. Yeah, I actually wrote that in the first part of my reflection that I've actually had. Now, when I was thinking about it, one of my friends and I during COVID, we were trying to hold each other accountable. That was 2020, right? Right, when my business, when I thought was OK, but it slowed down to COVID. But one of the things I found was that I knew she didn't know my business. So when we set weekly goals, because I wanted her praise, that I would change the targets, I would lessen my goals so that I could hit them. Or if I didn't hit them, I would tell her on the phone that we owe. Did this I did this to make it seem like I got close like I know that's a problem I have like I crave people's love and attention so much that like that's the kind of I did and mark, you know, I didn't tell mark this but like I'm really gonna make a effort to like be straight with you and not, you know, and not well not to do that but I'm just telling you that's in my nature so I'm really happy that, you know, Mark said that you'll probe your push and like I really want that because, you know, my mind I could think of things to say that makes it sound like I did it but really I didn't, you know, so.
00:37:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark, by the way, does the same thing and so for the first like year and a half he kept giving me answers and I said that doesn't add up I want to see it. We're going to screen share you're going to show me because this is not true and we're wasting our time. I have fired clients. I've not been fired. But I have fired clients because if there's no point, I don't want to get paid and feel like I'm not doing my job. Because there's plenty of money, there's plenty of clients. want to know, my thing I need to know that what I did made a difference.
00:38:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Otherwise, I'm wasting my time. So that's my kind of, competitive. that was one of the things that convinced me to do this because I was like, know, if someone would hold me and I knew my other friend was trying to hold me accountable, but she didn't know my business, right? And I could, I could spin up a story and tell her, oh, I hit my goal this week, right? But, you know, I told Mark, like, and I was thinking, like, you know, if coaching, if I can be held accountable, like, even a little bit, that would just, it would help my revenue would help every, you know, anyways, I put that as one of my goals, think we'll figure it
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
out what works for you. I had one client. He told me the only time I've ever got to do things on time is if you threaten me with money. So if I don't have this done, I owe you $10,000. I'm like, whatever. But it works for him. I've never done that with anyone, but it worked for him. And then one time he did that and didn't pay me.
00:39:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I said, Okay, I'm not working for you anymore.
00:39:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wasn't kidding. So he paid me. And I was like, and now you know, I'm serious. I don't my kids know I don't threaten. I if I say it, I mean it.
00:39:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm willing to follow all the way through. That's funny. No, I like it. Yeah. And I think just no one's ever held me accountable because no one probes me. Right?
00:39:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, if you ask me one layer deep, I probably have an answer.
00:39:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. level deeps. I can think of an answer. then if you start going third level, fourth level screen sharing, know, those are where I fail. And I would be held accountable at that point. no one in my life has ever challenged me that much where it got to the point where like, I can't lie anymore, you know, or I can't, I'm not lying.
00:40:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, no, no, no, I, yeah, you're, you're, you're choosing the perspective or purpose. You're, you're controlling the perspective. Yes. I'm very happy to know that on the first call that I'm so happy that you will work on holding me.
00:40:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If we could do that one thing, that amazing.
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, we have this recorded. I'm going to go back and listen to this. So if you ever just like try to blow me off, I'm like, wait, did you not tell me you wanted this?
00:40:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. And like, the other thing I'll tell you is like, I crave love and attention. And, you know, people to look at me highly, like that money thing, 10,000, I would literally happily, happily pay that if that's still made you think, if I still made you think that I'd hit my goal. That's how like, know about money and how much I care about like, it's true. Yeah, I know I get it. I would use 10,000. $1,000 to make one of my friends think that I hit my goal for that week Like that is how much that's how little like I care about the money Yeah, it's I don't understand it about me But that I'd rather have people's praise and love and think that I'm a badass Then to have 10,000 a week like yeah, it's crazy like That's good too though because that means like money drives you, but it doesn't own you That's what's really important like the fact that you can compartmentalize like so You know, I grew up really really poor and so I had to get over the mindset issues of Money as evil and if I have a lot of it I'm gonna become a bad person and then you know, I And I still I've never worked a lot because my priority has been mom So I work enough to live very comfortably But I don't chase but but really I've averaged 10 hours a week for the last seven eight years
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can make a lot more. And if I was driven by the money, I 100% would, but then I would be here for the girls. But I have created startups with clients that have generated millions of dollars within the first year or two years on repeat. So having to learn how to do that, but I've also fired clients and had nothing while being a single mom of four kids, because I just didn't who I am and what I'm made of if I hadn't been tested. So because you've been tested, you know what you're actually made of. And we only get these defining moments a few times throughout our lives, where we get to see if we are who we say we are. So I really love those moments when they come. When the fire comes, I look at it and go, I hate you. I can't wait for you to be gone. But when we're done with this, I'm coming out victorious. Because I see you. I know what you are and you can't beat me. That's that's just it like I Really know like I'm willing to die for certain things and not stupid things but certain things So it's good. It's good that you are that you know who you are. You want to be held accountable I Want to make sure like so the very I know who I am. I I'm talking about know parts of it You know partially. I don't think any of us even by the time that we're done really really know Everything about who we are.
00:43:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We are so complex.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and 100% and who we are I think a lot of it is relative to where we are and who we're with so like I don't even think there's a specific definition. It's all we're symbiotic and It's so complex, which is why you know, it's just it's just information which is why the probing is necessary. So I might ask the same question three or four different ways, especially if you're not, if I could tell, like, you did not give me a definitive answer. You gave me a nice sounding answer. But you said it, and like, I'm very good at pulling apart the politics and going, but no, okay.
00:44:20 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So that's very good at giving good answers that I think will make people like me.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I bet. Very good. That's your main driver. Then you know how to do it. And you'll be very persuasive and you can get people to also probably tell you what you need to know and want to know. And are you good at getting people to do that?
00:44:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't think I'm good at that. I'm good at people of my enthusiasm. I wrote that from my notes. Like, I'm very excitable. I'm very passionate when I believe in something. And so I think I'm good at getting people to feel my enthusiasm. But I don't think I'm necessarily good at getting what I want. want other people. I've never really been good at asking.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ever get depressed and anxious? No. This needs to be a really honest answer.
00:45:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, I don't think I do. I've never really been depressed. don't. The only times I've been anxious was in 2022. I thought there was a period of about three months when I thought my business partner was going to sue me for closing clinic on us because we're 50-50 partners. And that turned out to be a dumb fear because I realized that he wanted to close it too. But I think I was really anxious in that time. That was probably the most anxious I've ever Yeah, that's probably the most anxious I've ever been in my life.
00:45:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you don't just ever like just shut down and withdraw for periods of time? Okay. No. And your wife would say the same thing? Yeah.
00:45:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Have I ever done that? Oh she has it.
00:46:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, good.
00:46:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You want to meet my wife by the way.
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, not too.
00:46:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it works from home, Oh, hi. Oh, you're beautiful.
00:46:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you just look nice. What is, what is your name?
00:46:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I'm my name is Esther.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love your name Esther.
00:46:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love the story of Esther and the story.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doring her out.
00:46:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Exactly.
00:46:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister is named Ruth.
00:46:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I'll tell you how religious my parents for my parents. Oh my gosh. And you do not look like you're about to have a baby in a couple of months. I know you get a child.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
look at her from behind you.
00:46:41 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh my gosh.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you can have a look at her.
00:46:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
If you click on the video link, you should be able to change the while you might not want to do that. oh, look at yourself. It's a new. Yeah, we're getting there so. Yeah, and thank you. I'm so glad you guys are doing this. I think food just always have been, you know, there's only so much I can help him with. Yeah, it's helped a lot like my mentality and my empathy for others. But I'm really glad he's, you know, got on a recommendation and there's someone that he can connect with to really work with him on all things he wants to work on.
00:47:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, I'm like, I'm just smiling ear to ear and what you don't know, Fuji. Well, I kind of, I think I talked about it on our, on our original call, like I guess you would call the sales call. don't even know. But my, my joy, my greatest joy about the word that I do is actually the family impact on it. I have, mostly I work with men. I'm trying to get to more, more female. But it, it's harder because strong women have had to fight for so much. that they don't know that there's other strong women that they can lean on, because the higher you get, sometimes the more mean women can be to each other. But anyway, but my favorite thing is when the fathers get more time and less stress and more happiness, and then they get to go spend more time with their families, and that might not be an issue for you. I don't know how much you work, but for me, I'm always thinking about the wives, and I'm always thinking about the children, and I'm thinking, how can what I do have an impact on the family, because family is everything for me, and because I've been a single mom for so long, because I've had my childhood trauma, because I had bad marriage and all these other things. It's just, this is my life work and mission, is I do it through the business, but the families are always kind of my thing. So to be able to get to meet you and see your beautiful face just makes me happy.
00:48:57 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, that's wonderful to hear. I'm really glad. You know, luckily I, you know, nothing that Bougie says since I kind of walked in here and working at my desk, you know, is surprising, you know, heard it all before too. But, you know, I love that as well. You know, family is really important to us too. And that's part of the reason why we're building our businesses so that we can have the time with our kids when, you know, they start going to extracurricular activities, you know, we really want to be here for them. I mean, there's still little right now, you know, one's not born yet. But yeah, just, you know, kind of just trying to build that future for ourselves. you know, we look at other families right now and I feel that we're extremely, extremely fortunate already in a lot of ways. And we just want to continue making that better. So I really love to hear that this is the kind of work that you do is, you know, you want to just have an impact on families. And I'm like, man, if there are other, you know, so far, other friends. can use in this coaching too so they can have more time with their family one day too.
00:50:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's amazing. Well, I'm not always looking for I do actually have a couple because so I'm transitioning. I've got four daughters, one's 23, one's 21. I have one grandchild and one on the way. I have a 17 year old and a 14 year old my 17 year olds about to leave so I've gone from chaos so yes, yes. I wanted to have a soccer team okay football or soccer whatever I wanted a whole but my body couldn't do that and I married somebody not very nice. That was difficult. But so I'm transitioning into empty nesting and I've gone from having all the time for the kids to I need to redirect that mom energy into something else that having to grow and feed and nurture. So if you do know other people that are looking for it let me know the match is really important because of the whole. holistic approach because the kind of family orientation. I'm not the person that's like, okay, I want to be 10x by the end of the year, so I could buy a new Ferrari and a new plane. And I want to work all the time. And because we can't connect, I can't relate with those goals. I can't support those goals really well. But I can support that growth and taking care of your body, getting enough sleep, eating well, being happy.
00:51:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's what I put on my email is that if I can learn to sleep, like I wrote that on my first thing, like, if we can hold me accountable and get me good sleep, oh my god, that would be the biggest one.
00:51:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was actually one of the questions I was about to ask you and you've got Esther.
00:51:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I love the name Esther.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yeah, so I have just about eight more minutes before I get a jump on the call with Mark and I want to make sure and answer some questions.
00:51:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Esther, do you have any questions for me? No, I'm good. Yeah, you guys, you know, your time back.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just wanted to pop in and say hi. I'm so glad you did. I don't know if you can hear this smile but I'm burning ear to ear and I'm just so glad for this but the special thing for me today.
00:52:12 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I'm not depressive.
00:52:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No he's not.
00:52:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I've seen depression you know I've experienced little bit of it myself. I've never seen him depressed. He's like the happiest. His baseline he's like the happiest person you know.
00:52:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. You seem like that but there are people that are like that and then absolutely flip opposite when nobody's looking like they're on and then they're completely often so I really needed to know especially because of some of the things that you've described. I needed to know that that was or was not you because you know that would handle we'd have to create a different pattern solution systems around you if that was the case but that's good to know.
00:53:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I always tell people, my friends, like, you know, the thing that I love about food is like, once you get to know him or, you know, even if you don't know him too deeply, he's very, what you see is what you get. So, you know, even with, you know, I'm hungry, dating, there was no guesswork, there was no guessing, you know, what's going on in his mind or what's going on with him. Okay, this is what I think and take it or leave it, you know.
00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's what we're asking about your business numbers. Is that right?
00:53:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
All right, here.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you guys have your time back.
00:53:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I asked her.
00:53:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't nice to meet you. I don't think I'm depressed. That was awesome. Okay, let me rethink about where we're going. Um, okay, just goals accountability. Sleep.

Oh, I just, I will scroll for 30 minutes every night. literally can't sleep before 10 p.m. I will literally find reasons to watch YouTube videos for like half an hour to an hour, sometimes to every night, no matter how tired I am.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like you're an ADHD person? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right.
00:54:47 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I do lay in bed at 10. I'm like, man, I wish I could go on this trip. Oh, I should start planning that trip. Oh my God, look at this. Like, cool house.
00:54:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to buy in 10 years.
00:54:58 - Fujinaka, M.D.
How do I start another business? I can support that. Do you think my current business can double or trip?
00:55:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like you don't have to explain it to me because I have that same brain. So yeah, 100%. How much do you sleep?
00:55:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Seven hours a night probably.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And have you ever had anything measure your sleep for the quality of it? How deep your sleep and?
00:55:24 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's good.
00:55:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you sleep?
00:55:27 - Fujinaka, M.D.
When I sleep. Yeah, I've been tested for like sleep apnea. I do have like very mild sleep apnea, but when I wear like my orang or stuff like that, it's good sleep. But just not, I don't, I have to do something to wake up, you know, or it ends quickly.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have to do something to wake up or it ends quickly. Say that.
00:55:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What do you mean? Oh, like if I have to work and I have to wake up at seven a.m. I'm getting good sleep right up until my alarm goes off.
00:55:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so do you have any signs of sleep deprivation?
00:56:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah. Right now, I'm terribly sleep deprived. I would explain how that manifests. would use, well, I'm just not as enthusiastic. I'm very procrastinated. work is slower. My overall productivity is less. My like emotional range is like limited. Like, yeah.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you ever considered napping?
00:56:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have and then it just makes my sleep worse. Like, if I sleep, if I nap from like 12 to 1 or that night, I won't be able to sleep till like 1 or 2 or 3.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's awful.
00:56:44 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And how much maybe what's coming through my window right now.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the first thing I would say is, please try to get at least 15 minutes of sunshine every day. We'll talk about this a lot. I've sleep packed a lot.
00:57:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yes, we love to hear this.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, with myself and with other people and I will tell you Sunshine has a huge impact and it's different for everyone, but also can help regulate your mood and whatnot and of course there's the blue light blockers at night and things like that. But if you are ADHD, you we know that neurologically you just operate differently than some people. So there has to be some allowance and understanding for the physiology. You know, you can optimize but you can't control. You can't change your physiology completely. Although it's pretty amazing what we can do. can change a lot. I think few people ever actually like there are so many different variables that go into who we be and how we show up and and even the fact that we can modify our DNA and that we can change ourselves at a cellular level for good or for bad with different things, you know that that's really powerful but there's because there's so many variables it's really hard to isolate everything all the time you can't do it you can't have a clean algebraic expression and just go you know this this this and this and then only test this you can't do that that's not life so it's a really long process so we will ask questions about that I'll make sure that include that in things but the goal is to figure out contingencies basically so you'll have kind of a set this is my thing when this doesn't work out this is what I need to fall back on when that doesn't work out this is need to fall back on. And when none of those work out, then I need to re-regulate and come back to center as quickly as I can and just lean into the fact that your body's like, no, not today. Cool. It's not super exciting, but excited to get to work. No, yeah. Okay, so I have lots of notes to go through. I will formulate questions for the next call. already have a bunch of them. So like I said, there's a lot of like getting to know each other. I get to jump on this call with Mark.
00:59:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And if I'm late, I'll just be like, it's foodie's fault. There you go.
00:59:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What that?
00:59:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I said, you did this to yourself, Mark.
00:59:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. What's all of that? We're so great meeting you. I am so looking forward to this. I hope you have an amazing week.
