## Quote 1

> So that's really limited. I can't have a lot of that. Then there's the give back. There's the people. I just want to help all the moms. I want to help the dads too, but especially the moms. the moms are gonna go help the dads. moms are gonna help the brothers. It's like, then they're gonna be taken care of if I take care of the women. 100%. But I want to be able to help them. And that is not a very profitable thing in the offers that I'm thinking about doing because they can't pay as high level. My earnings per hour to start with, like if the number gets bigger, but then I have to hire more people and manage because the more important thing to me is really serving that community very well. So the margins are going to be much smaller. They should still be good, but much smaller. a lot more group effort and but it's a completely different level of fulfillment, a different level of I'm going to say the same things over and over and over and over and over again, which I kind of do anyway, because fundamental concepts, right? But I'm going to say the real big stick things over and over again. And so that doesn't satisfy my big brain efforts, right? The one is like, let me think about all the fun exciting new things, let me learn, let me explore. And on top of that, I'm also serving my mission on top of that, I'm in school for my psychology degree. So, which sounds like a lot and compared to how it's been for the last several years, but I was bored in languishing and I didn't know that. But with those are the compartments. And so when I'm looking at everybody, unless it's, well, even the doctors and attorneys, the entrepreneur visionary ones that reach out to me, they love marketing. They love automations. They love leverage. So I'm working with people who are also, no matter what they're doing, they're not the average type. They have different levels of fulfillment that needs to happen. So all of us need something that has staying power that has the compounding. It's the steady rock, right? So it's got a community. You've got followers. You've got a constant message that really just doesn't change. It's a fundamental message. It's a fundamental thing for you. think it's copy and marketing or maybe even just direct response itself, which is getting people to respond to you based off of what you're doing. But there's also just kind of business. I would really put you more in the marketing realm of what gets excited because of what you go back to most. is offers and serving the the market. So, but you're also interested in business and you're interested in freedom and you're interested in self-providence and you're interested in sustainability and you're interested in people working for their own values not for some arbitrary amount of dollars, not for shiny objects because you want to keep up with the Joneses, right? So, you're the, we talked about this before like average Joe, but the not average, like it's not average. It's think that, so when I'm talking to you about me, to change things. What I think it is is that, and I also know that when we get clearer on what we want, that's when it comes to us, right? Because you can set a really clear attention. Your conversation starts to change who you pay attention to and want to even converse with changes because you've made this switch in your mind and made a decision. This is what I want to attract. So there are two paths that I think that you could consider, and one is, potentially three, one is a consulting gig that is a profit sharing performance-based incentive that is decided from the beginning, so you're not arguing about it. it could be relatively small, feel better not be having a hot flash going on. Okay, then pause is awesome. Anyway, so it isn't about necessarily how big the percentage is, but it's that that there is a growth opportunity, right? Because then the onus is on you is to leverage that. And you can potentially either reinvest some of your earnings into somebody that so you're barely touching it. And that's an engine because it's an engine for you because you brought it because it will keep making money and then you have a person that helps you with it. Like I've been telling you I want you for sure to be using other people's time and talent a little bit more, but first we've got to get you to the money where you can really do that. So that's one version of it. Another one is a you know a profit sharing partnership, but not with somebody old. this is not an ageist thing because some people can be really old and just really just like they're they're still at it there's there's all kind of things but I mean like old in their heart just like right you know like it without fire let's let's put it with that somebody who has fire in them for the stuff that they're doing and maybe they hate marketing but they love their products love the market love but but don't love marketing you know there are lots of those people they're really good at fulfillment and they may be good at marketing but they hate it and they or they also have come to the realization that they're splitting their time doing something that they're not efficient at and can make so much more money so that is the thing I really think that you should be kind of super powering your magnet for yeah Somebody who's very energized very excited and has a profitable product who just realized that They are ready for you know a full-time marketer and can pay a base pay plus performance So your original EHR isn't going to be very high, but your job is to do some really good marketing Research and to see that you're willing to put some skin in the game and go I think that if I put these split tests in if I Created this order bump if I created this continuity program if I Make sure your list hygiene was really good and improved your inbox, but I don't like that's a whole lot of stuff Mm-hmm, but you know, and so it's an investment But that's how you explain to them and justify why you're going to give me this percentage Because there's this is a lot but you really need to make a list of these are all the things I'm doing. This is Each one of these are expert level full time jobs. Do you understand that person like that I'm talking to you? These are all full email, like list manager, full time job, affiliate manager, full time job, marketer, full time job, copywriter, full time job, right? These are expert level things, and you can do all of these things, or you can hire somebody out. So either there's a budget for it, so it's not coming out of you and you make that agreement, to begin with, but either way, I think that that's super leverage, gets you into some exciting stuff, and can keep your EHR around $250 or better. For sure, better would be great. Cause let's do some quick during math. Hold on a second. So if we did, if we had you working at, go away, what is this, these camp? called you base camp. Bye Felicia, hold on, kept you here later. turn 50. I can say, turn 50. the truck times 30 times 4 equals $32,000 a month.

## Quote 2

> I hope that you can find some value in these things and grow in power, purpose and peace yourself. 💙 -end post- I’m Tina Marie, and I’m a business consultant that has helped several startups grow to million dollar businesses within a year, and others to multi-million dollar companies in under three years from their inception. To tell you how I got here, I’d have to go back a good 30+ years. I was entrepreneurial and geeky from the beginning. At 8, I was learning how to write programs in BASIC on a Radioshack TRS80 (think floppy disk and cassette tape drives... oh yeah!) Lemonade stands were a little too social for my taste, back in the day, so at ten, I was mowing lawns and babysitting. By 11 I had a paper route and made a good $65 a month. From that point on, if I wanted something, I was the one who made it happen. I worked in fields picking crops with migrant workers. I worked in school cafeterias and then hustled my way into a job at a Law office as a 16 year old runner for 5 local attorneys when I had decided I wanted to go into law. I managed to get a full ride to college and then quit.. Three times before quitting for good, when I realized I couldn’t stand the agendas and propoganda that came with the education. Instead, I found a way to get paid to learn, and started working in a call center that housed tech giants like Intel, Apple, Adobe and the likes. While I started as a technician, I rapidly moved up the ranks to account management during my 6 years there. I learned that I have a knack for improving any environment I worked in via optimization. My systems saved jobs and accounts before I even realized the power of what I had created. After the birth of daughters, I decided to figure out how to replace my full time income from home. While I went down the “SQUIRREL!!!” path that most entrepreneurs find themselves on, realized I could take my existing skills and find a home for them online. I’ve been growing companies as a secret weapon on the inside ever since... all while having the time to raise my girls, cook their meals, coach them in sports and do the things that matter most to me. And now... 16 years after starting online and 17 years after my first child, I’m sharing my systems with as many entrepreneurs as I can so that others can be as happy, fulfilled, and liberated as I am. Working smarter and not harder is not cliche... It’s an anthem to live by. Follow me, and I’ll show you :) 1. Math is Your Friend 2. Start with “Why?” 3. Mindset 3.1 You Actually Are Expert Enough 3.2 Being Broke Helps No One 3.3 Why You and Not Some Other Expert 4. Pricing and Packaging 4.1 10% Rule of Thumb 4.2 Lead With Value 4.3 Map a Value Ladder 4.4 Don’t Overthink It 4.5 Your Core Offer 4.6 Upsells 5. Example Scenarios 5.1 Scenario One –Lowballed 5.2 Scenario Two - Bump the Core Offer 5.3 Scenario Three - Bump in Price + Conversion 5.4 Scenario Four - Vip Pricing 5.5 Scenario Five - Double the Upsell Price 5.6 Scenario Six - Tripped Up 5.7 Scenarios Seven - Lower Upsell Price 5.8 Scenario Eight - Lower Core Offer Price 5.9 Scenarios Nine - More Please 5.10 Scenario Ten - High Roller 6. Bottom Line Table of Contents Math Is Your Friend. Chapter 1 Most entrepreneurs do not go into business because they love crunching numbers and balancing the books. It is impossible to tell someone you are not speaking to personally exactly how they should price and package their offers. This is my solution to that problem. I am going to give you ten customizable scenarios with different types of products and packages that you can plug into that should help you see what you can change to get more profits out of your business, with very little additional work other than creating the offers and writing them up. Most entrepreneurs get started because they are unsatisfied with the status quo in some way or another and find the only solution is to create their own paths. We venture out on it and learn as we go. And while there are tons of great programs that teach how to SELL or even WHAT to sell... There is very little spoken about how to package an offer and what prices to use to hit your goals. There is a reason for that... Start With “Why”? Chapter 2 Why is it so hard to charge the right price? If they cannot do it at all... obviously you have value. If you can do it FASTER or BETTER than they can... you have verifiable value. When YOU are your product, how you value yourself has EVERYTHING to do with this struggle. Here are some things you need to consider in your mind when you figure out your value to your clients: Could they do will do for them, or as well or as fast as you could? Mindset. Chapter 3 You Actually Are Expert Enough. Chapter 3: Part 1 Most unpaid experts don’t yet consider themselves expert enough to charge money. Easy deal, right? That food is going to cost him money and time, and you’re okay with that, right? Why? Because you gave him value and you both know it. Well... when you’re giving value to a complete stranger who you are only interacting with through websites, text, videos and other marketing materials... even socially on the interwebs... Trading BBQ for your genius skills isn’t really going to pan out. And the bottom line is: If you don’t charge properly you will end up broke. If you know more than the average person does, and you can help them do something they could not do as fast or as well as you can help them to do, then you are expert enough to charge money. Money is simply the currency used to exchange value Look, let’s say your neighbor wants you to come help him on the computer because he’s a technoob and well, you’re awesome. But, because he’s your friend and lives next door... he doesn’t offer money, he offers to send you over some of his killer BBQ when he grills this weekend. Being Broke Helps No One. Chapter 3: Part 2 You are not going to be around to help anyone because you’re broke and depressed. But the economy needs you to contribute! You have a serious obligation to go out there and compete for business and serve YOUR MARKET. You know... the ones who don’t want to do business with that douchebag Steve who may be as good or even a little bit better at what you do, but isn’t worth the investment. Sound a little brutal? I know. But... YOU KNOW I’M RIGHT. So stop arguing with me and with yourself and listen up. Getting paid properly is the way to feel free and happy AND it’s the way to ensure you have the resources you need to continue to hone your craft and offer your products and services to the marketplace. I don’t want this to go to your head or anything... Why You and Not Some Other Expert? Chapter 3: Part 3 There are a ton of reasons why people will want to pay you and not someone else. I don’t want to spend a long time on this so just think about how you’ve chosen one person over another simply on feeling instead of value. If you show up and do the work, you can find a way to get a piece of the market. That’s my pep talk. If you need one on one advice, you can always some time with me for a little tough love. (Paid of course... I KNOW MY VALUE) Pricing and Packaging. Chapter 4 Remember, I don’t know exactly what you’re doing and what you’re offering or how good you are. If you feel like you’re not good enough to charge some of these prices... lower them. Then... improve your skills. That being said... Here’s a good rule of thumb to follow. If you’re offering one on one consulting time or ... 10% Rule of Thumb. Chapter 4: Part 1 Take the highest price you’re comfortable with charging and then ADD 10% to that price. Let’s talk about the different types of products and services you might offer. This is going to relate to digital products and virtual services. Any physical products could be added in as well... just remember to calculate your profit margins accordingly. Once you start getting sales at your price, incrementally increase your price by 5-10% for every new customer you take on until you stop getting conversions. DON’T BE THE ONE TO TELL YOURSELF NO! Let your customers tell you what they will pay. *note – correct pricing and packaging for value isn’t going to be enough if you don’t know how to pitch your offer. If pitching is hard for you, study the book called “Pitch Anything” and work on that skill. It will serve you well in many areas of life to improve this one skill. Lead With Value. Chapter 4: Part 2 First of all, I’m a big believer in leading with value. I grow businesses in many different ways. One of them is helping entrepreneurs craft solid offers and clear their head trash so they can actually pitch them and make money. I found that is SUCH a common problem that I decided I would give as much help with that as possible, free of charge. Obviously, it would work better one on one... but this is a way I can serve my market and find potential leads. Do the same thing for your market. You’re reading my “lead by example” version of that right now. I want you to get some value from me and KNOW I’m worth investing in before I ever ask you to invest. If I can’t do that, I’ll probably not convince you I’m worth your time anyway and that’s just not a foundation I can build on. So find a way to create something of value for your market that you can give away. Create something that complements OR supplements what you already do. Map a Value Ladder. Chapter 4: Part 3 The next thing you will create to ascend them up your value ladder is a low level offer, sometimes referred to as a trip wire. You can have many different entry points into your marketing “eco system”... it does not have to be simply linear... but for the sake of simplicity and what I like to focus on, “Fastest Path to Cash” let’s consider a linear value ladder starting with free, to low cost and upwards. Your low cost product should be something that can solve ONE specific problem for them. It should be easily digestible within one to two hours and should allow them the ability to implement within a day. The price here is between $6-$20. There’s so many ways you can validate that is worth more than dinner for two. It may take you a while to think about why... but think it out.... Write up those bullet points and look at it. When you look at that and say “That’s a no brainer”... You’ve got a winner. Don’t Overthink It. Chapter 4: Part 4 Remember to make it easily and quickly digestible and actionable! The problem you will want to solve is not so much how to give value, not if you know your stuff. It’s going to be more about demonstrating the value in a product they haven’t seen yet well enough to get them to part with their money. So focus on this part! Pretend it’s your best friend and you want them to understand why they HAVE to have this. You would tell them: • Benefit! • Benefit! • Benefit! • Benefit! • Benefit! What are the benefits of your product? Get CLEAR on that and making the pitch will be a lot easier, as will choosing the price. Your Core Offer. Chapter 4: Part 5 The next offer is going to be your core offer. This is the one that should bring you the majority of your income. All of your marketing and products will be leading up to THIS product or service that allows you to give max benefit to max audience size. My preference is that this is scaleable, so it’s a digital product or training that modulated and self-paced (online membership course etc) with possible weekly trainings, live videos, q and a etc inside of a group. This lets you leverage your time while being able to serve more people at a solid price point. Upsells. Chapter 4: Part 6 Upsells are not created to be just one more possible way to squeeze money out of a prospect. Once you’ve shown them value at each level, they are much more likely to want more from you and be willing to pay higher prices if you continue to offer them what they want. Upsells are going to solve a problem that not everyone in your market need solved, but the ones who do need it solved understand the value of it. I’ll use one of my own value ladders as an example: It has to be purposeful and make sense for your market. Keep this in mind... people that pay the least expect the most. It’s harder to sell people on free and $5 than it is to sell the RIGHT person on $200 or more. The person who’s focused on VALUE rather than dollars (no, they are not the same) is going to be willing to spend more. TripWire Offer – Projects in a Box Pre-mapped out project templates for multiple business scenarios to help the “organizationally challenged” get organized fast. $17 per template Core Offer – My Freedom Systems - $97 Four modules in a membership site teaching people Time management, Upsell 1 – Group Coaching $199/month or $999 for 6 months (one month free) I offer 15 minute one on one calls twice a month and a weekly q and a call that’s recorded for all members of the group. Free Optin/Lead Magnet – 10 Ways to $10k Upsell 2 – Business Consultation Call $299 90-120 Minute call with me to create a clear plan for what’s next in the business to increase cash and freedom. RARE UPSELL – I offer this to less than 1% of my audience Retainer client agreement. Price varies. They get weekly calls with me and I speak to them and their team to keep projects on schedule and optimize profits and time. I’ll spend 1-5 hours a week with clients from $2500-$10,000 a month. It’s not for everyone. The ones who want it are the ones who make enough that my optimization skills validate the investment. Applying this to your offer. Think hard and DON’T undervalue yourself. Okay... Here’s the worksheet to help you with some numbers and seeing HOW fast things can add up to $10k a month for you. Did I just hear you say “Finally!!!!”??? I better not have! I had to warm you up to know what to plug in there, Speedy Gonzales. Without context, the numbers don’t mean anything. If you got to this point and skipped the rest above... Slap yourself on the wrist! Then go back up and read it. The strategy is to segment what you offer into a value ladder that you can ascend your customers up through. Use benefit bullet points to help you figure out what a price is for these offers. Think about how much time and stress your product or service will save them. Use reference points like minimum wage hours worked vs. expert hours. If you gave them, effectively, an hour worth of your time, is that not worth twice minimum wage? Is it worth dinner for two? Is it worth ... Well... What is it worth? Example Scenarios. Chapter 5 Scenario One: Lowballed. Chapter 5: Part 1 Lowballed. When you’re too afraid to charge much... do you see how many sales you have to make in order to hit $10,000 a month? Ask yourself... is it harder to charge more and get fewer people to say yes or to charge less and get more people to say yes? Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $5 750 $3,750 Core Offer $20 150 $3,000 Upsell 1 $67 50 $3,350 Total Revenue $10,100 Scenario Two: Bump the Core Offer. Chapter 5: Part 2 Bump the Core Offer. Here, doubled the TripWire cost, but it’s still only $10. We bumped the Core Offer price $7 and left the upsell the same. Here’s the thing. With this offer, you need 315 LESS “yes’s” to get to $10k a month. When you think about what’s harder... getting a yes or a yes at a few buck higher... usually it’s just the “yes” that’s scariest. I told you... MATH IS YOUR FRIEND! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $10 500 $5,000 Core Offer $27 100 $2,700 Upsell 1 $67 35 $2,345 Total Revenue $10,045 Scenario Three: Bump in Price + Conversion. Chapter 5: Part 3 Bump in Price + Conversion. Again... just a few tweaks to the price and now we need even less sales to hit that number. Something to think about is the percentage of conversions that take the offer. The higher you can increase your conversion rate from TripWire to Core Offer to Upsell, the more sales you get, the higher value each of your new customer becomes. As that happens, you can afford to invest more to acquire each new lead. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 475 $5,700 Core Offer $37 75 $2,775 Upsell 1 $67 25 $1,675 Total Revenue $10,150 Scenario Four: Vip Pricing. Chapter 5: Part 4 Vip Pricing. This is a powerful example of what happens when you have higher ticket offers available. With only TWO sales, you just added nearly $2k to your monthly revenue total. See how fast that can add up? Only two sales out of your 450 customers. Improve your conversion rate and that generates a lot more money very quickly. EXCITING, ISN’T IT? Bet you wanna call up your old math teacher and thank them! Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 450 $5,400 Core Offer $37 45 $1,665 Upsell 1 $97 10 $970 Upsell 2 $997 2 $1,994 Total Revenue $10,029 Scenario Five: Double the Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 5 Double the Upsell Price. Here we upped the Core offer $20 and doubled the upsell price. Remember, these are mock scenarios just to give you an visual idea of what happens when just a few numbers change. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $12 300 $3,600 Core Offer $37 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 15 $2,955 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,232 Scenario Six: Tripped Up. Chapter 5: Part 6 Tripped Up. Upped that TripWire and BOOM. More $$. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 275 $5,500 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $197 5 $985 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $10,162 Scenario Seven: Lower Upsell Price. Chapter 5: Part 7 Lower Upsell Price. Some different price points. Lower Upsell prices need a few more front end sales, but not much. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $67 40 $2,680 Upsell 1 $147 8 $1,176 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,353 Scenario Eight: Lower Core Offer Price. Chapter 5: Part 8 Lower Core Offer Price. Lowered the Core Offer price... still making $10k. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 300 $6,000 Core Offer $47 45 $2,115 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $10,082 Scenario Nine: More Please. Chapter 5: Part 9 More Please. Want to earn more than $10k a month? Getting those $20 sales on automation isn’t that hard with a good content or ad strategy. Even with a ten percent conversion rate on upsells, the profits look pretty nice. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 $147 10 $1,470 Upsell 2 $497 1 $497 Total Revenue $14,317 Scenario Ten: High Roller. Chapter 5: Part 10 High Roller. A few years back, Digital Marketer did a study that found that they could charge THREE Times the price if they divided that price into three payments and it converted almost as well, only a 2% difference. Instead of charging $97, they charged three payments of $97 and only lost two percent of sales. Payment Plans are DEFINITELY something you want to consider adding to your model. Product Price Monthly Sales Monthly Revenue TripWire $20 500 $10,000 Core Offer $47 50 $2,350 Upsell 1 - 3 PAY $297 10 $2,970 Upsell 2 $997 1 $997 Total Revenue $16,317 Something else you want to consider is making sure that your tripwire cost balances out your ad budget. Work on your conversion rate and prices so that you break even on any ad costs with trip wire sales. In other words... If it costs you $2 for a new lead and your tripwire is $20, you need to convert every tenth lead into a customer to break even. Or... lower your lead cost. Or... raise your tripwire cost... but that could hurt you if you go above $20 depending on your market. If you’ve served them well with your free offer, you may be able to get more. Bottom Line. Chapter 6 Math is your friend! Interested in getting one on one help? Click Here to Book a Two Hour call with me to get some rocket fuel for your business.

## Quote 3

> So no, I had like four or five. That was the original. And then I realized that there's, um, there's the next level stuff. So like the sharpen your saw and like mind your heart, those two last ones. They are like, how do you feed the visionary? How do you keep that person, um, up with everything, sharpening your shawl, whatever you're the best at, you have to keep doing it. You do it normally and naturally, but basically it's the shield against apathy and complacency. And then the mind's your heart or yeah, mind's your heart. So that's about heart and mind. It's that we're human beings. Um, and if you don't constantly feed yourself with positive information that strengthens you, that encourages you. urges you that uplifts you when it's a fan because it will, when you lose a spouse, when you lose a child, when you lose some function in your body, when you lose a parent, whatever, whatever happens when we go through a recession, something's going to happen to you. If you haven't intentionally been fortifying yourself on a daily basis, on a steady basis, when that comes, it's going to crush you. So that's something that is a part of my process, right? We do it in our coaching sessions and things like that. But it's not, you know, technically the business stuff, but it 100% is a strategy. It's an intentional strategy. It's a regular part of my practice. And so it got added into it. And yeah, anyway, so that's how it came about. So with Visa, I would just say, what are the things you always teach people? And I would show her how to use chat TBT and a Google Doc, and just go like, what are the things like, tell me some of the stories? Well, in those stories, we're going to extract a concept and she could start by telling chat GPT stories and then go okay what is the premise what is the concept that I taught and I could teach her how to do those things and then now she's got something that she can be working with if it's three o'clock in the morning and she can't sleep and she's like these things are on her mind but you don't want to go call somebody because everybody else is sleeping because they're saying they're not really um you know what I mean so that could be I could teach her those things because that's what I've been doing with this is using chat GPT telling it stories and then having it give me some like extraction like what did you notice I'm like oh yeah that's what I do and then I go write something what yeah yeah so anyway okay so sorry that was just there no even clear ending point I've got lots of questions for you and I've already taken a letter of time so I'll wait till next week but also thank you for being

> Okay. But yeah, but we typically don't talk a lot about it because she's really high up at the hospital here in Ontario. Like she's in charge of the whole woman's department, like big time. And so she just for her business too, she doesn't really, you know, come out even though she was married to another woman like ages ago. So I'm bi, like I'll just say it on bi. And so it was funny because when I divorced Rudy, lot of my friends like, you you need to be married to someone probably in health care, because everyone just takes so much from you. You need someone who's like a doctor or some kind of conversation. know, I know, I know that funny. And then my friend, my friend, you know, as we're drinking a bottle of wine, me and my friend, Siobhan, that I've known since grade six, and we've been best friends since, and I was her maid of honor wedding and all that. She we she just said, we're going to get you on elite singles, which is a more dating site, more for professionals, right? I don't know if it's in the US, but anyway, it's called lead professionals. Yeah, and then, yeah, and then that was about five years ago, and then we just started dating and like she, yeah, so she's so, she's the opposite of me. quite funny because I come from a conservative family as well, and all my dad and everything, like I vote liberal now, but my dad and family vote total of conservatives, their oil and gas executives, everything. So she even she's like, I never even dreamed I'd be in a family that's more like progressive conservative, like PC, like because she's really, she'd be the one that was out of all the protests, right? And she'd be the one like having with unions, which is younger, you know, because she wasn't a union before. But now, but now yeah, she's in charge of like a $25 million budget, like wow, 50 staff, nurses, you know, and smart and amazing. Yeah, and she's a very strong leader and a really good coach. Like she's just a really good, she's very, her emotional intelligence is off the charts super high. Yeah, so it's good.

## Quote 5

> He's a doctor, so he's got different types of ways that he provides service and he thought this type of service was the most profitable when really it was this one and he had no clue because he didn't check his numbers because it was a pain in the butt and there wasn't a database and nobody told him how to do it. Nobody made him do it. It wasn't necessary to do the job, but nobody works with me to just do the job. We work together to do the job optimally and optimize isn't just the most out of the least for the business's sake. It's the most out of the least for the person's sake, meaning the most results out of the least effort and stress and overwhelm. anxiety for the people who are doing the job, and everybody wants that. But most people don't think it's possible. It is 100% possible to be so much better at the job that you do now by a few little tweaks of fortifying systems, scripts, documented processes, and SOPs. There including just leadership, talking to your people, knowing what they need, knowing what drives them, and showing them how they can get what they want, and it's completely within their power, and also showing them how they can avoid the consequences they don't want, like losing a job, and how it's completely in their power. So, if you will figure out how you can track their performance and results. Now, this is not about micromanagement, but it is about the micro data. Okay, you're not going to go tell them. I notice you did you got to fix this little thing better. You're just going to show them the stats like I showed you. I'm not telling you on any kind of minute level how you can improve your your average resolution time. I haven't got a clue. You do that. I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to tell you this is the thing. This is the impact it makes. And here are some of the things you can do to improve your team within that figure out how improving your team gets that step improved. Right. So you're going to do the same thing and say these are your goals. These are where you hit your goals. That means something's measurable. Something is measurable. Right. I'm trying to remember because I have your list on.

## Quote 6

> Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.

## Quote 7

> Yes, or just overwhelm. The whole point is to improve efficiencies, not to create more more tasks, more issues, more noise. So it will probably be wrong the first time to three or four. So that's where we need your leadership and having conversations with the team in working through it and be like just use it, tell me what's wrong, what doesn't work, so that we can fix it. This isn't, we are going to do something and you're going to do it. like it or not. Like we're exploring growth and innovation to improve and the specific goal is to improve efficiency but mentally as well. So we've got this entire lag time of task switching, right? And we have this list of basically 20 tasks that have to be accomplished across hundreds of cases. Your volume isn't quite there yet, Patrick, but it will be. And the goal is to increase the volume for everyone. So that scale, you know, there's a ceiling somewhere as to how much we can accomplish and how much we can do well, as well as what's the quality of life day to day for us doing the business. know, our human resources are everything. There is no business without human beings. And we all have emotions and we have limitations and things like that. So just a reminder, the goal of the system is to optimize for the human resources, right? It isn't prioritizing the task so much as the person who is completing the task and kind of building the Iron Man suit around them so it has to be compatible. Now, it is not going to be equally compatible with all people on the team. That's just the way it is because we're all different but we do need to be fairly consistent. Where we can make alterations per person without breaking a system, we will look for those opportunities and I want you to always be thinking about that and working with people. the alteration is just your approach. in getting them to use it, understanding what their intrinsic drivers and motivators are and how you can align what already drives them with the system and how the system can support what is driving them. Does that make sense? So you can keep exploring if you want to right now but maybe don't go whole hog on it right now till we have the conversation with the litify experts. Right, want to invest a ton of time into this if it's going to be a different system anyway. Yes, because so there's a couple of things that are going on. So we've been talking about reports this is kind of an ongoing process mostly due to the fact that we have a lack of frequency and conversations. So which reminds me, I got to follow up. So A lot of it goes through email. have infrequent touches throughout the week trying to work with a guy who works on the little by reports, and then we need to have a same page meeting, but also Mark was a lot like there's just a lot going on. So the pace of this is kind of slow, and I want to come back to that in a minute to talk about what you guys need to do in order to create and maintain and potentially increase momentum. In the meantime, but so we've got the person who creates reports who is not litify, he actually works his brothers and attorney, and they have a firm and so he's nerdy and was figuring it out for himself because litify is not great at reporting. They build this infrastructure, but it doesn't work well. It's very clunky. I don't expect them to be a whole lot better when it comes to the automations, but because Mark pays a ton of money. That's where he wants to start is having conversation with them. And if I get to be there, then I'm going to probe a whole lot and see what we can do. And then the other thing I'll do is take that back to our reporting guy who's also been digging into Letify and see what we can do. So this is probably going to take a couple of months to even get to one like version one that is any kind of really useful. So I want you to kind of put that in perspective. And then additionally, we're going to have a conversation with Slack and because Slack knows Slack really well, Letify knows Letify really well. The two of them know each other a little bit probably, but being able to talk to the experts on each one and then come back and come back to you guys and create that version. The way that the conversations are spread out, we're probably looking at a couple of months as a time frame, essentially 90 days. Roughly, the first iteration of every type of project happens between 60 and 90 days, almost consistently across the board. So keep that in mind. In the meantime, I always like a quick and dirty version of the system and it starts with just awareness. So we have the one spreadsheet that we created, which is all the types of tasks that have to be done per case, and who works on them, right? And then just touching the cases and looking at it and making sure we are on track. So that mostly comes down to file review and scanning quickly. So this is what I want to talk to you guys about. How has that been going for you? love to hear from kind of forensically, like low level forensically. that in terms of what's been happening, what's the anatomy of the case, like our list is basically the anatomy of the case, right? so we know that there is kind of an order of operations, something can happen simultaneously, and that we decided on a particular amount of frequency that for sure nobody should be going even a week without at least getting a text message like, hey, just checking in with you. How is all of that going for you?

## Quote 8

> we just had the meeting yesterday to determine what is the big rock we're up selling this to eventually and we'd agree to be more of the CM pocket CMOCO offer and then also I think it was also like a maybe a group watching thing maybe or is it more just the but anyway so when I know what the end result is then when I record videos and stuff I can indoctrinate them into that other offer right so here's what I think you should I think everybody should keep this in mind all the time if you're going to be in any kind of coaching I think you should have top middle bottom tiers and the and there's multiple reasons for that but I'm going to touch on them super fast sure top tier higher money higher effective hourly rate but also higher level energy coming back from your clients when you work with high level people they teach you as much as you teach them you learn from them it's also higher energy and just higher value so it kind it it financially energy basically and intellectually fuels everything else that you do, the high level tier, okay? But you can only do a little bit of it. It also takes a lot of you energetically and intellectually, okay? The mid-level tier is to me, so we're talking about the 10% that not going to do a lot, the 10%, they're going to succeed no matter what you do, and then there's that 80%. And this is the impact-making group. This is where you make a difference in the world, the greatest difference in the world. These are the most influential, influential, influence-able group of people that you're going to be working with that need you the most that are most primed because they have the money, because they have the understanding, because they have the ability and the willingness to act upon what you're doing, and we're gauging that by the things that we've set out. to attract them as well as the things that we've set up to filter out those who don't match this particular group set really well. So but they also give a significant enough amount of money that they that we're earning from them and they help fuel you know our lives and what we're doing in our business but they're also the bigger pool where we get feedback because it's hybrid coaching right so we're getting some feedback in real time on what we're doing and so it's the biggest pool of it's the biggest feedback loop that we're going to get about how our stuff is working in the marketplace how what we're teaching is helping people or not helping what we need to do to improve what we're doing. Then the lower tier is kind of our give back but it's also the most scalable it's the most hands-off so it doesn't cost a lot anybody that wants it can probably afford it. by skipping McDonald's once or twice a week, if they can't, you know, if they need a leg up, this is where they're going to get it from, but it doesn't take a lot out of this, because once we build it, it's done. It doesn't require a lot from us, but it does don't give a lot because they're getting essentially almost all the knowledge, at least all the knowledge that they're going to be able to use anyway because of what we've already predefined that they're able to do. So, anyone coaching and teaching should have all of these tiers for all of the reasons that I just said, they need the center group for the feedback loop and to make the impact, because anybody who's coaching wants to make an impact. That is part of what made them go into it in the first place. The high level group is needed because of what I said, because you need to have that high energy, you need to have that high earning power. Um, you also want to have high level connections in case you ever need it in the world, but also be a high level connection. So that's important. And then the lower level thing, again, is just the super scalable, um, low, low impact. And if it continues to do well, that's also a market signal saying that this market still exists. Um, it continues to deal with lot of impact. So a lot of touching on it and everything that you do feeds each other. So everything that you do to serve your high level clients should, should come down. So you create, um, the things that you need to really support your high level clients. And that becomes something productized for each of the lower tiers. And so there's not multiple efforts, but there's three levels of entry points. Three levels of earning power three levels of energy, you know what I mean, um, so it can be That you have those three levels for YouTube, but I wouldn't do that because The to be a high level YouTube creator and coach almost really feels like you've got a high level in video production and Yeah, in their minds probably yeah, and that seems like a lot of work Because there's a lot of skill involved. We're talking about huge processing power Yeah, time suck. So having a top middle and lower class for YouTube itself does not seem like a great idea as YouTube as a channel inside of marketing inside of a marketing Operation business hybrid makes much more sense to me as you are such a generalist and I am as well even even in my systems operations that if we're going to have an and you can't the bandwidth required to do more than one high-middle low level type of offering as a coaching consultant would take too much more than I would be willing to give more than you would probably be willing to get so to me that is the offer it's business sustainable um business growth um profits however you want to call it through a marketing systems and operations right and obviously it needs a sexier name but but that's it and so hopefully that gives you some clarity does yeah yeah so yeah um one of the things I'm going to do is put in um to uh

> Well whenever life is lessons and some of them really really suck but some are really really awesome. So yin and yang I'm telling you it doesn't matter like how good things get equal opposites will happen. So the better it It gets in some ways, the worse it gets and not necessarily directly, maybe it's just like the people around you, but it's it's kind of wild to notice. But I've learned that the the fortifying power of the good is that you can see the bad happening around you, but it is less impactful. And it it it doesn't create the pain that it could have the potential to create when you fill yourself up with so much goodness. And that's been interesting and fascinating to watch too that that that bad has less power to do its thing, you know.

## Quote 10

> And then all the other things that you do. So like the automations, that is psychological fundamentals. It is that a person needs to go through this type of flow in order to ascend in order to feel taken care of, and in order for us to be able to get the most out of our relationship with them and vice versa. You that's all of it. So creating it, and then go sell it. Okay, so here's where I was going. I know I'm kind of you know my brain anyway. So with Maria this is the offer that we were gonna it just came out oh my gosh I haven't been able to sleep I'm like on fire with all these ideas when I finally decided to just do it mostly because I'm at the stage where I've only got one little girl at home anymore that made a big difference but it we were I was looking at you know what is they offer to ascend from a free groups this to whatever and I was like here's the deal because she loves marketing she I love offer creation and packaging and leveraging and I do that I think better than she does but she loves putting all the stuff together the ads the images things like that and selling she loves selling and putting it out to all the different platforms so offer creation you and I both know is different like that's packaging that's valuing that's being able to explain the value and know that it's worth it to a particular avatar, right? There's a lot of psychology in that. And then I like building the business systems and the teams. So I'm like, here's what we do. We sell a no-brainer price of $6,000, they get two hours with us, they have to fill out a thorough intake form, which has to be pre-qualified of a certain amount of money that they're making because I don't want people going into debt, spend money, and I feel like I've got a burden because, you know, they can't pay their bills, their mortgage, whatever. $6,000, two hours with us, and then what they get out of it is, and they have to have had an existing business that's already making money. Okay, so what we're going to do is the intake form is going to ask for all of their assets. What's everything you've ever sold? How much did you sell it for? How many have you sold? Do you have any traffic? How much traffic do you have? Where are the sources from? are your conversions, right? all the things that I ask in my intake, right? And so before I even talk to them, I'm going to know all of their stuff, and then I'm going to do a little market research. I'm going look at the price points. I'm going go look at their, I'm going ask for all of their, like, do you have an email list? Do you have social followings? What are all your social profiles? We're going to go look at all the organic traffic they can get, the feedback that they get socially in terms of like what they put out, and then what they tell us they have an offer. So when they get on the call, what we're going to do is, and most of it will already be pre-done, we'll spend most of the time on the call explaining why they want to execute the plan that we're coming up with, and then potentially correcting the plan that we've come up with while we're there because they don't like this, or they don't like that, whatever. And so we'll be creating an ascension path with upsells that have increasing value, but probably increasing burden, so there's a limit to it, right, that like, you know, here, Here's the I don't have to touch it. You buy it. I'm done money in the sleep kind of offer, right? And here's the maybe higher level coaching or maybe I have to fulfill something maybe it's a physical product that I have to fulfill so there's extra cost and things like that Anyway, we're gonna have a whole value stack for them Here's the price point. We're also going to have the hook We're all we will have provided the avatar because she and I can do this stuff in an hour easily go Oh, yeah, I know what this is. This is this is if you Google searches because of our 30 years each in business So for $6,000 they come away with the plan, but also we'll know their budget and we'll tell them you have to save at least $1,000 aside and that will be a combination of Contractor fees and ad budget for 90 days. So the ad budget we're gonna look at like roughly a dollar a day Maybe YouTube ads things like that something low-cost For 90 days and the rest of it will be to pay somebody I need to help you with your web development, like your automations, your video, any kind of support that you need, and you get our roll a deck. So we've, you want this, we've got somebody for that. You've got, you want this, we've got somebody for that. Now, if you want us to do it for you, $10,000, that extra $4,000 is fulfillment. And mostly because we're not going to do it, we'll go hire the people, we'll direct them. And so maybe up to 10 hours each for any of those, but probably not. And I think it's an amazing deal, because 60 years between the two of us, business, online, or in the tech industry, she sold software before she did any of this stuff online. We can fulfill it quickly. And that helps us establish kind of a following and gives us things to talk about and create the content. And in the meantime, So the two types of things that we're talking about showing on the video is so like my time sheet homework. I don't know if you remember that going through the time like all right. So I'm like I should just walk people through that on YouTube and then the offer creation. You know how we've done the calculators where we've done some projections like if we price it at this and we sell X amount of this and the conversion rate to the upsell is this. Do that live like actually have somebody plug in their numbers not like necessarily but record it turn that into video and tell somebody like here's the calculator it's free. Go do this. Here's the time sheet homework and I'm now calling it the profit time energy maximizer and it's the effective hourly rate calculator go do this for free. You can do it for free if you don't want to do it yourself if you want somebody to handhold and want to do it here's the price somebody's going to want to have their hand held and most of them might want to do it for free if not just do nothing you have. have your process for creating offers for doing the math for how you identify a hook. You have a process for market research. You could create your whole system like anytime you launched a product, this is what you go through. You could give all of that away for free and attract high-paying clients who are like, I want that guy in my business. Yeah, and actually a lot of that.

## Quote 11

> There's a whole lot of variables and that's a long-term play and potential like, for example, Mike, who comes in late every single day and takes long lunches and kind of looks like a slacker, maximizes distributions. And the only one that does better on the Rens' team is the Rens, but he doesn't like doing it and Mike doesn't have any problem with it. He likes those conversations. So distributions down the the reason that conversation is difficult is because that's when they're negotiating the attorney fees and sometimes the firm gets more money than the the victim that I don't know what you call it the client and and so they're like well why are you getting more money than us and there's a conversation and the attorneys get stressed out about it and they negotiate down and but but Mike has this ability to basically because he's not the attorney but so part of it is he uses the attorney as a scapegoat and is like well I don't I don't have that ability to do it the attorney because they've already made the decision this is how it's going to be and then just kind of placates the the client but they love it and they don't mind and so he's able to do well at that now can we find other people because that's a that's a leverage point right maximizing fees and being able to have the skill of negotiating that way Now, if there was one of those on each of the pods and they're the ones taking up the time and they're not draining the attorneys with that negotiation to the attorney's brains can be focusing on is the rest of this quality work to be all the eyes and cross all the T's. And this would go back to the book switch of not just finite willpower but the impact on willpower and cognition and the ability to even think well the more stuff we have to wrestle with a. In AKA negotiations, the less mental power we have to be able to look at the details and the nuances of the case well so there are a lot of levers that I didn't even know existed that in meeting with the attorneys now starting to come to light. Where I think having this conversation a year from now will be completely different, not that it has to wait a year from now, but I'm saying there's a lot of it and mark you are the mastermind behind everything but you're all. also an operator. And you are involved in operations, and even if the majority of it is networking, that's still a lot of mental function and power that you have to be applying to that. So to think that you would be just excellent at masterminding and looking at all the different ways to leverage and nuance, you know, that wouldn't be realistic that you would be great at everything all the time. Nobody is. So then it comes on us to have this together and to continue to work the system. But now we're considering different possibilities than we explored three years ago with different data, with actual data to kind of look at it. So I think that we keep the conversation going, but I think that we also consider looking at what are the lever points, so distributions for one that conversation, where are the other points where it has a significant impact on money, so intake, choosing, first of all, their scripts and just the way that they process calls and taking the best cases, not taking garbage ones or whatever. That's a lever point though. How intake handles negotiations for attorney fees is really significant. And then obviously just how the case gets worked up, that it's getting worked up in a timely manner, followed up and all of that stuff. But inside of each of those things is a skill or a set of skills and evaluating the skill set on each of your members of the team and kind of maybe either improving where they can be improved to bring up so that every pod has somebody who is greater distributions and hopefully it's not the attorney so that the attorney can be kind of the you know the hot guy that's looking at everything and making sure everything's going according to the way it should be and and optimized. So anyway we're already like 10 minutes over but I think that we're on a good path. I know that the numbers aren't ideal but the more the better we are at having these conversations and digging in and also just being able to work with the attorneys and if I can get in there with the intake team and we can find where the lever points are if we can improve the skill set on the existing team or figure out how to redistribute work and I don't know that that's possible. know that they work better in pods. I've got that from but if there is a way to redistribute across people so the attorneys of the ones that actually get the incentive pay. If some of that is somehow sifted down, I don't know. But anyway, that's the conversation. That's what we should be looking at to figure out how we get your payroll down. And then the other conversation about marketing so that we can also get your marketing cost down and just be working that system for the next several months to a year. We've been growing, I don't know, your profit margin hasn't been growing, but we've been learning so much, we get to a tipping point where all of those things coalesce to a much more optimized business with higher profit margins. I definitely think that we're on that track.

## Quote 12

> Brought it to your table. But that's reactive and what we want to do now. we're human beings so some things will be reactive. So like if a fire happens you're reacting to the fire but if you don't react to the fire what happens it's a big problem right so sometimes you have to be reactive but we want to plan for and create the ideal environment and system and routine that first of all prevents fires as much as possible. Second of all ensures the fastest recovery when you get derailed because the fire came and you had to deal with something that took a lot of time took a lot of energy took a lot of resources with the team whatever that type of thing. So understanding and segmenting your day and your week based off of types of tasks based off of priorities knowing that everything does have to get done and then also based off of your rhythm. So certain types of tasks are better done at certain times a day. Now there's a kind of a standard circadian rhythm to that. It doesn't apply to everybody. So for instance, statistically most people do better at higher cognitive function tasks like math earlier in the day. And anything passed like lunchtime one o'clock to a clock, that would be better for like task work, grunt work, where you're not having to be strategic, not having to calculate, you know what I mean? So those types of tasks. So what would be a really good exercise, which is not going to be a one and done kind of thing. Everything you do is going to be iterative. I'm just going to keep repeating that and improvement. But is really looking at what what are your types of tasks? What is the mental load of them? What is the you know social load of it? Because obviously if you're in a place where you just want to deal with people less at times a day, right? There'll be sometimes we want to deal with people face to face less or on the phone less or whatever. You want to be able to kind of plan those times for that time of the day. But what should be fluid is knowing that because we're human different things will happen. Those moods will up and flow. They won't always be at the same time every day. So knowing and just kind of checking in with yourself, okay, like my brain's on fire right now. What's the highest level thing I can do with this? Like everything's calculating. I got a savant thing like beautiful mind going on right now. Where can I apply that? That's going to be the best thing to do, right? And that's planning, strategy, it may be trying to figure out a problem for a client that needs to be solved. That's really a good planning strategy leading type thing. And then when you're in a mood where you're just like, I don't want to deal with anything, I can just panel paperwork, but that's about it. So you want to kind of plan a schedule throughout the day that is your norm, right? And when you recognize like you're just not at the ideal place for this thing, rather than grinding, you want to go through your types of tasks and look at it and go, you know what, I'm better suited for this type of thing. Now, sometimes that's not going to work. You may have like a few bad days altogether. We won't necessarily call them bad days, but the energy shift is different. What you can do is different, it may have nothing to do with you. may be the cases that have come through. It could be people, know, whatever the whole... No crazy retrograde thing like sometimes people just lose their mind collectively at the same time, you know, and like you got to you got to deal with that whatever is causing it there's definitely a vibe shift that tends to be like around so if you also take that kind of stuff into account and just look at it so what are the types of things so what I would love to do is kind of create a list together and maybe we create it as a spreadsheet and I'll start it and then we'll just like screen share and look at it and talk a little bit about requirements from you like what does it take out of you can you like knock it out no time no matter what the awesome at it can some of these be a little bit taxing you know when you're having to make calls our distributions taxing any of that type of stuff. So let's kind of categorize the activities that you have to do and then Bob. part of what we think you spend time on, you don't have to do the time tracking. It's always been, every time I've had somebody be willing to do it, revelatory for them. In that generally, they spend more time doing a thing than they think that they do. And that tends to be helpful because then we figure out, oh, that's the thing that we could improve the process on. We could get more training on or delegate to somebody who's a rock star at that type of thing. So, again, it's never about micromanaging. It's about getting information. So, how do you feel about going through and just kind of talking about the tasks that you have throughout the week, of ranking them in terms of value to the business, ranking them in terms of how much it has to be. Patrick, that does it versus somebody else on the team. And then kind of putting the, maybe the energy or the mental resources. that is higher priority. And we're talking super ambiguous now. So once we get the spreadsheets started and we start kind of putting things into containers, then it gets more specific, then it gets more clear, then the value starts to come out. But I'm talking about let's just create spreadsheet. Right now, screen share, do this together as an activity and see what we see.

> Yep. So maybe we consider changing the branding and putting out the language. of hey you guys have seen me be doing you know this thing that thing because one thing that I am is I'm always a student I'm always a teacher I'm always a marketer and in that vein I've done these things in the past but really I'm an expert marketer and it helps you know to state who you are how are they going to know if you don't tell them yeah and and that goes back to the pedigree and the authority post of this is what I've done what you see is what I get excited about because this is social media and I'm being social talking about these things yeah what you don't know is I've done this and this and this and this and clearly this is what I'm focused on and I'm working with you know another systems at like another business growth expert who focuses primarily on systems and teams but is also amazing at market. marketing and that kind of thing so but but I think that you should always think about what are people thinking when they're looking at you and what are your the people that you you're like your ideal clients the ones that would pay the most the ones that you learn the most from the ones that you want to maybe do profit sharing with what are they thinking when they see what you're putting out there just something to think about and if it matters so to me it's a long-term leverage play to always know like what are other the high leverage people thinking when they see it yeah I also am I don't care who thinks what I'm just gonna be me and you know teach and do whatever but I do but there's wisdom that I've learned in considering those things because I have the best opportunity to serve my people when when I'm leveraged, when I'm making good money, when I'm working with very smart, high level people. So I need to make sure that they're aware that I'm out there and that they know what I'm capable of. So those opportunities come so that I keep sharpening my saw and up leveling, you know what I mean? they need to know that I'm out there and what I'm so anyway just something to think about is like who there's an audience that you serve and there's the uh not the stalkers but what are they the the lurkers. The lurkers are the high dollar payers that never say anything but DM you and say hey look I've seen you. I've been like I've got money you know I mean? They they operate very differently but I but I I want you to always think about what are the lurkers thinking when they want to.

> Yeah, but it's just when my God has a plan for me, he needs me to know what I'm capable of. And he needs me to make decisions. And also the one thing I need to know for sure is he needs me to lead by example. And instead of telling people what they should do, I get to be a walking testimony of this is what happens when you do the hard things. So now it's hard to be in an example though. Okay, let me share my screen because that'll haunt me stay focused. Is that the right one? It's not the right one. This is the right one. Dan and my attorney client are just like blowing up email right now. Don't know how to, oh actually, want to, that would stop notifications. don't know how to put my iMac in advanced strum. If I put my phone in do not disturb, it should put my computer. Okay, how many, oh look at my conversion thing. So let's do Trello first of all. And just work on our board there and get that in my way. So I'm going to create a new board. Let's see how workspace settings board creates. And we will call this. So, Good to do. What's called a business launch and scale template board. Okay. this can be like the one board to rule them all sort of thing. And Do that and see what their templates are. I have a job board. I don't know what that is. Go to markets. You know what I don't want to start with the template. I will just create it. Whoa. Well, that's kind of cool. guess I can deal with that. Little dark. I'll deal with what it looks like later. So let's create a 30,000 foot view list and the card is map out master plan. So this is, what does the entire business look like when it's reached full maturation? Okay, I'll grown up. Yeah, that's part of my intake process. I've been using for a long time because sometimes the language, you know, people struggle. with it. So when it's, when it's become the fullest version of your vision, vision, what does it look like? Um, most people think in terms of revenue only making 20 a year, but we get there. Really need to back down. Do this template to be, of course, all of itself. Yeah, if we, if we do it right. So what are you selling? That's the offer stack. How. How. How. How. is it fulfilled, supported, so filled at map out the entire process and ideal stack, including vendors and suppliers and softwares. So if it's digital, right, where's it? Where's it housed? Where is it housed? Yeah. What is the customer experience during that process? Support in, who supports the products, services, and how many people. I'm sorry. does, employees, powers, works, ideal, wages, go level, what level of autonomy leadership they have. So again, we're talking about what is it look like when it's all grown up. Now this is way too much for most people, but this is, but if we're thinking about it in terms of reverse engineering, because even if they're not coming to the table telling you what their big dream and vision is, they have one. And we talk about a lot of times entering the conversation in people's heads. And the other thing is where frustration happens, where offense happens, where disappointment happens, is when expectations are Met and whether they communicated or not and even whether they are conscious of it or not The expectation is that whatever I'm doing right now is leading me to this actual drain and vision. I have in my head The burden then is to make that happen even if they haven't communicated it They're holding accountable whatever they're doing right now to this and most people they're not even conscious that they're doing it They don't know a lot of times people don't ask for help because they don't know how to ask for help They don't know what to ask for help with because they're going like yeah, but I need this I need this I need this Like I can't ask for all these things. can't afford all this help I don't even know how to get from here to there. So That is the thing that most people need is they don't know how to get from here to there. You could tell me any situation that you're trying to do. And I could probably figure out a practical plan to get you from here to there. We can vicariously guide them through getting from here to there by walking them through the mental process this. I almost guarantee you not nobody but most of the people have never gotten this specific in what their big vision is. And most of them even with the specific questions won't be able to tell you what that looks like. But if they can get a version, and this is what we'll say at the bottom if you if you can get a version how what now this doesn't mean that you're going to build what you plan out here. But if you can't even build a specific version in your mind of what you're going for you're having an Alice in Cheshire cat conversation. What path do I take? Where are you going? Don't know. Then the path doesn't matter.

## Quote 15

> No she has an employee mindset and you have a visionary entrepreneurial mindset that's what that issue is that's going to be an issue that is going to cause problems as long as you consult with her regarding growth. God. So you either need to keep her in an employee role and don't counsel with her as a partner of any type and decision making and growth and you need to compartmentalize her or you're going to need to just not have her which I don't think is what you want to do but something is going to have to change at that dynamic, if you're going to keep growing and evolving, and especially now that she has kids, that that would have existed already. But now she's nesting and that is counterproductive to what you're trying to do. So I had, I'll give you an example. And this is this is not the only thing. It's just the thing that pops in my head, because there's lots of different partnerships and things that pop up. I remember one time, because I worked at a call center, everywhere I worked, even when I was a teenager, I got promoted almost instantly, like within weeks. And so I worked at a call center and I got promoted probably 13 times in six years and ended up doubling my wages and that amount of time. I worked for first it was Apple and Intel. And then I went from Intel call handling to Intel network. working. And I learned how to build networks from the ground up I worked with. NASA at the Pentagon called me for tech support. It was a lot of skills that I had. but the payment like, you know, I was 19, 20, and no college because I dropped out, got rid of I lost full ride scholarships, I had two of them. And but but it was an opportunity without school to get paid to learn some massive skills, which have actually been the foundation for my business skills. And but I would constantly get promoted. So I'd be moving and having new jobs and new training, I got put into management training and certifications and all that kind of stuff. My ex husband at the time, he's like, you're first satisfied. You're never happy. like, wait a minute, where do you get that? I'm, he's like, you're constantly changing everything. Like, when are you just gonna stay in one place? that was really similar kind of thing. Like, how how do you it wanting to grow with not being happy and not being satisfied, they are not the same conversation whatsoever. Like being happy with something and being happy with the same thing next year and the year after and the year after is a completely different conversation, right? but in terms of having people who have had right-handers, know, well, I'm thinking now that that's what you call a Mary but I've had other people where they had somebody who wanted to show up in tick boxes. And this is a conversation by the way I just had with Lorenz and Patrick but it was specifically about Lorenz's team and I told him you cannot have a box ticker in your company that has to be counterproductive to sweet loss culture because those are people who will do just enough to get the job done. And the way that you work for reviews, the way that you work for the reputation of sweet law because of the impact it has on maids, box-taking will never be a powerful magnet for that. So for example, cases that hadn't been touched in two months, which shouldn't have happened, by the way. So I've got to go back and tell everyone's heater off the ball that it could have been gone that long because that's supposed to be getting cotton reviews. But, well, it did get cotton reviews. I don't remember who said they would do it, said they would do it and didn't do it. So that was 30 days ago. And but now I'm realizing he told me they're doing everything every two weeks. So he should have noticed it within two weeks unless he just, you know, what. or let them go, so that's part of it. But the issue was is that there are certain types of cases that people on the team don't touch, or they, here's the box ticking. I called, okay, did anything happen? There's no response. There's no update. Nobody did anything back. Nobody drives this case except for you, you and your team. So if you don't have a driver, it's going wherever it goes. And just because somebody doesn't reply to you doesn't mean, okay, well, I did my job because I took the box. I made a phone call. And so we had, I probably went on a rant for like 15 minutes on it between him and Patrick to make sure that they understood what the concept is and how you identify it, and that what that actually is, is apathy and complacency and cannot be, like I said, be tolerated. So anyway, there's something that you need to be watching for and Mary as well is to see if maybe there is becoming to be some some apathy. How does it show up or is it you know playing small and what can she do where that attitude can't be contagious and infect anything else in the business but you also need to know what can't she do that might infect other places in the business who could she talk to like is she going to complain because this was an issue you guys had in the beginning was talking behind each other's backs is she going to complain about marks always changing growing looking at offices every whatever like it so deciding on where you want to go is really really important and then where you going you need to make sure you've got the right people going with you yeah but first thing is deciding Where you want to go because what we were talking about last week is, or maybe the beginning of this week was, I don't know if I want to go, you know, drive, go, go, go, go, or just, you know, slow and steady or whatever, which, um, you know, I prefer slow and steady with sprints. Slow and steady because it's sustainable growth, but sprints because that's where you get the momentum and there should be some, you know, level up kind of effort happening, but it's not sustainable to do all the time. As a human being and as a company, it just, and you also can't make adjustments. imagine you're building a skyscraper and you're adding a new floor every time you do a sprint. Well, there's going to be some settling and adjusting. weight's going to change on the foundation. You have to allow. for, and this is, I don't build, I'm not an architect, so, but in my mind, right? You're allowing for the settling to take place before, and make sure it's all firm before you build the next thing. And when it comes to changing, let's see, a new system completely changing the phone system is one major change. an intake process, this call script is another thing. Like, you can't observe all the changes and see how well they're doing if you're making all the changes at the same time. So, in terms of like growing really fast, or growing as fast as you can, to grow as fast as you can, and sustainably, you got to pick, you know, one major thing, insert it, you know, implement it, and then see how it's doing, make adjustment, and then that's the new status quo, and then you build upon that.
