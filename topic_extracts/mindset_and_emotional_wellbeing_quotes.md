Testing testing.

Testing one to. I can't hear you.
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I went into my own settings and check like aah.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good, 1996, I was Apple support. You're kidding.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
cool, love it.
00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. You You You
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You All right, she's getting back. Oh, no, it's keep going. I'll just keep breathing.
00:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep going. My little FTT month slack. Okay. Yeah, I'm right.
00:23:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Cool. Cool. I brought my iPod down to and connected it and we can even just be drawn as if you need to go to. Yeah, I got this an action. can take a picture of it, send it to a boxer after or, you know, yes, please, ma'am. Yeah, I'll do that.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
like, oh, her brain is different. I want to see it.
00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.

And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.
00:53:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

Sorry, I'm late. I had a call just went long, but it was people I haven't talked to for years, and I was like, I gotta go. gotta go. it was so good. They're old clients and they were they are marketing agency and their primary clients were yoga studios and then COVID happened. So that just changed their lives and they couldn't afford to work with me anymore. And so she's just like, for months, she's like, I gotta talk to Tina, gotta talk to Tina. And so and I finally got them back, but it's a moment and pop is a husband and wife team. I watched their kids grow up. anyway, you know how I feel about you guys.
00:00:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, totally.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, my people. So that was fun. But I'm sorry I'm late.
00:00:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
don't mean to be disrespectful of your time. Oh, that's no problem.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How am I in good to get to reconnect? How have you been? you seem like you're doing great?
00:01:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm doing well. You know, just things are going well with Tim who's the the gym owner guy. I've got my first promotion that I'll put together for him. It's going to start next week. And so I'm just crossing all the eyes, that kind stuff and and we'll see how this this goes primarily going out to his Facebook group and then his email list or a segment of his email list about you know 2,500 people and I ran his email this is interesting because like he gets really good open rates like we'll get 48 50 percent people open. But the the are like 0.3 0.4 percent. to and it's like that on every email that that I send every email that he sends even he was giving away thing I was like he was he ran this big giveaway of this it's called an in body scanner that a lot of gyms use so that people can like figure out their body fat percentage and muscle percentage up in skeletal density all this stuff and he did a deal with in body to give one away for free Wow. And send it out to his list and you know point three point four percent fifty percent opened nobody's clicking and so like I've so anyway I've just never run into that so I think there's probably Either he's got some spam accounts in there that may be opened and I don't know what the deal is, but he's working with Adrian Savage on email and deliverability and segmenting getting like the most engaged, 30-day engaged list and that kind of stuff. like he's working with good people on the email front, it's just a bizarre thing. So what I'm doing on this is I'm sending really like one or two line emails and getting people to reply if they're interested in getting the details.
00:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start?
00:04:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right, it will start next week.
00:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I haven't haven't tried it yet. So have you checked his cinder score? Is no, I haven't checked his cinder score.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. What's his emailing domain?
00:04:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, it is. P.F., marketing solutions.com.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And make me log in on to like create an account. Let's go. When get emails, do they go to your inbox?
00:05:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And did it happen immediately?
00:05:10 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes.
00:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's good. And but also like, um, let's check this. Oh, let me call it one second way. And take this underscore.
00:05:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:05:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, hmm. Oh, wow. Awesome. Very high. Mailing from infusion soft. Yeah. Or score 98. There's only one that's 91. all the rest of them are 98. So like, is there a disconnect maybe? And who he's getting on his email list versus what's being emailed out?
00:06:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, he's right now the ads that are running to get people both into the group and into the Facebook group and on the email list. I wrote it while I wrote the ad. It's about it's for, like, it's specifically for gym owners. So it's got all the right targeting as far as the language that attracts people in. that ad is performing well. People are coming to the group, and then they have to answer, I think, two or questions about their gen to get in the group and all that. He's using, what's it called, it's that there's a service that connects your Facebook group questions and infusion soft, so people are opting in to the list when they join the group. Along with all their info, so I don't think it's attracting non-Gem owners, it could be the wrong type of gem owner, which admittedly I don't know what that is, like, what, how to. to find what the wrong gym owner is for him, but I have thought, like on the other side of his promotion for him, of doing, you know, running an ad that's a little, that would maybe pull in some somebody who runs a gym who's maybe little more advanced, like by, because he's got all these different tracking sheets that he uses internally at his gym in Arizona, and I thought maybe we could, you know, give away something that, something like, you know, your marketing math sheet is what he calls it, it's one of the things that he has in his program, maybe if we were to give something like that away, to test that that may speak to somebody who's at a maybe a little further along in their gym where somebody knew they don't I mean they probably have that problem but they're just trying to get you know business through the door. So I don't know I mean he's got a this the girl Amanda who is there like his CMO essentially and Adobson Amanda Dake yeah yeah D-A-K-E and she's great like I have a call with her every week and you know she's she I mean I think she's doing a a fine job advising him and I think she knows him from I don't know if they worked together or what, but she knows Tim from years ago through something else. don't know. haven't asked, but yeah, it's just an interesting thing with his email list, so that's something to work on, and he's got this, but I'm writing so much for him. I he's getting, like, I wrote this new letter for his program that we're using next week, but I mean, I'm excited. It's so much better than the letter he was using, and, I mean, we'll see, you never know, but I think the letter I wrote for him is just really good. the customers will determine if it's a right fit. Yeah.
00:11:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have you been working for him? what is he paying you?

I started like in the middle of April, April 17th. Bill and five grand a month. It's for 30 days. I said a minimum of 90 days and then we'll reconnect and basically see if we want to keep working together, which I think if the promotion goes well, like if it gets, I mean, because he's selling this thing for $7,500. And it's, you know, book a call, that kind of thing. He's got his partner, Randy, handling the sales. It's really about a number of calls booked and people who get closed, and he really wants to follow this, I don't know if you're familiar with the clients and community guys, he wants to follow their model, so he bought their program and gets coaching for them. So I went through that they're training, and so we're running this promo following their guidelines because they lay it out, and it's fine, it makes a lot of sense, but it's basically in a similar to what Travis does with the tapping, so it's basically like all the posts are designed to get people to raise their hand. And he's got this appointment setter that follows up with them through DM to give them the details. I've written like three different scripts for her like DM scripts because they didn't them. But this will be the first time that we're selling, actually selling something. Everything else has just been so far like give value, give value. Which again is what the clients and community guys teach. So I don't know if let's say this promotion doesn't go well. I think we get five or six people to buy. It'll be considered a success and it'll probably want to keep working together. If it's not a success, I think he'll still want to keep working together. he may come back asking for a lower price and which I may be open to, but I would have to reduce the scope of what I'm doing for him now. Because I'm basically doing all of his copywriting. I mean, 95% of it. And all the Facebook posts, it's a couple emails a week. week I did an email every day to promote his event in the fall called the gross summit. And I ran a promotion for that. don't think anybody bought, I think it's a little early to be selling an event in September. But we didn't run a promotion in the group, it was just as email-less and we weren't talking about that. But I didn't want to run the promotion in the group because we got this bigger promotion coming up. that would have, even though the price point for the event is a lot lower, it's like $2.97 to attend. And I thought selling that in the group and then two weeks later selling this bigger ticket item, the sequencing just didn't make sense to do that. And we can run a... Pre-summit promotion later and summer closer to the date of the event. But I'm writing a couple of direct mail letters form as well. And I wasn't going to rewrite his sales letter for this program because I saw it and I was like, that's not a bad sales letter. But then I went through his program. And like I watched every single video at double speed and it's like, oh my gosh, there's so much more in here that is not even talked about. And so, so then I was like, all right, well, need a new letter. Sorry about that. And. Yes, I don't know what I guess I'll see one. He just paid his second bill, so his third one will be June 17th, so we'll do a check-in middle of July to see if he wants to keep working together, and I think he will. I mean, he's been really happy with what I write. He knows that the email list is doing what it's doing. But yeah, so that's the stuff that's going on with Tim. I paid off one of my credit card balances. I was a smaller one. was like $2,800, but I paid it off. That felt good, and then I'll pay off a second one in July, because I'm just setting money aside. That one will be like a little over six grand that I pay off. And, yeah, so just climbing out of the hole, things with Brian are going to well, we're going to do over-deliver boot camp in July and I am, you know, I'm really largely out of the the tech stuff, which is great. And we're kind of in a lull where you were at this time last year. What's that?
00:18:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a that's a big like where you're at right now in terms of the tech stuff, I think is like, I'm so different from where you were this time last year.
00:18:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's great because like, you know, we've I got social media posts now running for. for Brian, that I have somebody else writing, she's from the Philippines, and she's doing a great job. then we've got this, we're taking all the, well, TXL calls, we're Jeremy Wise is turning them into podcasts. so now we're sending out weekly emails every Wednesday for just promoting a specific episode. that's largely hands-off for me because the the same writer doing social media is writing the emails for the podcast and Brian's editing them. And, well, she's writing them, but I built a write like Brian GPT. love it.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, have you been playing with four Oh, yes. Yeah. Crazy.
00:20:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Huh. I've just been talking to it. Yeah.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the ability to train it, how fast it gets like the copy that is spent after I had a few just like it gave me just so lame. And then I talked to it three more times. And then when it's been out, I was like, ah, that's unbelievable what it got to anyway. Okay. So you are Brian GPT.
00:20:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, Brian GPT. And it gets us about 80% there, which I was telling Brian is like, I think that's a huge help. Because he's a little down on it at first. But that's just, know, he's he's always down on things at first. And so I'm just like, you know, this is doing some heavy lifting and like you can just edit it. so now he's all on board. He likes it. And he gave some feedback, and we put that into the GPT as well, and once I explain that to him, it's like whatever you don't like, just tell me, and I'll go back and I'll add that as training to the GPT. But yeah, coming off the last break through advertising bootcamp, we're in a bit of a lull in Titan's world, just in terms of promotions, the next one coming up is over-deliver bootcamp in July. So, starting to plan and think that out. And yeah, I'm not working on anything really big for Brian right now, right? The second, and then the tea business is about to... to launch, so we've got John wrote the really great sales letter that's going to go in as an upsell behind his offer. I always keep forgetting the name of his offer for some reason. It's people signing up for an exercise nutrition program, and he has like 5,000 buyers coming through that every month through ClickBank. So we're going to put this tea offer as the upsell to that flow. And he's already spoken with one other big a click bank marketer who she she has something in the health and wellness. It's not fitness, but she's got something he was telling me and health and wellness and he was telling her about the the tea and she she wants to put the the upsell on her flow as well after we get it up and get some numbers. And then apparently John's got another click bank offer that that is like second second tier in the sense of like volume it's got it it's still got thousands of buyers but I don't think it's like 5,000 buyers maybe a couple thousand a month. And total coming through that offer and it's in the health and health and wellness space. And he wants to, once we get this up on the first upsell, he wants to put it in to that flow. But we've got the letter, and then I've got the inventory and where we just got, I had my designer put labels, design different labels for the packaging. So we're looking at those now. I wrote a conversion letter that will ride with when Pete, so our downsell is if somebody isn't with the 30-day supply of the tea, then we'll downsell them to a sample, like a free plus shipping offer. And so I wrote the letter and the order form that will ride with that sample. And then I'll also have a letter that goes to anybody who signs up. for the membership or just the third-day supply, but it would all be kind of built off of this letter that I wrote for the sample. And what I did for that was I took the letter that Lee and I wrote and I put it into chat GPT and I had it and then I told it a little bit about what we were doing and he and he and chat GPT um uh rewrote it and it's it's great. Like it did a really great job. I you know I got a few tweaks to it but yeah it's fantastic. And so I'm really excited to be re-re-launching this tea business and...
00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How amazing that you even feel that way about it though. just have to think about that. It's it's crazy. No, I'm serious. I have you.
00:26:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
to think about that. I know.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should just the the choices that you've made, Chris. I you can't see the whole you in here.
00:26:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm smiling. Yeah.
00:26:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the choices that you've made, the liberation, the lack of desperation, like you're just in charge of everything. You're not controlled by anyone. You're not a victim of anyone. You don't have to tolerate anyone. You are positioned as peer or all of that was created deliberately. have gone through a process of systematically shifting the dynamics in everything. And you didn't have to get rid of and start over anything to like everything to make that happen. So Bogdan, gone, who her gone. But you didn't have to get rid not how normal people operate. This is not the average general life. This is not average by any means. Most people will never get to this level of power in their life where they can dictate the dynamic, but you're dictating benevolently. It isn't with a desire to oppress. It's with a desire to be free.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and not to use your freedom and power over somebody else.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You seek to bless. And so everything is motivated in a benevolent way, which is to me divine and God like, obviously we're not perfect and we can't be like him, but we can do our best. these relationships that you have, these people that you're working with, this work that you're doing and this piece that you have within that allows you to show up as a dad the way that you get to and as a husband the way that you get to. All of this was done because you wrestled yourself first. You wrestled your fears. You wrestled your insecurities. wrestled your choices and your decisions. And then you also wrestled the opponents, like Bogdan likely. It doesn't mean that they like, like, would be was an adversary. But an adversary to your freedom and your peace. He was his choices were however you want to call it, right?
00:29:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yes.
00:29:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that you are now at a point where you're just like, I can't really get rid of tea fast enough. And I'm like, but it's an asset. What can we do? Well, you know, maybe don't get rid of it yet. And then you ponder it a little bit and you're like, well, I could cut it down to this and it just kind of run itself. And then it expanded again. So it you reduced and then you marinated a little bit and just kind of let it maintain and then conserved energy like a battery filling back up like a solar battery. And now look at what's about to happen. all of that is you and you almost didn't have this partnership because they wanted to. Um, dictate a level that you're like, no, that's not going to happen. But instead of just renovating it and having your energy, you just be like, no, or rather than capitulating, because you're like, I, I'm not going to do this.
00:30:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't want to do marketing. Right.
00:30:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, no, this is how it's going to be. Take it or read it and you meant it and that energy comes through. It comes through people know when somebody means it.
00:30:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so I'm just like, look at the boy.
00:30:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just it's killing it because all of this has now compounding power. Yeah, massive compounding power, because you have alignment with these powerful relationships who are, you know, paying you $5,000 a month, Brian didn't pay you that well, Brian still doesn't really pay you that well in terms of. just showing up to do a job, right? for everything that you've brought to him, he doesn't pay you that well. In my opinion, it doesn't, like, I think everyone else is showing you more respect. And, you know, your relationship started with Brian is different. It's not really an apples to apples kind of thing. And it is about picking on Brian at all. My point is the elevated relationships that are coming that will get to compound in the way that they bring a financial return to you. But that also brings an energetic return to you and gives you more resources with which you can build and create. And that's pretty powerful. While at the same time that's happening, you've gotten tedious stuff off your plates and have an operating at a higher level, plus technology just zoomed and just went nuts for our chat dbt4o. Just imagine what's going to be available in six months from now. But nothing to be afraid of. Nobody's going to replace anybody and anything. Well, some people will go to a place, but for anybody that works strategically and understands leverage and levers, these are just levers, massive, powerful levers. And if you rather than come from place it and just go cruise control, right?
00:32:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Because that's where you die.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just go, okay, how can I leverage what's new? How can I leverage what's new? And just kind of put it into your foundational and fundamental system and process. It's going to be amazing. Like the conversation we're going to have from a year from now. Crazy, crazy, in a good way. Yeah.
00:32:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, you know, it's like I was thinking this week, I don't know if it was this morning or yesterday morning, but it's like, I'm really excited about this tea project. And I started, started dreaming a little bit, just thinking, like, man, what if this like, what if this works? And I usually, I, uh, I try, like, whenever I do that, like the voice in my head will kick in and be like, don't get too excited, like just don't get too excited. And, um, and I do that kind of just self protection, you know, I'm like, if it doesn't work, like I don't costs. Yeah. And Brian's that way. I've gotten a lot of that from him, as well. And, but at the same time, like, I was like, it's really cool. If this, if this worked, and there's, there's a model out there with this guy, Charles Livingston, who started Life Boost Coffee. And he's, he's now, he just launched a, uh, a line of teas. And so was like, and John is, he's good buddies with Charles and actually had a call with him a couple months ago saying I'm starting a tea business and Charles gave him some advice about what they learned when they were growing life-boost coffee and so I feel like we're following this like there's space in the market for this and we just got to, I don't know, I saw it work in to Lee's audience and we just got to figure out the right way to talk about it and I think we've got a good initial first step to put out there and I love that we're starting with doing upsells, going right after people, right after they buy in a sort of related... angle, I guess, and AI has been tremendously helpful on the research side of things. I started using this perplexity.ai because it gives you sites sources and links to But I just go in there and be like, give me some studies on how Joglin helps with weight loss.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know you can go do that with chat GPT-40 and get a great answer. Oh, really?
00:35:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, yeah.
00:35:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll try that. I'm pretty much canceling everything now.
00:35:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. yeah, it's like, this is amazing. Isn't so much faster and so yeah, I'm really excited. I had about tea and I think like, man, wouldn't it be cool if, because like doing this stuff with, you know, consulting with Tim, like it's, it's fine, like I'm learning. It's good to practice that muscle. I'm writing a lot of copy and it's for a different audience. And I'm getting paid well, which I can just, you know, me a big shovel or a decent shovel to pay down my debt and all that good stuff. But, you know, it's, it's still like being dependent on somebody else and, I mean, some make sense same with, with Brian, but the one thing with, with Brian is that I am really looking forward to having this event that we're going to do in January. Like, I think that's going to bring in a lot of new memory. first accelerator. so I am pumped for that. And by that time, you know, the T will be out there and have that run in and be really cool.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it could be really cool. it. When's the last time you will actually hold on to something that you're I did it. Oh, when did you update it?
00:37:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Last week.
00:37:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're looking at the wrong one. Oh, yeah, we had a 2024 and I don't know where it is. Let's see. There it is. All right, let's see. So aside, good. And then where is your, let's see. I'm gonna put your for like paying off your deck kind of thing in this schedule.
00:38:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, so that I've got all the cards there and then below I've got them all listed out.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But have you, because they look mostly empty for like, I see city for me, but what you should do is put the projected what you want to drop on those for those months coming up.
00:38:29 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay, well, I guess that line 18 set aside that 3k, it's for B of A. Okay. So I mean, I guess.
00:38:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And is there anything else that needs to get paid on those months?
00:38:51 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yes, I'm glad you said that because I was just thinking about this. Just the, so I need the. update the business expense number because that needs to include, I have one card that's paying business expenses that comes out every month and then, so that would be off the top before taxes. So I think that 1800 would go to, I just paid it, was 1100, and that's the minimum payment on the, it's the biz, biz affire.
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, here's what I think you should do, and I think you should do it with whatever's rough idea in your head right now. But do you want to drop on any of these accounts for these next few months? So you have a more accurate idea of what there really is to work with. Because it helps with the surprises or the disappointment of a letdown kind of at the end. We're like, that's not as good as that looks right there. Or it could be like, oh, actually, well, I've got this to work with. So here's what I want to do now. And maybe it's paying down more. Maybe it's investing in something, whatever. So when you end, and it helps you get to those targets that you want to get with your finances faster when you put all of that in there. I'll have this, but I'll have my investment account. I'll have everything, all in a snapshot. So I look at the end of month projection knowing. like, this is the money that's growing, this is the money that's like investments growing, and then the revenue from business, and then here's the personal expenses and the businesses. I put everything together so I have an overall snapshot of what all the finances are. Since I don't, I like, I have a company, but I don't have a company, you know what I mean? I have that structure, so eventually, you know, like I have hired three people, I'm probably gonna hire a couple more for my own business, so this year I'm definitely gonna have to structure differently and have separate, completely separate finances, I haven't been doing that up until now, so it's really been super helpful for me to have everything on one page to have an idea, especially when I was first trying, when I was trying to get out of debt, that was huge for me to be able to see everything in a single line and be really confident about how much I had. how much I would have like what what work was coming doing obviously you don't know for sure but I've always had a pretty consistent revenue amount so um doing that just the piece of mind that comes from with the clarity but the energy from like yes I'm here and so if I go sell another thing it's extra money to go do this with or that with or whatever you know is that all I'm just one sheet or do you have multiple sheets so I have a I have a tab it's called monthly expenses and so that's everything that comes out and I have it color coded for business or personal just so I know and so what I do is I copy and paste that every month to my monthly budget and so like as each week I update it I'm like okay all of those charges have come out here's what's left that's an alignment with what it predicted I would have by the end of the the month, I just keep tabs on that and make sure that, you know, I'm just looking at it once a week and making sure everything comes out. So, and then on that tab that has a summary of all the things, that's where I make edits. But my main tab, my summary tab, like you have right here, what I do is I have that monthly stuff, so in the beginning of the month, I copy and paste the whole month playlist, right? So it has my variable and my fixed expenses, fixed expenses are, well, they're on the top, but then I end up sorting it by the date that they get drafted, just so that I have it in a linear kind of, what's the word, timeline, chronological order. But then they're also color coded too, and at the bottom it adds it all up as a summary of these are the things that are going to get drafted out. And that gets taken away from the monthly total of what I know is going to come in business. revenue-wise. My investment accounts don't get included in that.
00:44:03 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They're there so I can see it, but they don't get into my cash accounts.
00:44:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They just stay there. They don't get touched. Then at the top, I have a column for all of my different bank accounts, savings, checking, different banks. I do put the investment accounts in there, so I have a total, but it's not the total that everything gets subtracted from, if that makes sense. It gets its own total of all my assets, and then there's the this is the monthly budget total that everything can be debited from, and so that's the thing that changes every month. So I do have everything in there on a single page. The income prediction is its own tab, so I have an expense tab and an income tab. And I have an income for every year, and I just create because I don't have a ton of people or ton of offers, right? But either way, it wouldn't be too much different than this. It'd be a little bit longer. It's really long, but so every time there's the monthly, I used to have the group stuff and I used to have different products, which is about to return. So I would put the totals based on either the client or the product total and report those weekly or as whenever I did the update. So for clients, it's once a month. If it's going to be a product, I'll probably do it once a month total with that. Again, that's how I used to do it. And then so I got the monthly total, but it's going top to bottom and it's a really long. I don't know how many rows it is. And at the bottom, and I just do it for the whole year and one in one. tab and then it totals it at the bottom and so I've got an income tab, I've got an expense tab and the front tab, this one is my summary tab where I just copy and paste the expenses. The income is just a formula that adds up everything from my income tab so that it's calculating in real time what is coming in and what's going out is it's always right on alignment with what I have, it's always within my budget. If something changes and a new expense is coming, I just go insert a cell into the summary tab and it does that so yeah it's I could give you and I feel like I template for let's see what you know. what that looks like if you wanted to do it so that you could just kind of track. So like it's it's all the different types of expenses, school expenses, kid expenses, soccer stuff, whatever, all the personal stuff, and then all of the business stuff. So I have a really accurate idea of what's coming out every month. And I always have more money than I thought I did because I try to put in that buffer, especially for groceries, clothes, you know, things like that. Right. Yeah, but that way there was just no negative surprises. It was always a good surprise. Like, oh, I have got more money than I thought it did. And then it gets to a point where you don't necessarily have to check it every week, but it's still a good practice to do because you want to make sure that there's something didn't pop up that you weren't paying attention to.
00:47:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that'd be great. I think you you probably shared either that or maybe earlier version of that. with me in the past, let's see maybe, but but yeah, I'd love to see it and see if I could because I'm going in here and updating this and it's been helpful. So yeah, if there was way to to make it even more detailed, they'll begin.
00:48:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that. I've got it open. I have a template, but I would change it a little bit to be more like the format that I have. It's similar. Okay. Yeah.
00:48:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, I mean, you could zero everything out and send me what you use if you.
00:48:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's basically like that, but I might be able to make it just more like for for what you have. So then it's more plug and play for you. Okay. So let's see, let's look at this. I mean, because let's see, so June doesn't have a lot of wiggle around. You're at the end of May is that like what you have in profits after everything, including paying things down.
00:49:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, no, I've got more than that. I put 11 grand for lights on cost because we're doing a trip. Guys up to New York. So, but I know right now I've got um, let's see, let me just pay, let me do it. Yeah, I checked in there, I had 29 grand in my account, it's the end of the month, then I just took out five on a, on my southwest car, because that was the, because I have expenses that are tight expenses on that. And so that's part of what Brian pays me, I just pay that towards, so, okay, so we're down to like 22, probably about 20 grand sitting in there now, not 12, and I'm not going to be taking out 8 grand between now and the end of the month. So I think instead of that 12 that's going to carry over, it's going to be more like. It'll end up being more like 17.
00:51:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you've got the live payout for TxL, and then that'll happen again in October?
00:51:18 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:51:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You had a happening in October.
00:51:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you haven't mentioned profit partners at all? Yes. you working on it?
00:51:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, I'm not. It just kind of went to the back burner for me after doing that. But after doing the cohort, I didn't really like, I mean, I would do the cohort differently. So that's not like a reason to not do it, but, and I stopped, have an email my list in a while, somebody asked me about that, they're like, I haven't heard from you, and I wrote back, was like, I don't. I don't know, I don't know what I'm leading people toward, because the things that I'm excited about are, you know, the things I'm working on, and the, the, the business and things like that. And it's like, I, I don't know, like, I, I just kind of lost. energy around building my list, mailing my list, lost the energy around profit partners. And I think when I because I started, I mean, started working on the T back early and beginning of the year. And if I were to hold up, you know, option one of having like owning a business, it's generating revenue that's, you know, product based like the T versus doing something that's more personality based like profit partner. I'm I'm going to go for the product base one.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what if what you do is make it less hands-on? Like it doesn't have to be a bootcamp and instead it's just a series of videos and it's mostly self-paced and it's lower cost but it's just an engine that runs and maybe once a quarter you do a live call, live training and it's kind of a big deal, you know, like really get like some speakers on there, maybe it's like a four-hour kind of event but it can be in alignment with other things that you're doing, other people that you're working with so it's not a separate thing that takes separate energy. It's a it's a duplicated repurposed type of activity right because you're already talking to these people, they're already in your share and you can be like, hey, let's talk about the stuff that we're doing and let's show people how they can do it. And, you know, like, there's probably an angle because there's value in it. And I think you liked talking about it. I just think you, and this is the thing I found in my own self, a start, stop, start, stop. And I do it with a lot of different things, fitness regimens, different types of habits and activities, because I know that I'm pulled to it and I'm called to it. But when I start to do it, the path isn't super clear. And so I think sometimes God just shows me things so that I'm ready, so that when the time is right, I'll know it and recognize it because I've been thinking about it. And my subconscious has been able to work on it. And he's been attracting other people into my sphere and attracting me into theirs. like, there's all these things that go into it. And so maybe, so in the beginning, the burden was kind of I had have to have a product to make my own money so I'm not reliant just on TxL. Well now you've got T and now you have a consulting job that you're kind of doing and liking and you can do another one or two and easily make another $10,000 where with Trad GBT you wouldn't be spending a ton of time because you know how to train it really really fast on their stuff. So everything has changed but this is still something that you probably want to be able to give back. You have always been drawn to helping other people be successful in their own businesses being free, being liberated from not being taken advantage of by people that they're working for that they're making rich and they're not getting paid anything. So maybe it's a change of schedule and burden and the way that you package everything and how you offer it and you just pivot kind of an adjust the way that you're delivering it the way that you're selling it and even your price point like if you don't need it to work you don't need it to be a certain price point and so you know what I mean like maybe that's something to consider so that now it's not a well I have to do this and I feel resentment because of it and it's a I get to do this I'm going to do it my way just like every other deal that you've done right yeah with John and his son John right the tea guy yeah John John John you've you've adjusted the partnership with Brian every conversation that you're having you're like okay well here's what I'm willing to do it's on the table, take it or leave it. And you can do the same thing with profit partners, but if you're feeling like, okay, they can't pay that much because they really don't have good arrangements yet. They don't have good partnerships yet. not, really they have a lot of mindset issues probably like you did about how they even positioned themselves. So this is a very long runway.
00:58:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's the biggest problem with this.
00:58:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not really a problem, but it is in terms of conversion. Is there is a long runway of overcoming mental hurdles of, I can't do this. I don't know how to package it. I don't know how to whatever. And so you could come up with a 90 day email sequence with chat GPT. So like you could go take all of your recordings, all of your transcripts. then, so this is what I've done. And I love the memory because I could start a whole new chat and it still remembers everything I've told it and other things. So, give it all of that content and say, this is my philosophy. This is my goal. This is what I want to teach people. Here's the problem that I know is that, you know, for example, it took me years to get to the point where I can confidently just say, look, this is what I'm going to do, take it or leave it. But on top of that, you also sharpened your saw. You also got to the point where you're like, I'm very good at what I do. You you can write copy, amazing copy. don't have to write, wait for Brian, Brian's barely going to touch and tweak anything you write anymore. So it wasn't just, you know, your mindset, it was also your skill set. Yeah. So you tell chat TPT, like, these are the issues that people are going to have and you think about all the issues they're going to have. And maybe, you know, at two o'clock in the morning, you're up, you're going to the bathroom, think of like, whatever. Don't let me forget it. Let's add this to the material. Let's add this to to the philosophy and make sure that we leave it into the content and I've been talking to it like that and it will weave it into the content and say oh this will fit perfect in this chapter and we'll add this lead magnet we could do this and I'm like oh yeah let's go yeah so you know you could say I need a 90 day or maybe it's a 120 day and then you recycle it right thing that just hit all of these bullet points consistently and tells them this is what you need to know and let's make it anecdotal which is not really great at coming up with anecdotes without training and even with training it's not very great at anecdotes I don't think not the way that I would write not the way that you would write but it can it definitely can be trained better and I'm we're getting there anyway but but then you can just redo it every 90 to 120 days and you know in four months maybe you get the next level and say, hey, do you feel like you're ready for the next step? And let them either unsubscribe, stay in and they recycle through the next thing, the same thing over and over again. Or at some point, they raise their hand and say, I'm interested in more. And it's either buy this thing, or now you're self selected to more. So I'm going to give you the next level of mindset. And eventually, they're either going to unsubscribe or buy. Because the what you should be doing for a list hygiene is getting rid of people who never open your emails, right? So that's what I would do. And it's very low level. And the training could all be video plus you want to have a but if they do, and you get an extra two, three, four, $5,000 a month, talk. talking about profit partners one on one, which is, to me, the thing that would energize you, and also potentially bring you your own profit partner, because who knows who they're connected to? Um, you know, maybe that's another way that you could do it where it's not draining anymore. And with the automations of chat TPT, may I not allow work?
01:02:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm open to something like that. It's, um, yeah, I'm open to something like that. But it, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like, like, not, I'm not drawn to put energy into it, like right at this juncture.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, anybody anything around profit partners?
01:02:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do I know?
01:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, then we'll just let it sit, you don't You don't have to do anything, but if you if you get inclined and you think about it And then you can just start building a framework and chat GPT I haven't even run into limitations since 4o came out.
01:03:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Mm-hmm.
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not running out of topians Didn't tell me I couldn't upload X amount of things I've had to continue like a couple times, but that's it because it just goes so long. It's so amazing. Yeah I'm just like that's a huge upgrade. Yeah, amazing for $20 a month.
01:03:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like that's crazy.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I know So it looks like okay, I What are you and Seth and Brian working on anything?
01:03:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not yet It's balls in my court to outline The RFM what Seth and I talked about doing was taking people through I guess his email process to the outcome will be to have a, to show them how to find the best people on their list and then we're going to give them an offer to run to their list. So, what were a, a structure of an offer that they would plug in, basically, and we would sell TXL this way because we would say, basically we've, we've shown you how to find the very best people on your list. Now we're giving you, we're just saying, run this, run this offer, run this offer structure, making money, and use that money to join TxL. like pay for TxL before you join type of thing.
01:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And so it's just in my court to finish outlining that, show it to Brian, or I want to show it to Seth first, but that's where it sits. And then Seth told me, I guess you were on the call, actually now that I think about it with this as a hypnosis.
01:05:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, it's kind of self hypnosis therapy, and it combines other existing therapies, like CBT cognitive therapy. Yeah, so he's working on an offer for them right now.
01:05:49 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We had a sales call with them Friday.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's right. And they kind of balked at the price a little bit for a dent for you. But it was a big price. And I told Seth that he should do But because he's making big impact in big companies, and every time it's blowing them away and he's charging peanuts basically for something that's gonna add a whole lot to their bottom line. And he's at the point where he needs to build a team and make some investments so that I've got something to work with for him. But also it's pretty powerful. And I wanna see it in more people's businesses that actually have transformational offerings. So like the way that you teach people you personally, but also in TXL, how to be better leaders, be better persuaders, move people from where they are to where they have already said they wanna go through copy, through persuasion, through buying this thing, which is a transformational thing. TXL is a transformational thing. You come in and you improve your skills, which relates to, you know, correlates to and translates to better revenue. But also more confidence. And more confidence brings more energy. Just it feels better. You know, you're happier when you're more confident. If you're self-doubting, you're unhappy. That's just how it is. So with the way that he writes things, compared with the automations that take that psychology and that writing on a schedule with behavioral-based responses, it's like consulting and coaching somebody in person on a day to day. It feels very different.
01:07:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
feels so much more personal.
01:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's architecture and it's engineering. this is not how anything is really running right now. And, but if a person wants to be leading and wants to be really supportive, and they don't want to show up every day to do it because we also have our own lives, this is the solution. And I want to see it in businesses because if you put all those things together, that means you've got more people with more skills and more confidence going out and doing their things. You know what they don't have? They don't have the fear that the government's going to take over them or whatever person. They're less afraid. They're more powerful than more independent. That goes with so many of the other values that we have is wanting to be a free people, self-sustaining, independent, whatever. Free parents, happier parents, stronger, more confident parents that can go home and teach our kids how to do all of these things. So it um but nobody else is doing it so I'm definitely like whatever you can do to get that in there and start seeing it happen I think that you have the ability to go take the same kind of concept and put it into other things like once you see how it works you'll I know you have this skill technically and copy and persuasion rise to go and do something like this in other things ethically obviously not stealing the formula but it's the type of thing that it's going to get out there you know and you use it and repurpose it but there's abundance Seth will get what he needs and wants plenty um but once you see it I think it can really change the way that you operate and really leverage things for you because you'll look at that and go this is this is what I do you with profit partnering this is how I walk somebody through an experience and I don't have to be there for them but they they're like I'm in love with Chris because he has taught me everything He's my coach. He's my mentor. He's my teacher. He changed my life. And you're like, yeah, wrote those emails once.
01:10:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, you're not going to see really how it all works until you, you watch it. He built inside of something. So if you get the framework, this is leverage that you will benefit over and over again. That the Titans can as well, but that you and Brian will, you know, share the cost or however that works. Yeah. It'll be something you can even potentially do with teeth and that the transformation is a person who doesn't know a lot about how the nervous system works, right? The digestive system or whatever. And so you walk them through these things and like if they raise their hand and say, look, I want to be the healthiest person. And I can't, well, if you're gonna do that, you can't just take supplements. You have to understand how these things work. So let's walk you through an experience where you learn all of these things, and then you make some decisions, well guess what those decisions are? Buying your products, but it's buying your products because you've done the research and you know that if they've got these things going on, this is the ideal thing for them. So it's persuasion, I wouldn't call it manipulation because the manipulation is getting somebody to do something that they would not do that is against their values. But they got twisted into doing something against their values, tricked basically. To me, you know, that's what it is. Persuading somebody to do something they wanna do and just continuing to encourage them and given the information that they need to do that, you know, that's ethical and good. I think that that's what this is for. So anyway, this is my pitch and plug for, get that. Don't overwork yourself, know, if you're busy and now is not a good time. That's one thing But I see powerful leverage in you seeing what he's done. I mean, he has not been great about Explaining how powerful it is and being clear about it But he's like in the same way that when you went through BAM Your copy just just Yeah, he has been having that transformation as we've been working because we've been working together It's been 13 months now and he could not tell me anything clearly and now he can put it in just a few words and a few paragraphs Which it used to take him hours, and I still didn't know everything I needed to know. Yeah, so Once now that he's getting clear, it's it's gonna be coming out and it's it's hopefully gonna get some traction because this is This is the thing many of us have been needing who don't want to be tied to the job, tied to the community, tied to social media, tied to email, tied to customer support, but also know that a person needs to be reminded, needs to be held accountable, needs to be given bite-sized pieces all the way through. Nobody wanted to write all those email sequences. So this aligning with where we're at with chat TPT. Forget about it. I'm telling you, God is like, babies, I know you're tired, I got this for you.
01:13:38 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's on my list. I make just slow process on it, so it's not an empty document somewhere. just require some thinking. Simple. I mean, I guess it is a simple topic, but.
01:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could I return to you.
01:14:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what I know. What else? What questions do you have? Let it ask you questions because that's what you and I do. I ask you questions and you answer it. And you're like, well, that actually brings up a good idea. Let me think about this. And then it evolves.
01:14:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Right.
01:14:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't let that ABT replace me because I'm better, but you know, but you can do it. It can it can probe and do something. And matter of fact, the way that my copy evolved was that and it was crazy because. So I went through and I was making a lead magnet for. Principles and priorities. And I had just told it the importance of. That the reason it's, it's the first. concept in the first pillar that I teach is because values, principles and values, they inform priority and priority informs what gets done and what gets measured. And that obviously is going to inform what we actually have and so then it goes through and it goes the secret way to like how I'm going to go read it. I'm just going to do this normal wrap up. Someone is just crazy. Tick tock marketing strategies is where we ended up writing this I think. I gave it bunch of notes after that. going Oh, you know what actually I sent it to some of that. But it was, yeah, no, I really, I do really want to tell you this show this. I had to scroll up past the billions of conversations that we have. Okay, it was after our ball of reality. never mind. I'm just priority. So no one cares. That's how I can find it because I told it no one cares. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. Okay, so it wrote this. It said title, the surprising key to unlocking your business potential, how core values transform your priorities. And I was like, nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's not good at all. What people care about is actually getting traction and momentum in their business and they feel stuck. I'm pretty sure you have enough understanding about human emotion to be able to write better than this. What questions do you need to ask yourself? People are writing to make sure that you are writing something that will evoke powerful emotion So it asked the questions six of them. What are the primary pain points of my audience? Then it asked another question, and then what emotions are tied to the pain point? What transformation are they seeking? What's the immediate benefit they will gain from my solution? How can I create urgency in the sense of importance? What proof of credibility can I provide and then? The new copy it did not ask you questions. It did not answer it It answered itself and then wrote the copy without any further interaction for me The new title unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack Introduction feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks announcing progress. You're not alone Most business owners struggle with the same issues feeling like they're spinning their rails without getting any traction The good news is there's a simple yet powerful solution that can change everything in just minutes So I have taught it that stuff but it doesn't matter because in the past I taught it so many things and it won't pull from it and it won't take the psychology that I had taught it and it didn't put it into copy like it just it took so much training and this I like what I just told you like nobody cares blah blah whatever I would go 20 rounds and still not get anything great but what it did right there one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve word headline unlock the secret to breaking free from business stagnation a simple five-minute hack um I will read the rest of that next is feeling stuck in your business overwhelmed by endless tasks oh mama keep reading you know what I mean mm-hmm so um but where it started where is it started like unlocking your priorities give her a brat there else I'm out there
01:19:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
that's awesome.
01:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, simple turning and oh, so the conversation, that's all I was saying, like to your outline for RFM.
01:19:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is how I talked to it. And, know, I don't it doesn't care about its feelings, but I want to do it was important. It wasn't being rude. Nobody cares about transforming their priorities. That's the truth. And so I said, that's not a good headline at all. What people care about it. And then what questions do you need to ask yourself to make sure that you evoke powerful emotion? Because I told it, people purchase and make decisions based off of emotion. So if you give it the principles that you know that copy has to have and say, remember this, always remember this. Never forget this. That type of thing.
01:19:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It will start remembering.
01:20:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then you can say, okay, based on what you already know, what questions do you have that you need to know before knowing that this is something you need? Or what questions do you think my buyer has that they need to have a clear answer to before they purchase? And then it will give you some questions, you're like, oh yeah, you're right. So I need to go put this in there. I'm telling you, it will walk you through the whole process and the way that we have done in some sessions, in copywriting sessions, you'll get there, but you can stop and start whenever you want to. And you can say, I forgot what we were working on, remind me, and it will tell you the last conversation you had anywhere in any of the conversations.
01:20:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Wow, that's awesome. Yeah, I'm definitely going to do that for the SARS-Fins thing. That's great.
01:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. I suppose you probably had enough of talking to me after I let you go.
01:20:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's good to catch up. Um, yeah, I mean, maybe we could, uh, connect like this or like once a month or something.
01:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love that, but I would, it would really be great to me to just at least be able to touch faces at least every couple of weeks. would rather just kind of weakly like, Hey, this is what's good. Like, tell me the wins or if something is stressing you out, I really would like to know about that. Like I'm so if we did the, like this is the offer I'm wanting to test and try and I think won't be hard, especially because people like you tend to just not say anything. So it's really not taking my time when I would give it, um, but especially if something stressing you out, just get it out and just be like this. And then maybe I can ask you questions, maybe I can give you encouragement, just be here. Sometimes it's just nice to have somebody that knows your business and knows you.
01:21:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Just really that.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also if you have a win, it's something that will feed into whatever else we're doing because that win is definitely going to have relationship to other work that you're doing. So if you would just take a second, a few minutes, whatever, to pop in each week, if I'm like, how's it going? Tell Tina, what's up? Boy, I've been investing you for six and a half years also.
01:22:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's not one way. I know, I know.
01:22:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
care about you. I want to see, I want to know that you're okay in doing well. And I want to celebrate with you when you're doing awesome, but you are doing awesome.
01:22:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hear you. I get it.
01:22:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. I'm not great about it. It's always the calls were always helpful because it's like on the calendar. Yeah. Like, I got to be there, the, you know, voice notes or whatever it is. It's like, I'll do that. Well, let's put that in minute.
01:22:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can put it on the calendar. Hey, checking with Tina.
01:22:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So you see that pop up and you're like, okay, Tina gets five minutes. I'm going to give her an update. can do that on our Wednesday time slot.
01:23:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay well then I will put that on there and it's an invite so both of us and I'm gonna look at that and go I don't see my message.
01:23:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.

I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and yes, and that has lots of value. Okay, so you're amazing. You

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool, so yeah. Oh, last night I threw a bunch in the Instant Pot, so it was brown rice chicken, broccoli, with some cream of chicken, and there's some Montreal chicken seasoning, and then some cheese in it.
00:08:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. Montreal chicken season.
00:08:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at you, Canadian, It's good.
00:08:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That sounds fantastic, actually. I normally would make that with the leftover turkey, but we also have mashed potatoes and stuffing left, so we're just having a repeat tonight. But the kiddos are gone. Amanda's on Thomas. He's doing his master's in speech pathology, and yeah, and he His girlfriend, he just started dating about eight months ago, so this is like the third week and they've come down now So it's kind of really fun having them here So we had a dinner with them on Sunday Just us and then to my family my mom and my brother and sister all and her brother stuff We had a big family and yesterday at their house It was not a good and it was funny because me and a man were talking about our eyes are always so much bigger than everything Because we went to the liquor store thinking oh we're gonna have all this booze for everyone and stuff But all this wine really nice bottles of wine like god will be ever heard of decoy that red. I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

> 00:00:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Good morning.
00:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:07 - Michael Fujinaka
How are you? It really well.
00:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's your sleep?
00:00:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I'm just putting that up here. Could have been better in the last couple of days, but. Yeah. Well, can I show you?
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
please. All right.
00:00:23 - Michael Fujinaka
You look exactly like your picture.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's good. I guess. No, I'm not. I haven't probably haven't done video. I feel really loud today. I don't know. It's just equity in my room. Oh, that's good. Actually, also, I was just thinking I would really like this to be a. Could you send these to me Sunday night so that Monday I have them? Because that's going to be an accountability test. Yeah. So you get one time to fail and then we install consequences. I understood.
00:01:04 - Michael Fujinaka
Are you able to see my screen right now?
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes I am. So I'm looking at the dates on the ora ringer at the top. I see. Yeah, and you sent those to me. So deep sleep. I'd be very interested to see, I know you broke your Apple Watch, but if you end up replacing it, I'd be very interested to compare the data. None of them are perfectly reliable. I feel like if you really want to dial into this and I'm a data person, so figuring out the way that you like to see the data, the way that it makes the most sense to you. don't like this layout. I'll Also, so the SleepWatch app that I use for Apple calls it restful sleep versus, well, so that light sleep, deep sleep is a little bit different. But I'd be interested to see how it compares. like I use sleep cycle and sleep watched. And then there's also Apple Health data and they all report differently even though they're using the same mechanism to record data to report the data differently. So there are algorithms for how they calculate the data is obviously different. So I like to look at the multiple data points and say, okay, which one makes the most sense in the correlation to how I feel and what my experience is that day. I still tend to look at all of them anyway, because I'm not and I think that you'd be okay with this too. Like my fiance, he can't look at this stuff because he'll get anxiety over it and he'll just obsess about it. And there are people who just like, they look at that and they forgot about it. I don't. I look at it and go it's information and it's probably not fully accurate and how I feel is probably a better indicator. But anyway, if you're really going to dial this in, I would recommend whatever data points you're willing to acquire apps, Apple Watch versus ordering that type of thing. And then let's have about a month, but also hear about the whole new thing into the mix with the baby. That'll be interesting to watch what happened. how is Esther, by the way, that I meant to be like, that's the first thing I want to know.
00:03:55 - Michael Fujinaka
What's she doing? She unfortunately got COVID two days on Friday. So I was. I had not had to. We shifted what we were doing so I watched Emi the last couple of days and then Emi got COVID yesterday. So we actually might tomorrow. They're actually telling us not to come to the hospital tomorrow. we might actually just push the due date back to 40 weeks instead of 39.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:04:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So it's Her mom's here now helping us. She also has COVID now.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm kind of holed up in this room today where I'll be working. How does your family do with it? Like it's not the same for everyone. For me, it was devastating, but for other people, we haven't touched them.
00:04:43 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, yeah. mean, it's, it's kind of business as usual. It's COVID. just not that it's not that potent for us right now.
00:04:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it was last time.
00:04:52 - Michael Fujinaka
So yeah, like my wife and her mom, they all cook. I mean, Emi is running around and laughing, even though she's not. So yeah, it's business as usual, except I just need more careful. At first, I wasn't careful because I was like, well, I'm not going to get it anyways. But I'm not going to have got it yet. So now we're like, well, we don't want to start your timer right now. Like if I get it, then I get it for 10 days, I think that. So now we're like, okay, well, maybe I should be careful now too. So we'll see, I still might get it.
00:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
going to test this morning, actually. Yeah, business as usual sort of. Well, that's good. It was I have, as I've been hospitalized, I told you, I think hospitalized with it four times for seven to 10 days, and my oxygen was max levels and I have narrow airways, my right lungs almost like so COVID was a big deal for me. And then it totally messed up my digestive system. But it's so interesting how it's different for everyone. But anyway, learned a lot of healing over that too. Okay, so sleep stuff. Oh, We're not sharing screen anymore. I'm like, what happened? I can't see it anymore. It's good. So Sunday nights just email me send those images and your journal, I would really like to see. So I'm just doing it in like a written format. Well, you can take a picture of it if you want to, or you can use an app like whatever works. But for if we're going to even talk about this, then I want to really talk about it because otherwise it makes no sense. And so food, exercise, sunshine, sleep, mood, and anything that you might have done differently in the day that would impact that you noticed. And how you feel about the sleep, your energy that day. Let's do scale of one to 10 on productivity mood. Um, me highlight this too. So I give it note. Productivity, mood, energy, and kind of notice when you start to fade out a little bit throughout the day, let's check that. And if we watched that for a few weeks, again, wild card with the baby, like this is a whole different thing. But you still should learn some of the patterns of your body and what things make the biggest impact and what things, you know, really aren't. And then, then you'll have, you'll be aware of your own levers. So if, for example, some days, there's a lot that I need to get done. my, and I'm sleepy, I'm not well functioning, and it might be eight o'clock at night, and I might use caffeine, because I'm in the middle of deep brainwork. my cognitive function will improve with that. But my sleep will be so sacrificed. But if if the priority for that day, and I have the lead way the next day to be able to take a nap or something like that, in order to, because also I'm a finisher, so I need to complete something. Otherwise, I won't go to sleep, that those loops will be open to my brain, and I won't be able to rest and relax anyway. So since I know my sleep is already going to be disrupted, I'm just going to power through. But the next day, I will get almost nothing done brain level wise. I may be able to get some things done physically. So then I'll do some housework. That might be when I spend a little bit more time just sitting outside relaxing, because I'm soaking in the sunshine, because that's still productive. My body needs it. It's good for my hormones, all of those types of things. So every day isn't the same. But every day is planned and leveraged according to what I know about how my body operates. My brain operates. according to the things that I want to accomplish at that
00:09:00 - Michael Fujinaka
makes sense. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Like on July, what was it that night that I got 17 minutes of deep sleep? I guess it was July to 3rd when I woke up. Yeah, I got it was awful that day. I was like in a haze in a days and you know, there's a couple of times in the night, Emmy woke up twice screaming in the night. So I got up at I think one and then I got up again at 4.30. And yeah, it just destroyed me on Wednesday. And then Wednesday night, tried to get to sleep. But you know, I could see that I got it. I started my sleep routine at 9.30. I remember you said your sleep routine takes about an hour. Yeah, it does take me about an hour to wind down. I take a shower, put on my lotion or whatever, brush my teeth, write my journal. And by the time I actually lay down, it's about, yeah, it is about 10.30.
00:09:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, it's about 90 minutes, actually. 60 to 90 minutes. 60 if I'm exhausted. 90 at the least, otherwise, sometimes it's two hours, but if we're talking about the whole sleep hygiene thing, the like washing base, brushing teeth, I pray and kind of meditate, saying good night to the girls, closing up the house, like to me that's a whole part of the winding down. And then I'm so, but that's not part of the 90 minutes. Once I get in bed, that's the 60 to 90 minutes. So like the brushing the teeth, all that stuff, I'm talking about just being in bed. That's usually the 60 to 90 minutes, 90 on a bad day, 60 on a good day. And there I'm listening to something or reading or I have a mindless kind of game that I play because it's like I still have energy in my body, so I'm not ready to just and but because it's mindless, I don't have to, I'm not using my my brain to solve things. Um, yeah, anyway, so So that whole thing and I discovered that just going through lots of different things. can't read books if I read a book I want to know what's next. I have to finish it. I have to complete it. I can't put things down. I can I don't like to It's not relaxing to me. So I can't do that, but I can listen to scriptures because I've read them so many times. already know how they end anyway, but it's also It's the narrator. There's all these different things that I've learned About how my brain responds interacts engages or doesn't can't listen to music cuz wants to follow the pattern All of these things and I'm paying attention to everything that comes into it. So anyway, just learning that type of stuff And and that's why I really want you to notice like in the journal the next day. So what was your routine life? What? that you do before you went to bed. But what you'll find is that it's really difficult to, you can't create the same thing every single day, especially as a parent. And so knowing what the levers are and mostly just getting up in the day, recognizing how you feel, taking into account the things that you have to do that day. But I also like to take stock of what has to happen throughout the week. What we can talk about time blocking as soon as we start to get into this business stuff, which I'd like to talk about today. But it's kind of evaluating the, I'll call them big rocks. I don't know if you've ever heard of Stephen Covey. Stephen Covey, a Franklin Covey who does the organizers and the day planners and things like that.
00:12:49 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, I think I have, yeah. Evan habits of highly affected people.
00:12:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, I know that. Yeah. So he has done this great presentation, and you might have seen it because lots of people. We'll have done it, but it's you have a jar and next to the jar are sand and rocks, pebbles and bigger rocks and water. And he says, can you fit all of this into the jar? And people try to do it and it doesn't work, it won't all fit. But then he starts with a fresh jar and he puts in the big rocks first and then he puts in the smaller rocks and then he puts in the sand and then he puts in the water and everything fits in the jar. And so he said the only way that you can get everything in is by starting with the big rocks first. So that's where terminology and a lot of business stuff has come up with big rocks and it's what matters most is what you start with because even at the end of the day, let's say some of the stuff doesn't get into the jar, you got what matters most. So you kind of decide through a series of priorities, principles, values, and whatnot. of evaluating what it is that you're doing. So what are the big rocks for each business? What are the big rocks for you as a person? What are the big rocks for you as a father? And we do have some homework to come back to you with the family values.
00:14:15 - Michael Fujinaka
Hopefully you did that. I did not.
00:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, where's my notebook? Boogie. Didn't get his homework done. What kind of consequences should we have for not doing homework that you're paying for to get these results?
00:14:33 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know. What you suggest?
00:14:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's painful? And what can I hold you to? That's the thing. I have to be able to hold you to it.
00:14:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I know. have no idea. I have been doing the cool showers in the morning. That's very painful.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but that's not thing like if you're already choosing to do it It's the accountability part you need work with and so the the Consequence has to be something Inforceable ish like that the one client. He's like the only way I'm gonna do it is if you charge me money He's like a Jewish. I hate paying money Okay, so But he was the only one that was really bad at accountability. I don't really have to do it for other people But this is your thing so we've got to come up with an accountability structure for not doing that and Especially because that is a foundational element of the work that we're gonna do I need to know what the containers are Or your time and for your values throughout the week so that we can create the system But if you haven't defined it and you haven't taken the time to do that then we don't have the foundational pieces are worth it makes a lot of sense but I did tell you that last week and you still didn't do it you're right you're right all right yeah let's let's do something about that yeah that's painful to you that's what it's funny losing money is painful let's do it how painful you got you have to decide I have to decide no idea it has to be painful to you but well I know my massage is cost $90 actually yeah $90 so I think if I lose $90 I could get another nice massage that's good because now it's not you know it's not excessive but it's you can relate that to something else yeah but we're gonna do that for everything that you don't do every time you don't do it I'm gonna send you an invoice at the end of it and expect you to pay it and just, but don't do that anymore. I mean, I'll take your money if you want me to, but I'd rather you do the work because then you get the results.
00:17:12 - Michael Fujinaka
I would too, got it, I agree.
00:17:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so you owe me family homework. I'm gonna go ahead and send you an email after this as a reminder. So family goals, time. What does the day look like? And the week in terms of like, what should your weekend look like? How available are you? That type of thing. I'll go ahead and write it out a little more clearly. And I imagine Esther's gonna get you out of this by probably answering most of it for you, but that's okay, that's delegation as long as the job gets done and you agree with it. It has to be that you agree with it with then you're not, there's going to be resistance, right? So we're not going to lie to ourselves and say, yeah, this is it. And we're not going to play games and we're not going to say anything that's not true. Got it. Okay. So that and food, time, energy, mood, journal, every Sunday by 9 p.m. because I don't want you up at 8 p.m. Let's say that. I don't want you up later because of it to cram it and get it done. So it's not in my inbox by 8 p.m. on Sunday, you're late. So because I don't, I don't want you staying up late to do it to avoid consequences. Everything about what we do together is going to be engineered. to improve and help you stay within the things that you've you said are important to you.
00:19:06 - Michael Fujinaka
So I did read the book or I'm listening to the book switch and that concept is in that book where it says you have to shape the path and make it easy for the elephant to go down the path. So yeah, if I didn't even pay attention to that part, I didn't realize that was in the book. Yeah, interesting, like this is a path, right? It's like you're making me do it at 8 p.m. so that I'm not tempted to stay up late to finish my homework, which I know I'll do. And so that will force me to start the homework earlier to get it done by hate.
00:19:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I want you to pay attention to too, in terms of like people that you work with and whatever, this is our third conversation. I already knew I had to do that with you.
00:19:55 - Michael Fujinaka
Because I'm paying attention to you.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it. So that's important. If you're going to work with that is helping you with anything. They got to be paying attention to you. Last week you were saying it was new somebody listening to you and and working on like what matters to you and what's So I want you to continue to see the evidence of what that is rather than you just telling you, hey, Fuji, we're going to talk about you and it's going to be about you, but really it's not about you.
00:20:23 - Michael Fujinaka
So I didn't see my notes on this and I thought you were going to forget about the family goals. So yeah, no, it's good.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not here to forget. I'm not paid to forget. I'm here to get results and I'm competitive. So I plan on doing a good job for you. That's what I do. I love it. Okay, so actually, where's my notes?
00:21:00 - Michael Fujinaka
Can I think of how the rock and the sand and the pebble thing fits what it said in switch was that you know that someone had like a bunch of loans that to pay off and it was interesting switch was advocating that you start with the small goals that you could beat out quickly. But I guess in that is just one example that maybe like to fit it in the same scheme as you know if you have a big rock that you need to fit in you still need to figure out how to like you know like you can't just tackle the big rock I mean you can but go after the big rock in a way that gives you small victories so that that kind of makes sense to me is that you know getting early small victories will get the buy-in to keep going.
00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and this is why I talk about levers and leverage because what works for you one day may not work for you another day because of your energy so going back. to the finite willpower also and the fact that you've got to battle your brain for some things. So let's say you've got a big rock but you can't get yourself to do it. So one of the things I do and I'm working on creating a course for it because I want to teach this to more people but I only have I take very few one-on-one clients but it's a time evaluator and of all the things that I've had people do and we will do this it has been the most kind of eye-opening pivotal exercise that we have and it's a simple spreadsheet and we track everything that you do for a couple weeks. Really it works ideally if we do it for a few weeks because there's so much variety in the tasks generally for especially for CEOs entrepreneurs because we're all over the place. So what we do is track everything that's being done throughout your day, period, personal, whatever, obviously within reason, we don't need our personal personal personal stuff. But then you, you categorize things according to profitability, to skill level, like is it something you're really good at? Something you really bad out, bad out, where's the spectrum? Energizing versus draining, necessary versus, so how much time do we spend doing things that are neither profitable nor necessary? We find those things that go, do you, out of your 24 hours in a day, effectively maybe 13, 14 hours a day, is that really where you want to spend it? And, right, but also, as you start to look at it, what has been, Just really kind of eye-opening for people is how little time they spend on the most profitable activities Um, and then the other thing is finding out what are the things that are necessary? Are semi-profitable, but they're foundational Meaning that they have to happen in order for the profitable activities to happen and that could be bookkeeping things like that So in those things that are draining um not First position profitable, but secondary profitable or necessary in some way um There's two things that we'll do so when possible we delegate And so hire an expert always an expert because if it's not an autonomous expert In that seat taking care of that thing for you you still have to put mental energy on it Managing them. Did you do it right? Whatever so we don't be cheap when it comes to delegation We get leaders as much as as possible, balancing out how much it costs, obviously, but trying to, I'm always managing energy most with zero energy. I could have all the money in the world. If I don't have any energy, what am I going to do with it? I can't enjoy it. I can't leverage it. I can't figure out how to manage it because I'm too tired. So we always manage energy first, which is why I love that sleep was your primary goal and focus that you wanted it to work on. So anyway, but if there are things that are profitable and necessary and you currently don't have anybody that you could delegate it to, but it's either you're not great at it or it's draining. So the stuff that has to get done that sucks. We'll just call it that way, right? So energy silences. I call them energy silences when you sandwich something that you, that is energizing and good and it doesn't have to be business it doesn't have to be a rock it could be breakfast it could be a walk it could be cuddles it could be anything that puts energy into you then you do the thing that sucks and you've already planned what you're doing afterwards and you've planned a cut-off time so the cut-off time could be either a very specific time or a easily predictable ending point meaning like in an hour roughly i should be done with this particular part of it right so let's say you are like me and you need to close the loop you're not going to cut off when there's a few more minutes left of it you're going to you just want to complete it so if you can tell that there is a you know an ending point choose that and then when you're done you're done and you immediately go to the good energy thing but mentally you already know you're looking forward to that you already know there's something good that's coming right after this you and it resets your energy, resets your mood and that actually so of the energy sandwiches you you want these especially when this thing sucks but is really necessary you really want these to be potent whatever they are and almost always I want the ending part of the sandwich to be a physical activity because the stress that goes into your body when you're doing that difficult thing you want to release that you want to literally work it out of you so walk, gym, exercise, something but you want to be moving as much as possible so I'll show you what that looks like and we will do that but not right now let's see okay let me go oh I did that's what I was pulling up all right you ready to start talking about the business stuff
00:28:01 - Michael Fujinaka
I'm already, uh, I'm already behind on the sleep and everything. just, uh, pack it on and just nervous about what we're going to do. Let's do it.
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. We're digging in. Yeah. Um, okay. So I'm looking at, I'm ranking things based on the hours that you said that you work eight to 11 days per month, Q and E. Yeah. And how many hours in those eight to 11 days per month? Uh, a week. I mean, a day roughly.
00:28:41 - Michael Fujinaka
pretty much in general, we try to craft those days to fill up clients. So I usually depart at about 730, like I'm leaving the house at 730. I drive maybe an hour. Try taking Uber now because I'm And then I, yeah, it's pretty much all day that I'm working. May I show you a calendar?
00:29:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Anything you want to share, the more information I have, the better.
00:29:17 - Michael Fujinaka
Okay. So, let's see if I can pull this up here. Screen number one. So this is how, let me July, July and August are messed up because of the baby, but essentially if you could see right here where it says the 22nd of July. It's my next big day of work.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:29:53 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah. That's the one where we're meeting at five. Yeah. So I start. So my office this time is in daily city. So I have 10. and offices around northern California that I drive to this one's in daily city about 30 minutes. So I'll probably leave in the uber. I have to get there 30 minutes before my start time so I have to get there at 7.45 so on this day I'm going to leave it 7.15 from my uber. And then you see I have appointments every 45 minutes 8.15, 9.9.45, 10.30, 11.15. I think I said go a few lunch here so 12, 12.30, 1.15 and then I finished it too roughly for that day. And then the next the following day I started 9 in San Leandro which is also about this one's about 45 minutes away. I at 9. have to get 30.30 so I leave at about 7.45 and uber and I have appointments every 45 minutes until 5 o'clock taking uber home takes an hour to get home from San Leandro at night time so I'll get home about 6 that day. You get the idea, sort of. Yeah, then on Wednesday, it's the same thing, but my office is in San Jose, which is about 30 minutes away. this one finishes at 2 PM, and then 25th, I don't have any work. The next week I work on Wednesday and Thursday, the following week in August, I work on the 6th and the 7th, following week after that on the 13th, following week after that, I work three days. So that's kind of my schedule. It's all over the place, but eight to 11 days a month, generally.
00:31:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how do you feel on those days?
00:31:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I love it. really good at it. I'm really good at this kind of work, and so I do enjoy going. It's like my time to do something I'm really good at. And I know what to do, right? It's easy now. It's easy. I'm good at it. I think that's why I like it, right? I know I could do it and it makes me a lot of money. Every appointment that you see is essentially $2,000 with profit for me. So it's easy to get myself out of bed to do, you know, five, six, sometimes 10 visits a day.
00:32:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is, I was, I was nervous about that, but I love that you love it. You know that there's not a lot of people that really love what they do. I love it. I love things. You said it.
00:32:39 - Michael Fujinaka
I like it a lot because I'm just good at it and it's easy now. know what's coming. It's fun to kind of like figure out how to make it work for these medical cases. And yeah, it pays me a lot of money. It's like it hits all the boxes. So I don't know if like I love it. I would. Choose to do this, but it's if I have to work. It's definitely work. I love or I like a lot You wouldn't choose that. No, I mean, I'd rather sit on the beach thing go surfing like I did on Wednesday You know, they're like boogie boarding on the beach. That's what I do. I'd spearfish for food, you know But but if I had to do something that made money or like I had to do some that work This is like the biggest bang for my calorie like It's just I got it.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay Good. It's all and it's not When you see like well, you generally won't see my face probably I try to do it from time to time to connect, you know and But but when you hear it and you hear me cuz because you'll be able to recognize what I'm like wait, what? I want to understand if there's a Conflicting kind of state payments or values like, all right, because if you say you love it, but you wouldn't choose to do it, then, but you, you in the realm of I've got to work, I've got to earn money. If I have to, then this really, and the fact that you said, so being really good at it, it being highly profitable. And then also, when you said you like to figure out how to make it work for people, so puzzles, you know, they kind of light up an intelligent mind and that it's kind of some gamification for you to be able to participate and engage in. And to me, that speaks to the longevity of it, being able to, as long as there is, because I don't know, especially because you enjoy the, I don't know, spearfishing is like relaxing, but that's also
00:35:00 - Michael Fujinaka
a game to like. Oh, I just do that out there. don't know. I would go surfing every day or jujitsu every day.
00:35:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
jujitsu too is a wrestle though. So that that um and jujitsu is like you're engaging every muscle in your body. So that's my love.
00:35:20 - Michael Fujinaka
That is my love. If I had to say something I would do every day at 12 which my colleagues do sometimes that is what I would do every day. jujitsu for an hour.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How often do you do it?
00:35:35 - Michael Fujinaka
Oh, once a week on Sunday afternoon. So they have a free it's called open mat. It's for people like me that don't pay membership. It's called open mat. So anyone that is busy can't go can go from 10 to 12 a.m. on Sundays. I missed it this week because everyone had COVID yesterday. But yeah, usually I could do that and then I've been trying to make an effort to go Fridays from noon to one. another open mat for people that are busy, but they have a class every day at 12 to 1 and I've been I've been thinking about like figuring out if I could make that work from my schedule to go like you know Monday through Thursday or something or even just Monday Wednesday Friday. But yeah, that'd be great. But all right, you know, you know, schedule is just so so varied when I have to do the Q and E days that it's just sometimes just I haven't wanted to get a membership because yeah, I don't know.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there only one dojo in your area?
00:36:36 - Michael Fujinaka
No, there's there's a couple.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is where principles and priorities values come into play and where sometimes we make decisions based on values that aren't actually the ones that we really have in that service best. but they're the ones that are most apparent. So not spending money you're not using. Whereas the other way to look at it would be investing in access, maximum level access. So if I was making a million dollars or whatever, like let's just say I'm making so much money that I never have to worry about it, everything's paid and my wealth is growing. Okay. True. And I'm not in a situation where I have zero time in order to do that. I have wiggle in everything. I do.
00:37:41 - Michael Fujinaka
Right?
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. And I know that joy is an energy maximizer and I know that physical fitness is a life, money, joy, and longevity maximizer. Agree. Okay. I'm going to give myself and use my resources to have as much access to pause. I'm going to be a member of every JoJo.
00:38:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I see. Yeah, I was wait. Yeah, I just can't. It's hard to like wrap my head around spending 180. The membership of this gym, I love the gym because I know all the people, but it's like, it's $180 a month. And it's, they don't have any packages. It's just like you either use it or you lose it. So like every time I can't go because they have evening classes too from six to eight, but I've said like, that's family time for me. So I'm like, oh, but if I can only go eight possible Monday through Fridays a month.
00:38:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would you pay $120 to go play for an hour at the place that you love the most?
00:38:47 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't know if I'd be $120 an hour.
00:38:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the place that you love the most to play on the best playground. Or do the thing that you love 100 you pay $90 per massage.
00:39:04 - Michael Fujinaka
I love massage. Yeah, I love you just do That could be $90. I got a package.
00:39:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:39:10 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I love to just do I also don't like paying it because in the classes, I don't like how they're run How do you do fighting for 12 like I just this like they spent half their time doing like cardio Which is like jumping jacks and I'm like, okay for 30 minutes I can do at home the last 15 minutes is they teach a move and then the last 15 minutes is what I love is the rolling Like, you know getting actually like wrestle with you. Yeah, so it's only like 15 minutes of that whole hour of these spend So that's another reason like I can't wrap my head around spending 100 whatever $180 for that 15 minutes of that kind of play.
00:39:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, would I pay for it for two hours? Yeah, an hour, yeah Well, so but here's the thing if you're going twice a week Yeah, that's 30 minutes. True times 4.5 in the month, right? So that's two and a half hours. You just said, if I got two hours, I'd pay $180.
00:40:07 - Michael Fujinaka
Well, okay, that's interesting.
00:40:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's less than a dollar a minute, by the way.
00:40:16 - Michael Fujinaka
You're right. My wife says it's, I told her this too, and she's like, just sign up. What are you waiting for? I'm like, oh, gosh, this is so frustrating. don't wrestle the entire class.
00:40:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to rush. But what if, what if you became an investor and instead of paying for a class, you say, I'll give you $1,000 a month, but I would like you to create this one class. And it's just rolling. It's just my favorite thing. And I'll come to it and they put your little card out there.
00:40:44 - Michael Fujinaka
Interesting.
00:40:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, this is the thing when you have resources and you look for levers everywhere. if one doesn't exist, you make one. That's one of the great gifts about money. Like, you, you're like, I want to make sure I can give my family and do all of these things. But it's also power and you can do good things with it. So now they're getting extra money from you. But what are the odds that you're the only one that wants that?
00:41:12 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, that's true.
00:41:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're just managing the way that they choose to. Maybe the way that they think is right. But maybe they don't know on a business level. They're missing out because other people feel the way you do.
00:41:24 - Michael Fujinaka
I love that. That's actually really creative. One of the coaches there is willing to stay a little longer because I'm drilled with them. There's two things I like is drilling, which is practicing the moves. my whole Jiu Jitsu game, I'm really good at probably maybe 10 things. Out of all the different thousands of moves, I'm good at 10 of them. And I drill them more than anyone else. I practice practice practice. And that's what I like. So my idea would be I'd do 30 minutes of that. maybe I work on an 11th move, for instance, and I just do that for 30 minutes, and in the last 30 minutes, we fight, or we wrestle. So yeah, that's a really good idea. Maybe I could propose that to the schools, like, hey, I will fund an extra 30 minutes at the end of class, that way I get 15 minutes in the class that is the wrestling, and then 30 minutes of my, you know, the drilling. And then I'll pay for that coach to stay there. You know, that's actually really creating there. I know they get paid 25 an hour.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's not, it's actually cheaper than the members. Yes, yes, but also think about this long term. You're very young. You know you're gonna continue to make more money. You're going to need to have investments to protect your money, or the government's just gonna take a huge chunk of it. What if you bought your own dojo, and you hired your own sentes, and you get to make the rules? there's so many different ways. maybe it's not the now thing, but if you loved Jujitsu that much, you could create programs. youth programs, other training programs, and again it doesn't have to be an altruistic thing, it could be just an investment in your network. The more people that you know and that know you and see you as just a community leader, whatever, the more business you get, and I don't know if what you do makes that relative or not, but there's all kinds of angles to always consider, but at the end of the how I'm going to get what I want. I'm going to use every resource available to get what I want, because when I'm happiest, the people that I take care of are best served. I think everybody's like that. All of us have gifts to give, and even if we take any kind of altruism out of it, we're just happier and better and more productive when we get the things that we want. Jujut. too is like tell me something that there's that's bad about it. There's nothing bad about it. There might be some risk of injury involved, but there's risk in life. You could choke on a fly breathing in like anything could happen, you know what I mean? So, but if that's, man, all right, we're gonna spend the rest of the time going over this, but actually this is useful though because I did get to your schedule and so this is important.
00:44:28 - Michael Fujinaka
was realize the times of my life when I there was a time of my life for about two years where I would go to that the 12 one o'clock class probably probably three times a week and I know that when I do jujitsu like on Sundays usually or some of the Fridays I mean I I'm just everything's better right my mood's better and I'm not as snappy I I yeah because you got that cortisol out yeah yeah I'm willing to. Yeah, I'm willing to work and You probably sleep better. Oh, yeah, I definitely sleep better. think so. I know I know more you did too Yeah, and it is crazy that I don't use the resources to to get access I've never thought about thinking of it like that But yeah, if I pay or use my resources for access Yeah, I just I hate I hate the value of it Even if I'm paying for it, want there to be good value in it But yeah, there might be creative ways I could work with that.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There is you just flipped the value You were looking at what you weren't getting instead of what you were getting and you weren't looking at How you multiply what you get so you just said that when you do it you're in better mood You're more energized you sleep better. All of those are already values that you stated. Those are currencies so If you're looking at the only currency exchange as I give money I get 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, right? Then that's an upside-down equation. Well, we all have to learn how to evaluate more powerfully. That's where the leverage is. So, but if the currency exchange is, you're giving $180 and 15 minutes of Jiu Jitsu, plus hours of happiness, plus an entire night's better sleep, plus all the activity that comes as a result of the better sleep, a better mood, AKA, happier Esther, happier Emmy, happier new baby.
00:46:43 - Michael Fujinaka
That currency is, your ROI is pretty solid there, Fuji. Okay, for 180 bucks, yeah.
00:46:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:51 - Michael Fujinaka
I actually went through the trouble of asking the coach if I could buy a package, you know, like a package deal where I put, you know, $100 and I get a package. you know five lessons or something and they were like now we don't we don't have that it's 180 dollars or nothing so I I did try little things to weasel but yeah I think if I shifted what I'm getting the ROI like as an investment oh this is great thanks Tia this is great welcome I'm here I'm here to help um and I this is why I end up keeping people for years and I like to do it because I'm going to look for ways to be helpful to you and if I feel like I'm slowing down and not being so helpful I'm gonna go be like okay what does Fujini now go work on it I feel really I feel really good like hopeful right now I think yeah I am gonna make an effort to to get back into this because it is something I whenever I talk to people it's something that I love is jujitsu and wrestling and yeah girls too to put them in there oh yeah yeah that's yeah Emmy I've I've been taking every Monday Wednesday ice. I actually shifted, if you notice my schedule, I actually shifted my Monday and Wednesdays. The reason I finished at two is because I can come home, takes an hour to get home. At three o'clock I pick up Emmy and then I get her to Jiu Jitsu by 3.30, class starts at four. So I'm making an effort to essentially coach Monday and Wednesday toddler class Jiu Jitsu for.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, I love that.
00:48:27 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I don't get to do it, right? I'm just there moving the little three-year-olds around. But yeah, as long as I'm able to do that with my schedule, actually, we revamped my whole schedule to make it so that Monday and Wednesdays I'm pretty much free every week from three to four.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and this comes back to the family values and container, because you just said as long as I'm able to. With your situation and the leveraged activities that you have, there's no reason you shouldn't ever be able to if you. prioritize that. You have the ability to keep everything in proper containers so that you're maximizing your revenue without spilling into the family value container. And that's why we need to set them. So when you give me that, that time with Emmy and Jiu Jitsu needs to be there. I need you to think about everything that is important in your schedule that you have probably just done not unconsciously but without making a conscious correlation to a value. Like this is what I do, not this is what I do because this is critical and important to me and I want to make sure to protect this. Because I think that there are things that you do that with but you just haven't consciously said. and stated this is the value and the reason why I'm doing this and and that okay so it's 11 days let's see and that was QME July medical so what is the thing that you do with Mark?
00:50:21 - Michael Fujinaka
That's July medical it was what I started with mark was a different business that I had a really poor business relationship and I exited that in 2022 so July medical is something I started in 2023 and it's the same business that I used to do except now it's 100% telehealth. Okay I see so when Mark's clients get into car collisions usually their doctors you know about this but you know their insurance their own doctors won't see them because car collisions are like another litigation. There's legal, so their doctors don't see them so my clinic or clinics like mine will step into seed patients on a contingency or lean and that means I don't get paid for a year two to three years but I see them for free on a contingency and now my clinic july is 100% virtual and so that's what I work with mark on.
00:51:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay um do you only do that with mark like is he your only person that you do that with?
00:51:31 - Michael Fujinaka
No I probably have about six to ten law firms that utilize my clinic and each of those law firms will send me roughly I don't know 10 to 20 clients a month and my expected return on each of those clients is about three to four hundred dollars each client but I but I have to wait right the payout is right right never or two to three years in advance so yeah mark was saying his average settlement is like 18 months yep
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but you don't get any other clients other than what attorneys send you in that business, is that correct? I don't allow it.
00:52:10 - Michael Fujinaka
I don't let people come to my clinic unless they're represented by an attorney because they just, they're going to fail. Like if you fight against the insurance company without an attorney, most people fail and I get zero.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And that's one full day per week.
00:52:33 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, I mean, I think I have to spend about eight hours, maybe doing it. And that's the stuff that we talked about earlier in this called the bookkeeping, you know, making, watching over my staff checking notes. Every single note that comes through. So we're doing about like 15 visits a day. I look through every one of those notes every day to make sure my nurses that work for me are writing good notes. So I think all in all, it probably is about eight hours a week, roughly.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But not all in one day, just kind of spread out, or how does that work?
00:53:09 - Michael Fujinaka
Yeah, every night, I take about 30 minutes to go through all the nurses' notes. you use just about 10 to 15 notes. And so I read through them all, make sure they're accurate, and then I approve them to be sent to the lawyers. So that takes about maybe 30 minutes. then the other, maybe I'll take like a block because I really don't like to do it. So every Friday or Saturday, I'll do it. I take about an hour, two hours to look through my books. I look through, I make sure that the staff is getting paid, kind of more like the administrative stuff. I will answer any hateful, even I hateful, but like emails that people are, like patients are unhappy about what something we wrote. So I kind of leave all that to the end of the week, and then I do it in a block of time. It's about two hours, an hour, two hours.
00:54:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you ever resist that task or does it bother you or you just do it?
00:54:10 - Michael Fujinaka
The 30 minutes every evening, I do it because it's, I mean, I know how much I'm going to make. Each visits 300 bucks and 10 visits, that's about $3,000 to $5,000, So I don't mind doing that at all. thing I resist is probably going through the problems, the problem emails that I have. And I have a manager that actually screens it. So that's been helping a lot the last couple of months. It's just things that need my attention, just very weird things that come up. one of them needed, couldn't do an MRI because they had a gunshot to their shoulder. So I needed to change the note to make it a CT, a CAT scan or an x-ray instead of a magnetic, you know, MRI. it's like little things like that that come up that my manager can't fix.
00:54:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That I have to take care of every week. So, um, one thing to potentially consider is maybe that's an activity that you can move in or schedule to be something that you do right before Jiu Jitsu or something physical where you can go release that stress very quickly, or somehow consider the energy sandwich and but create a physical release for after that. So, obviously, not late at night, also that's probably not conducive to your sleep.
00:55:33 - Michael Fujinaka
That's a good point.
00:55:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I usually do it in the evening. Yeah. um, I don't allow stressful conversations whenever possible. Sometimes things have to be had past like dinner time. We'll discuss it tomorrow. Oh, interesting. will discuss it tomorrow because because number one, the open moves in my brain. So, likelihood that we're going to solve that tonight. Yeah. With the amount of time left in the day with the fact that everybody's winding down, whatever, probably not very good, but it is going to live in my brain. And I'm going to try to solve it where I can't actually be working on it because it requires somebody else to participate in a conversation in a process whatever, right, because they're the one that brought the problem. So, but if I say we will discuss it tomorrow, I didn't ask any questions, I didn't engage in it, so I'm able to compartmentalize most things. Some things are, all right, we're dealing with this now. This needs to be resolved right now. You'll know what those types of things are.
00:56:35 - Michael Fujinaka
They're not very common, but some of those things come up.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Especially as daughters, you're going to get those. But whenever possible, I would just say that problem will wait until tomorrow when I'm in that kind of zone. So, in the morning, I don't want to engage with anybody. don't do client work. I don't answer emails. I don't respond to anything that could be, um, conflicting or contentious and they're not the same conflicting could just be I don't even know I have to make a decision and I have to evaluate things so it's complex I'll say complex nothing complex in the morning because now I'm in problem solving mode. But in the morning I want to be in creative mode. So, because I want to use my best mathematical skills for creation and building and leveraging rather than problem solving because solving a problem honestly I could do that stuff in my sleep. But being creative is not a space that I'm in all the time. My brain is good enough I can solve most problems most of the time. Creating is different. building my business, creating new solutions, creating new organizations, hiring things like that so so my morning time is for. reading, meditating, just being slow and quiet sometimes just hair and makeup is a therapy thing for me. I'm just quiet. I'm not listening to anything. I'm just pondering and thinking while I'm doing it. And this has been really helpful for Mark too. He's doing meditative stuff now, but he used to talk Dolce. But in the morning, what he used to do is reach for his mom and immediately stress cortisol problem solving. His creativity, his problem solving in a creative way has massively changed since his morning routine has changed. Speaking of which, have to go meet with him in one minute. So we'll go through more of this schedule. But the goal is every week that you've got something that you feel like you can work on. something that you're pondering, something you're enacting, so we've got the gist of it. will send you a follow-up email within the next few hours. I'll say by end of day today, just because Mondays are kind of crazy and I gotta make sure where's my phone, set my alarm, set an alarm for 3 p.m. Call it get-go-g notes. And now you're official. Yeah, so good job. You'll be getting an invoice too for being 8 if you do it again. We'll give you, I don't want to give you a free pass. I'm gonna give you a free pass, but don't do this again. Get your homework done because, you know, massage or like, just imagine you won't pay $180 for just when you like it. You're definitely gonna hate that whole $90 for not getting your homework done. So I'm gonna give you one pass, one. All right. good talking to um you know if you guys do end up having the baby if everything i would love to hear about it we'll do be healthy be well and we'll talk to you soon

That's weird, it's like grey, hi, hello, how are you, good and well, yeah, deep breath.
00:00:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, today is, this is our, my work week, so it's every day, every day, lots of meetings for me today, but I just came from a saw, so I'm trying to wake back up because she put me out.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
awesome. Yes, my lady, she's a Russian and she's been taking care of me for years and I just go like, like, I get baby like little girl taking care of and I'm like, oh, it's the best so. And then I was like, Booty paid for this today. Hey, glad to, glad to accountability. I like felt bad about it for a minute. I'm like, well, you use the one that wants accountability and you needed this. So we just get you to do your stuff without punishment. Then I'll pay for my own. Just happily. And you will have learned the thing.
00:01:22 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't feel bad at all. I didn't get it.
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what are you ready to work on this today?
00:01:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
looks like you are. Yeah, so this is from July. I'm like, you know, like we talked about two weeks ago, we hired the manager. been really good. I've been giving him, you know, little by little bit, giving him some of the tasks that I do, of which, you know, tracking the numbers is one of them. So we expanded this based on what we talked about, I think, two weeks ago. then last week we completed it. And so these are pretty much all of our data as far as we can go back and track. So we opened in April of 2023 and you can see we got 87 people that first month, we didn't really keep track of it then so we just started it the next month but essentially after that we started tracking how many new visits we completed and these are the follow-ups and you can kind of actually see that we were actually doing okay in some of the months like you know some of the ones last month we got 94 so this month we're we're act you know like we talked about we're actively trying to seek out second visits and third visits from from case managers. Awesome.
00:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to process the data but also I have some immediate thoughts. A couple of things are number one I would like to put a formula after column B which is basically the current month divided by the previous month. or, you know, and going up and down so that we're looking at a percentage of change, increase or decrease month to month, just kind of eyeballing the fluctuation on a percentage level. The raw numbers are helpful, but just that other perspective just kind of helps take a look at things. And it also is a faster way of triggering an appropriate level of alarm or yay, you know, celebration when you see those percentages. So we can do that pretty easily. And then I know that we don't know what you get paid per visit. I know that that's a unique thing. But what I would like to do is, and we were starting to calculate just kind of average fee per visit. I know how not accurate that number is. I am aware of that. But it gives us something to look at that does have a real corollary value, you know, to kind of look at how things are going. So as long as we keep that in perspective and don't, you know, and I know you won't, but just, you know, I'm not going to go. That's a real number. That would be something that would be good for us to do as well. Sorry about that. Let's see. It's all of us. It's okay. we're tracking Washington, Arizona, Mexico, familiar state to me. I'm meeting with Jonah and Margaret too. this is, this is my sweet love, oogee day. Good people. I like good people. All of us is completed. I love that that number went up. up even though number of referrals went down. So, let's see, actually, never mind. Okay, so total NP is completed. That's what I actually want to look at. And how many of those were referrals? NPV. What does NPV stand for? It's the first one.
00:05:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's initial new patient visits.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a new patient visits. Okay. I was like, I know, think that that's initial, but I don't know of course. I think she massaged my brain just late. Okay, so that didn't go down that went up. That's awesome. That number had a couple of dips out of curiosity. Do you happen to have any idea what happened in November and December that your numbers went down? could you pinpoint that to anything? Or is that just? July is referrals and so this isn't like Q and me is the one that has a lot of you, right? Yeah, this is July. Okay. Um any idea what that dip was about?
00:06:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, you know, this is actually up in so up in these first six months I did all the marketing myself, meaning I'm calling, you know, was calling case managers like Mark's team and I was just begging them to send me a client and in October I actually stopped and I I bought three different marketing companies. So I put each of them charged me $1500 a month to market for me and I I said, Hey, let's try it. So I I tried three different companies. Only one of them actually did anything and I cut the other two off. But that's what happened in October and November is I stopped doing it myself. And I think you could see like by January like the three marketing companies, they started getting a little traction help me out a little bit. But the first few months that I stopped doing anything on my own, this is what happened.
00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So are you still doing it?
00:07:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, I'm just using one marketing company and yeah.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:07:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And again, like this, you know, this value for a number of referrals is where I always wanted to be was about 400 a month. I thought just 400 referrals a month was good. know, 400 total visits would also be about right. So, you know, if we can get this every month combined with this number of total visits. That's actually kind of where I want to sit.
00:07:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's highlight those.
00:07:39 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah. But you know, the other thing that Mark was saying is that, you know, we're worried about the insurance is tracking me and trying to become too big. But I, you know, I hadn't really talked to Mark about what, hey, what if I go after just other states, right? know, and obviously they're tracking me in California, but what if I really try to. higher or do the marketing myself in Arizona and in Mexico, Washington, and really try to grow the volume there. But I haven't really explored that.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, can we make that a task? I didn't mean you make it a point of talking to him before we meet next week.
00:08:15 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, that'd be fun. Because it's really tough to end.
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And the sooner we know, the better. I heard that you guys might be having the most epic 24 hours ever.
00:08:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I just bought a car like I told you. And then last next week, we're buying a $4 million house. yeah, yeah, I will not be participating this year unless it becomes a little bit.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he had quoted like 50,000 a person.
00:08:48 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, it's like, I don't know about that one.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you just had a brownie baby. And that's a little bit on the dangerous side. If I was us or I'd be like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, But that's just probably way cooler than me.
00:09:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, she's actually letting me go to my friends for you for a big, it's next month.
00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, it's different than like drifting, okay? And just like, oh, that's crazy. I saw that like my heart.
00:09:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looked really cool to do.
00:09:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Father updates on July front to help us meet this volume I actually brought on a fifth provider. It's a physician assistant network like all the four physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are working for me, all like they like working for me. So they're all like, hey, can my friend get a job with you? So I finally picked one that looked good. And so we brought her on. She's actually starting right now. She took a shift from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. So she's seeing patients like right as we speak, this is her first day. So yeah, excited to do that. It'll increase our nighttime. And she's going to help in the evenings. weekends, particularly.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that'll help our capacity at those times to accommodate this volume. And what do you pay for that?
00:10:08 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I pay $75 a visit, whether it's a new or whether it's a return. And I increase their salary or I increase their pay to $30 after like six weeks.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's still a good margin for you and let you increase capacity without burning out?
00:10:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah, on average, we make about what 300 per visit blended between using returns, right? So I'm paying them $30 and then my staffing costs about probably about $30 on the back end for each visit, so.
00:10:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so yeah, that's good. And they're per visit, not per hour.
00:10:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah, totally per visit. I also pay them to if some patients want like a doctor's out to be excused off work. So I pee smell everything. charge, we charge for that. I charge for that to the lawyers. And then I subsequently pay them $12 if they write a work note for someone. And what do you charge for it? I charge $300 and I generally get paid about 50 on that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But $300 for the doctor's note?
00:11:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
For the doctor's.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. But you only get 50 out of it because of the way that, okay, got it, got it.
00:11:28 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I mean, I've been about 25%. So yeah, so maybe 60.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. So another formula that I want to have is the percentage of our PVs to NPVs. So that we're looking at.
00:11:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You know, I feel like we, I was supposed to do this. Do you think you could find the notes from last week? I was just looking real quick. I think we actually talked about. doing these things I just never did them.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and I didn't send a follow-up to actually make it an official task, but we did for sure.
00:12:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, I wasn't so familiar. So I'll work on those and get them done.
00:12:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and I mean, ultimately, and the faster we do this, the better your results are, right? And my goal is to make sure that you see the value in showing up and doing this work every week. This could be as possible because I want you to keep coming back. was like working with the same people. It's really nice for me. We do, we do. go. And the notes, that tasks.
00:12:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So I wanted to show you this one. This is something that you had kind of brought up about how we can track our workers remotely. so I want to the metrics that the manager and I came up with, it was just we look at their call logs like literally how many patients did you call a day right because if we know how many new visits or how many new referrals we got you know so if we got 300 in August that means there should have been there's 20 working days or there's 22 working days so there should have been like what 10, 15 calls a day and so and then obviously if you don't get someone the first day we call them at the second day so like if you can't look at any two days generally about right like they're calling you know most work days they're calling about not so many they're calling 20, 30 people a day something like that now Ollie Ollie actually works part-time she only works four hours and Eric and Carolina were eight hours so it is actually kind of interesting like most of the times it's almost double but there's some days where you see like she does almost as many as my full-timers so it's something the manager and I are going to look at, and this is the blended average so far that we created here.
00:14:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I would do additionally is actually put in the hours just so you again, there's something that is really powerful, and this is why we use the visuals, and also why we do specific types of formula and put data in a particular kind of way. Because what we want to do is make our brains be able to rapid-fire, get to the most powerful conclusion. So if you were to do that, put hours for each one of them, and then create a formula that were average calls per hour. Okay, we did that. Yeah, so oh there it is. I'm just focused. have tons of I thought it was. and I thought it would be the other way around. Wait, okay. So, when you say Eric slash Carol, how do I say that?
00:15:06 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, he has wife split a full shift. So he does the morning and she knows you does four hours in the afternoon.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, is that column H hours or calls?
00:15:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
This is this column is how many total on average they did for day.
00:15:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so where are you getting the formula for calls for hours? where are you getting hours in your formula?
00:15:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Or did you just plug it in? Oh, we first we looked at just the total number of months or total number of calls they made in a month right here. And then we divided it by how many hours they work, hundreds in general.
00:15:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was wondering where the hours came into the equation. Okay, so, because I thought you said that I like got more calls done.
00:16:05 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah, this is actually wrong. Yeah. She only worked 80. Yeah. that is right. Yeah. that's right. Yeah. That was wrong.
00:16:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ally is actually working like double speed. Yeah. that is significant. And let's, I mean, if we were gonna have to do even math. mean, that's roughly like 50% more.
00:16:30 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know how to use percentages.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you do? in this case, you would divide 1.52 by 2.46 times about 100. No, just divide. You'll get the same thing.
00:16:50 - Fujinaka, M.D.
We just move the decimal point. That's all. Yeah, she's doing 61% more. I don't know it.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that doesn't make sense.
00:16:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
She's. Yes, she's doing 61% more. Yeah.
00:17:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, because if she was doing 200 percent, we'll see.
00:17:10 - Fujinaka, M.D.
she's doing 100 more than that would be 3.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. Yeah. So she's doing 60% more.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then two people. So either one of them is very slow or both of them are slow. Or maybe she's just super fast and we do have we do get lucky sometimes and get because like Mark Scott, this girl Samantha and she kills everybody. She smokes everybody. She is a massively driven. You can't just go get us a man but you can't. So that might be what but it's worth looking into. It's worth considering. Do we share team numbers? Do we drive internal competition and incentive by saying here's the targets and here's the and maybe we don't want to because like the other issue Mark has is way too much incentive in his program and he's paying too much in payroll for it so we have to do the math before you offer any kind of incentive program but for sure at the very least this is something we need to be contemplating and not just look at and take it and go like okay that's dinner and not do anything we're there to be such a big disparity either you've got a rock star or you've got slackers and if it's a slacker situation then that's something that can potentially be trained potentially be incentivized or potentially you replace them but either way it's something to be thinking about
00:19:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, you want to look at China?
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see her say hi. Oh, my gosh.
00:19:07 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. Hello. Yeah, we were just going to go take a nap and say we're going to say hi to daddy and then go take a nap.
00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh. I missed the little one so bad.
00:19:19 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, so beautiful and perfect.
00:19:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's just a perfect blend of the two of you.
00:19:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Hi. It's hard to tell her right now. I know they're so young. Yeah. Just trying to get to sleep in her own crib so she's not like contact napping all the time. Oh, just like you can't give anything done during the day.
00:19:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember that battle and I wish I had leaned into it way more than I did because that goes so fast.
00:19:53 - Fujinaka, M.D.
You cannot believe how fast it goes.
00:19:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so I shouldn't try to train her out of it too quickly. So here's the thing. you sleep very well with that Puji?
00:20:02 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I sleep better without him.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We both agree that we sleep better like separately. Everybody is different but it's been interesting you know because I've got two that are all the way grown. I've got two grandkids and two that are mostly grown plus sisters and siblings and just working with people along that. There's this huge, I don't know, we all listen to different things and feel different things but trying to get kids to sleep alone and and parents get frustrated that they won't do it and those people, most of them don't want to sleep alone can't sleep alone and it's funny that they want really tiny children just to be able to be alone and be comfortable when it's not the natural thing. are cultures that are never away from their children. They pack them onto their backs. They don't mean you see that a lot and co-sleeping is just a lot more common and other cultures around the world. Yeah, so but you know when you're a driven mama and you have an active brain and you want to use your brain That's an important thing to and taking care of you is an important thing, and so it's difficult But the one thing I would say is whatever your heart calls you to do Lean into your heart more than your brain Your brain will get outlets later, but if you hurt your heart that damage can be So long-lasting and that's where the regrets come from not helping your brain I promise you Okay, that's good advice.
00:21:38 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I want to take out more of your precious hour with Tina, so Thank you wanted to show you something else that I am working on You want to So, okay, so this is where I really Can you coach to step in over the board? Yes, but yeah, I'll just show you what I am done.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes, the Bing.
00:22:14 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Bing background. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I have an online clinic and I have a company. We haven't like we just sort of started, but we market this thing. You get a brain MRI.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you see my screen? I can and you told me a little bit about that.
00:22:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So, yeah, so anyway, I just, just kind of, we're just starting. this. And again, the payment structures are fluctuated, but essentially my cost for this brain scan is $1,000 of my cost, and I'm reselling it for $2,500. So each sale makes me roughly $1,500. And yeah, anyway, so that's that. I am just starting it with the founder of this technology. So anyway, I spent all yesterday night making this payment platform and this website and getting the bank account set up. So finally, everything's ready to go. have the business registered, I have the bank now, I have the website. last piece I need to do is just structure the clinic side a little bit better because I'm serving all 50 states.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and where do your customers come from?
00:23:56 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Right now, they come from the company itself. So this company BrainKey out of Germany, people email them from the United States and it's like, I want to get your brain scan and since they don't have a US presence, they are sending them to me.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And they say, hey, you have the machine that can do it, basically?
00:24:18 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, we have contracts with the imaging centers. A lot of the same ones Mark uses for his PI cases, actually. I just go to them and get a contract with me. Okay. So that's why it's the $1000. So the $1000 is about 800 of it goes to the MRI center where I send them and then about 200 I send it to BrainKey to analyze the results.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the value is in BrainKey's evaluation and reporting or, okay, you give me a little bit more about the USP, which is the unique selling point of why, why then?
00:25:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, they're the only brain analysis software on the market that can do these volumetric measurements. So if you look on this little screen, they're sectioning out the brain based on what structure it is, and they actually measure how big it is. So we could track over time pretty clearly, like if you're developing Alzheimer's, you're going to see this really specific area of your brain, unfortunately, strength, They show that that part of your brain, the amygdala for alcohol actually shrinks, shrinks, shrinks. And we could see it get bigger when you get better sleep, when you stop drinking alcohol, et cetera.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And who's your target market for this?
00:25:46 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Do you have an avatar or multiple avatars? Yes. it's usually it's Asian males that make over 150,000 a year, they're single or not single. But it's Asian males over 100, making over 150,000 a year that would be. between the ages of 40 and 50 and, like, 58 to 65-ish.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much of that demographic is within your realm physically?
00:26:16 - Fujinaka, M.D.
A lot, because most of them tend to live around the major city centers, where I have the contracts with the centers.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why Asian specifically?
00:26:25 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I don't know. I think, I don't know. not sure why it's Asian. I mean, obviously, I think the majority is like, they're like, it's 50-50 Asian white male. I'm not sure why. I personally think it's like the midlife crises that these people are dealing with in general. Like, why it's a lot of males and not as many females.
00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could give you lots of reasons why it's probably more males and higher earning males, just because what got them to the higher earning was very stressful on their bodies. They overworked.
00:27:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
probably during too much did all the network too much.
00:27:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They did a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do and have gotten to the point where, especially now in this world, we're very aware of the clock ticking but as well the opportunity and the medical technology that can buy us another decade or two. Whereas women, not as competitive, do a lot of things that are better for their hearts, they talk to each other, they've got a network, they're more aware of health in general and probably haven't neglected it to the extent and are also less likely to go and pay and spend this amount of money on themselves for their health or rather they'd go get, you know, breast and butt lifts so they look good for the man because that's not really for them, that's for somebody else kind of thing but the psychology behind it makes perfect sense to me to say it's part does not necessarily make sense to me and it's not really necessary because You don't have to, in the marketing, target anything that would be Asian specific, but the reason I ask about the avatars is because you do want the marketing to speak to them wherever they're at, whatever their values are, and for sure there's a, there's a huge difference, I think, between Asians period because of the collectivist culture with just the standard American, which is the individualistic culture, the values, the reasons, the logic for doing things is different. And so, like if you were going to, and I don't really know how much that applies to Asians living in America as much, but anyway, just the language, right? So are you doing this for yourself versus doing this for your family? And you would probably want to split test some of the messages. We would probably want to have a few different landing pages and keywords research campaigns. based off of what's happening. What I would be interested to know is what they know about marketing that works in other areas and what they would be willing to share with you.
00:29:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, and the only one that does this here. Yeah, so that's what's interesting about this opportunity to me is because brain key right now is only sold through brick and mortar concierge clinics. So the only way they're getting customers is they go to a concierge doctor and says, hey, give this to your clients and those are their salesmen. I'm like the first mass market clinic for them. But yeah, but because of that, you don't really have a good sense of like who they're, you know, who's buying it or why they're buying it because all there's, they see the data, right? They see how old the person is male or female, just from the scan data, but they're not actually talking to their clients, which is really interesting. It's like, yeah.
00:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have any idea what percentage of doctors are Asian in your area or in any of the metro areas? Just wondering because culturalistically, more, let's say any other nationality to Asians, you're going have Asians and like Filipinos, which is a mix between Mexican and Asian, right? There's a huge drive to be doctors. So, I was wondering if the correlation just happens to be that there are more Asian doctors and they're pitching it to Asians because they're like, hey, I think you might like this more than some of these other people that don't, I don't know, like I'm trying to figure out what could that possibly, or could they have got that demographic from? anyway, my brain, I'm always trying to analyze because if you understand the demographic and the true data, then it makes marketing that much easier.
00:31:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
So yeah, I just, yeah, the company, even like the owner, I, and I'm friends with the founder, he's just like, sorry, man, I like, I literally don't know because we don't sell this. It's only the upstairs doctors that sell it to their own clients. And yeah, like, I was like, well, do you have numbers? And he's like, well, not really.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your, when you first thought about this, and up until now, what was your plan of attack for marketing?
00:31:31 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Well, I actually talked to Mark a lot about this, and it was really just to run Google ads. our thought was as long as I could make, you know, as long as I can make $100 more than my ad spend, it's very straightforward business, right? Yeah, I'm just, essentially, just reselling this product. I'm like selling online.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has, has Mark ever mentioned Dan to you?
00:31:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is a client that referred Mark to me that we do work together and Dan's very good at Google Ads and also Google Analytics. So especially because this is a new market, we're going to need to make sure that you've got analytics and that we're watching it closely. We're going to want to have a heat map on here. Do you know what a heat map is?
00:32:26 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Kind of like where they're looking and clicking.
00:32:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And we're also going to want to watch the behavior to find out what they're coming from. I think that some YouTube ads would probably be the most leverageable thing and the great thing of course is that combination between YouTube and Google is that you've got all of this data and they do, they're just really good at targeting by the algorithms, know, who might be interested in that. So if they're doing something that's relative like looking up a particular issue whose solution is you need an MRI. Guess who's at they're probably going to start up. Who's running ads for MRIs? Like nobody probably. I don't know. Anyway so creating some YouTube ads would probably be a good idea and a lot of that could probably be done with AI videos now. You know of course we could actually hire some people but most of it could be some either stock videos or a few like videos of the machine of the reports things like that with a voiceover which also could be AI. It could be a voice actor which we could pay very inexpensively off of Upwork something like that. You have a good voice. I think that's so weird but you're not anywhere near the first person to say that. I hated my voice until I was like mid 30s and Now I won't do video because I feel so gross and ugly. mean, I spent all Saturday. I spent my time doing videos for marketing. Can't do it. Anyway, this is life. We've all got our weird things.
00:34:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Anyway. But I was so excited, you know, I feel your excitement in this. And I think the same thing as your keen in on is what makes me excited is because it's really something that if I can get the marketing right, this can make a good, good, like another stream of income for my family, you know, if I could just make, you know, 10 sales a month, , that's, that's an extra, you know, 120,000 a year.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm really happy with that. You then have a massively targeted list of potential other things that you could offer them. So now you're not going to know what their test results or whatever.
00:34:54 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What is that? No, is one of the things that, yeah, I wanted to sell because the one of the. The big things, if people take a test step six months and nine months, if they sleep better, you can easily see their skin improves.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was one of the things I was going to key in on, was like, um, what are we talking about when we first started talking and talked about naps and Steve and all that stuff.
00:35:17 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:35:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, having like a list of people willing to, willing to pay money to improve their brain. mean, yeah, I think well, a significant amount of money and also there's, there's more to it than that. So you might have people who are willing to pay money and invest in their health, but this avatar is scientifically minded. This avatar is not just about health improvement, but this guaranteed is going to be about life quality and longevity. And that's a whole new level up here. Okay, right? That's not the person who's like maybe trying to cut sugar. out of their diet or be on a diet or whatever. This is the person that is like this is serious, this is important and so I don't know how much you studied marketing but if you were to study direct response there's a guy named Eugene Schwartz and he what's it called breakthrough advertising. You would do really well to study it that book is dense it's owned by one of my clients actually so Jean is referenced so many times. He talks about levels of awareness so you've got the I know nothing about whatever you're selling market all the way up to I know everything I'm just looking for the thing to buy. There's like seven levels of awareness and if you get to the point where somebody has bought this their level of awareness of brain health of what is needed. How do you avoid amyloid plaque and not get Alzheimer's? How do you, like, could you as an affiliate offer have some sort of brain training program and software that you create by yourself that helps prevent Alzheimer's? Like, there's so many different things, and if we're looking at you being in this business and having the compounding effect of additional revenue streams where you're, it's scalable and you're not doing it for your time. This has long tentacles out into the future that, and you can build it, and then somebody would probably go buy it from you for, like, $20, $30 million if you were smart about it because you're disrupting right now, nobody's doing this.
00:37:45 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's fair. Alzheimer's is a great thing. This is actually one of the first campaigns that I wanted to run was actually run a campaign for Alzheimer's.
00:37:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what if you, so have you heard that ultrasound waves are now able to... to break up amyloid plaque and that is the first thing that they've ever found that can reverse Alzheimer's. Yeah, there's been no way to get rid of amyloid plaque until now ultrasound, which makes sense that that could do that, but that it could safely do it.
00:38:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Interesting.
00:38:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm also a medical nerd. study a lot. Health and longevity is a huge thing to me, so I like working with you.
00:38:34 - Fujinaka, M.D.
It's good.
00:38:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't tell I'm excited in my brain lights up about this, but anyway, if you found a service like that that you could also offer as concierge or make referrals or something like that, you already have the market. Oh, your scan came back with. And so because of HIPAA, you're not going to know anything, but what you can do is say, hey, you know, if you get results like this, here's what you can do. If you get results like this, here's what you can do. Now, HIPAA doesn't allow you to like ask questions per se or whatever or know the information, but they can self-select and I'm interested in this. So you have cause and effect. They select this, therefore, you know, probably assume the correlation and now you start marketing to them this type of thing. And then we get into email hygiene and how much better that makes your inbox, placement and all kinds of other things because you're super segmented and.
00:39:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And I guess that's why like I and that's the tough thing right now and I wanted to kind of get into too about like, you know, my time balance because, you know, we have we have something good going in July. And, you know, that's why like, you know, much how much my time should I be putting in July to kind of really pump, you know, pump my July business. We have the Q and is, you know, that we're making some changes to be more efficient on, you know, I guess, is this now a, you know, is this a good thing to really go after the delta, you know, I call it delta.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll tell you my overall strategy for everybody. And first of all, business 101, the verification. Your best bet at success is multiple types of things going on. So the first thought that I just had when you went back to July medical is, you know what, that's probably the way to build the funds to, you know, make sure that you've got everything that you need over here to invest in some marketing, to invest in some good advertising. Because if you're not, if you're going to do this, do it, do it right. Yeah.
00:40:49 - Fujinaka, M.D.
And it's not a, you mean delta?
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Yeah. But the other thing was I was like, well, maybe that just takes off the bumpers off of July medical, and you grow as big as you want to. And then somebody gets attention. and then and pulls you down. You're like, okay, bye done. But the insurance take care of its job of the liabilities and whatever happened to you and be like, okay, pull the plug on that. Moving on, thank you for the signal universe.
00:41:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Goodbye. Yeah. Yeah, and it's kind of just and you said that too, because we're, you know, I'm looking at the total amount of AR that we have and we just passed $5 million in AR, which is about one point, you know, if we get a 25% return, that's close to that's close to 1.5 million. So I think if we keep even just at this level, we're accumulating AR at about about three million, four million a year, just at this current level. So yeah, it's a good point that, you know, even in five years, if I get pulled down by insurance, I'm going to have accumulated, you know, close to 30 million in AR probably by then.
00:41:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not only that, you now have some assets, you have doctor referrals, you could pretend actually sell something, have some sort of asset that is sellable, so maybe it's not the entity, but maybe it's the contacts, maybe it's the business relationship, and if you go and tell all these people that are referring to you and you go really vet the person, so somebody buys your business from you, which isn't really a business anymore, right? Because they have to do their own name, whatever. But what they're buying is the insertion into your network, and this person will be so vetted by you that you go make a personal recommendation to all of these people, hey, this person's gonna take care of you, I'm trying them on this, this, this, this, and this, but you actually don't really even need the reputation anymore out of integrity, you would do a good job, but let's say they didn't, let's say you vetted them wrong, if that bridge is burned, you've got all these other things going on anyway. That's a good question.
00:42:55 - Fujinaka, M.D.
What?
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good point. Yeah. Yeah. and that's the thing that You want, it's not invincibility, but it's, you want to be shielded from whatever can go wrong or if you're making the risk, it's a educated and it's an educated risk where you're, you've got everything coming. So you've got Delta when you've got QME and, well, no, I know, but I'm at July goes.
00:43:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, yeah.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah. So, and I'm sure that other things are going to present themselves, um, as you, as you, as you go.
00:43:42 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I like that.
00:43:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, especially with whatever related to, like, if you get into the ultrasound stuff for, for Alzheimer's, first of all, that information needs to be so much more widely spread because it's such a big deal, like we lose people. Um, New, but the knowledge and the science behind it for the most part isn't new. It's just we found the missing piece and nobody knows about it yet. And it needs traction. And the other thing that we know is that government, health care, pharmaceuticals, whatever, we're going to do their best to keep that down because drugs are big money, sick people are big money. So you've got these two different competing markets. You have a great way to to to to I don't serve and leverage in there.
00:45:35 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, we actually hope that this, you know, this price point, we can actually lower it in the coming years. We think that the MRI bills will be lower next year, you know, just because every year the price seems to come down a little. So hopefully this, you know, we'll start to be able to offer this at like $2,000, for instance, every year. So like you're saying, hopefully this diagnostic piece will get cheaper every year. And then, you know, you pair that with the technology like treatment, like all just sound, that'd be really cool.
00:46:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And can they use like a health savings account for this?
00:46:09 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I have to apply through government, but yes, you have to get a tag.
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the two things I would try to do would be to get that as quickly as possible. Because you want to remove friction from anybody who wants it as much as possible. So they can use, especially because entrepreneurial type people, if they don't have the insurance, we'll have HSA's because this probably wouldn't cover it in most insurance anyway, depending on what kind of diagnosis they had to begin with. And then the other thing is a payment plan. So there are lots of different services that you could sign up for that would give you a payment plan. And those two things right there are going to help remove some friction points right away. And then the other thing about a higher price point is that it allows you to offer like referral discounts. So refer a friend and you know, they say $500 or you say $500 on your next one or that type of thing. And you still preserve solid margins, but you know, that's the whole thing about marketing. They have the feeling that they've saved money. And the fact that they can't go get it anywhere else serves you a very good purpose right there.
00:47:21 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay. I like that. Yeah, I just asked Chat TPT to show me how to register my business to accept HSA after spending, like for Christmas time, that might be a good thing.
00:47:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
of year. Yeah, I love that. And do you have targets? So you should talk to Mark and see if he thinks that you and Dan might be a good match. Dan doesn't just take everybody really what he does is he builds the websites. And the reason for that is because the speed, he needs to control the assets so that we can get really clean data. And that's, he built this whole thing for that purpose because it's really hard to get accurate tracking, but ads don't work very well if you don't have accurate tracking. So, he does that and he just likes puzzles and he, but he's very good at running Google ads in a way that almost nobody does. It's very low cost. So, anyway, it's interesting like when I first told Mark about this business, I actually, because you see how much I can afford to spend on this.
00:48:33 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I was actually, I actually went to Mark and said, know, should I hire someone to do my website, hire someone to do my marketing. And I thought Mark was going to say like, yes, yes, and he actually made me think about it a little differently that like, what is your business really? And so this business to me was like, it's really just a marketing play, right? I'm not, I don't own the brain scanner. don't own the game. the report maker, the brain key report maker, I'm just the reseller. And Mark was saying, you know, you should have at least a beginning understanding of how to create a website, create a payment processor, and also how to, you know, run a base Google ads because he's like, he was telling me like, he can't tell me how many millions he's freelessly spent on. That's exactly why right there. And he said, like, once you, you know, once I figure it out, when I run a couple campaigns, then I can go out and hire, you know, really cool people. But he's like, you need to understand the core of your business. And I was like, okay, so yeah, that was actually that was my plan is to actually run, you know, one campaign, maybe put $10,000 in it and run it on Alzheimer's.
00:49:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so I understand. You know, want to tell that was funny.
00:49:51 - Fujinaka, M.D.
No, so that's not even that.
00:49:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's why I wouldn't recommend anybody but Dan. And he is not the best. at creating the campaigns. He is the smartest when it comes to conserving money. The thing about all advertising agencies are they are, you will bleed out the jugular.
00:50:13 - Fujinaka, M.D.
That's how bad they are.
00:50:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Mark is right because when you understand the technicality of what's involved and they want to give you a $10,000 a month fee, you're going like for what? For why? No. Now if you want $10,000 and you got me a million dollars. Okay. Right. Or you know what I mean? Or even $100,000. 10% marketing fee is totally accessible. But most of them are just ridiculously priced and you have no concept of it. Most people have no concept of it because they've never done it. So now you have, and Mark would tell you if he thinks it's, I would be curious to know what he thinks.
00:50:52 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I haven't run the campaign yet. I'm probably going to try to do that next week.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yes, you should. that everybody that does business for themselves should know a little bit about all the things really should. And the reason I have the business I have is because I did all the things. I've done graphics, I've done web design, I've done programming, I've done building the products, I've taught, I've done all the things. And so when I go with somebody, what's that?
00:51:23 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Oh, hold on. I was saying, yeah, I think that's a great idea to talk to some of Mark's contacts. Once I run my first campaign to try it, I like it.
00:51:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we keep kidding.
00:51:36 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Like, it keeps coming out and I don't know if it's my internet or yours. Oh, I think I need to stop the share here. There we go.
00:51:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so, I mean, okay, we're almost out of time. I want to make sure that we use whatever and cover whatever you want. But what I, you have other businesses, let me go to my notes, because I would, wanted numbers on everything, even Esther's businesses, if you want. would love to look, because here was the main goal, right? How do we double your revenue without really increasing your time and your workload? So that answer is always leverage and optimization. And the more things that you have that we could leverage and optimize, the easier it is to double without increasing your workload too much. So you have multiple things that could be leveraged. I would love to see the stats in a spreadsheet that I can look at with you on everything. So what we had talked about last week is anything that you could consider a KPI, right? So any revenue coming in, any expenses, where the revenue comes from, any kind of delineation that you can make between the numbers in terms of hours work to fulfill it, staff to fulfill it, at marketing sources and revenues, different price points, whatever it is between all the things we want to document the historical data, then analyze it together and formulate a plan for a small increase across the board with each of those things. then I'm pretty sure that if and then probably like I said take a few weeks because first you've got to get all the data, then we've got to analyze it, then we have to come up with a plan and then we have to see how the plan works. So it's not an immediate thing. So the sooner you sit down and capture this stuff, so that's the penalty for you is you don't have to worry about sending me money, you're not going to be making what you could be making probably pretty easily if I can't see those numbers and we don't go through this exercise. So I'll just let you sit with your losing money by wasting money, leaving it on the table. If I'm not doing the work, that's really all I have. don't have anything, any other questions other than when you get that data. So the other thing that I will tell you is once I see it all, I'm going to ask you to show me where you got it from and kind of prove that those are the real numbers and that's the accountability part. So you told me that you will answer things sometimes incorrectly according to what you think wants to be heard and I'm going to hold you to proving it. So I'm just letting you know I had a time. But the other thing is then I get to see how organized the data is, how necessarily reliable it is, what the potential is for managing it, what for growth and just kind of look over your systems because if they're efficient then they're If they're okay again not doing well, then we'll talk about that the Francis like July will you say me what you want because like I Collected the app like the P&L's and the profit and losses um, is that something that we that I should we because I can ask my bookkeepers for any kind of numbers and they can give me reports on them If if I know what to ask them So those are kind of things that you want me to start getting or like, uh, what kind of KPIs Let's start with P&L's for any business that you have and I would like them for the year and like total but then quarter by quarter. We won't go month to month and that will give us some starting things So just bring the raw data To our meeting we will dig through it on the meeting. It will be slow and it will be tedious These next few weeks are probably just kind of not be as fun as an exciting And I just want you to focus on the delayed gratification for a bit while we gather this because the planning that comes from this is really exciting.
00:56:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay, so maybe I'll just target July. So because now for July, I have quarter one and quarter two. I actually wait, are we done with quarter? So two quarters of data. So we can look at that.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we'll be almost done.
00:56:29 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I can get the monthly P&Ls and then you wanted quarterly P&Ls. Yes. Okay, maybe we'll start.
00:56:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want the whole year and then I want quarterly. Well, July, I would like monthly.
00:56:43 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Yeah, so I'll get it since January and then we can go over those next call.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds good. So, physician, physician, oh my God. Physician recruitment, why my tongue does not want to work. Um. I want to know, um, let me see how much you've given me already. I want to understand. Entry the exit for your money, like how do you earn the money? You've told me some about it, but I want to know what that if there's any leverage point, if there's anything that you can do to increase that, let me, let me start with that. Do you think that there's anything that you can do to increase that?
00:57:32 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay.
00:57:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can talk about ester stuff if you want to medical director. I want to understand deeply like, explain what that is and how the money comes to you. And then also we talked about your training. Um, Q and D like test prep, I think is what it was. And, um, we started getting data on that. And what I. I had asked for was, I wanted one spreadsheet that had the overall snapshot kind of data for each of those businesses, which is the revenue month over month, as long as you've been doing that particular business, and that would incite questions for me that I can start asking you, but I really need to be able to see that revenue and know a little bit in terms of like where it comes from. So the assignment and I would like to install the there's a repercussions for not doing it next week, because it would be a waste of our time if you don't have this we're we shouldn't it should have already been done. Is that I want that and I need to make sure that you're clear because I did ask for it before. And you can tell me if you get too busy or something like that, but I want revenue for every type of the business, so you gave me I'll just list them one more time. All right. right. All right. right. All right. All Physician Recruitment, Medical Director, and the licensing exam test prep. I want to know the revenue month over month from each of those, a description in the same spreadsheet of how you make that money. What do you have to do to get it and any kind of information that you can think of as to what you might be able to do to increase it? All of those before we meet next week and I want it, we're meeting Monday. I want to Friday. It's Friday. Wait, wait. It's Thursday. Okay. That's not fair. You're lucky. All right, you can have it by Monday morning and we'll just go into by then because I wanted to go over it, but I'm not going to work on the weekends. I got the girls this weekend, so we'll just do it Monday. So if you're prepared with all of that, then we will have a good day.
01:00:00 - Fujinaka, M.D.
call. Oh, sounds great.
01:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:00:03 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Should I keep putting time into this delta thing? Or do I need to put that on the back word?
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Does it light you up?
01:00:11 - Fujinaka, M.D.
I really like doing it. But you know, I see the money that I can make with July like we talked about and refinements to the QME. I could be better at that.
01:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's the thing about creators and visionaries. We don't usually stay on one thing really well for long without feeling frustrated, annoyed, irritated. You have to have some freedom to go other places. These are existing businesses that you've already defined and chosen. Now, if you want to say you want to go chase something else that isn't even on your plate when you've got all these things going on, like what are you doing? Stop. Focus. But it's already here that you're already doing it. nurturing it would be good. once we get to the activity, that I'm talking about and we have evaluated all of your income strains and then chosen which ones have the most leverage and then made a plan for it. Then you need to try to stay within the bounds that we've created but those boundaries don't exist right now so you know and we don't have any reason or logical placement to put boundaries in so if you've got time and you're not neglecting other duties then then explore it but you should be mindful of you know sleep routine and hygiene and family that's the only thing I would always say no matter what we're talking about. That's fair all right that's good and dirty all right it was awesome talking to you foodie hello Esther I know it's your time but I really like that and makes me happy so thanks for letting us say hi. Yes you're great all right thank you.
01:01:59 - Fujinaka, M.D.
Okay bye have a great night.

Can you hear me? Yeah. So did you said to say hi?
00:00:08 - mark sweet
Yeah, they are COVID. So he's having fun.
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what he said.
00:00:12 - mark sweet
Well, everybody but him. For now, you know how that goes. We know where this is going.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. He is awesome.
00:00:23 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Thank you for that. If Dr. B is anything like that, then I would really love to do that. No, no, no.
00:00:32 - mark sweet
No, I wish. But now.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Dan. Hey.
00:00:41 - mark sweet
Hey. Okay. Before we jump into a bunch of stuff, I just want to get some clarification on a couple of things before I forget. Okay. This is more Dan related than anything else. Okay. Valiant, TRG, et cetera, et cetera leads. Those are now no longer going to HQ intake, right?
00:00:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. And after they are no longer going there. Okay. Yeah, so only thing going there now are like. I can confirm this, but it's like 50% roughly of. One of five. And then, and then leads, and then leads when they're 96 hours old.
00:01:24 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:01:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which we could turn off.
00:01:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, the quantified there still getting the same content information we are. So we had the scene where we're both calling the same person again.
00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know how that's happening. They're saying that. They're only sending them to us. So. Stend over like the most recent emails of those people because we'll have to trace. The zaps and the automations and see if there's something, something must be up somewhere. or quantifies some of us still sending them there, but they said they weren't. I mean, I saw her response and she said, she's only sending them to us.
00:02:11 - mark sweet
Yeah, you know, SEC, Eric, too, we're just you.
00:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:18 - mark sweet
It's just, it's creating some friction and knowing that we're going to be pulling some leads. I don't want create more friction. Yeah. So if we have to just switch all quantified just to them, so be it.
00:02:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure.
00:02:32 - mark sweet
But the quantified cost per lead is shockingly low, like solid. There's some issues we got with some clients who were like, oh, I thought I was doing something else and I don't want to move forward, but that just happens. But again, given the amount.
00:02:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They convert.
00:02:55 - mark sweet
They convert and their cost per position is low. So now it's like doing also one. And now try the Utah thing again and with just them.
00:03:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That would be a good way to start.
00:03:08 - mark sweet
Right, because we already now have it where the Utah do this before that's just signing cases. Right. And that was their big issue.
00:03:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:03:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chocker.
00:03:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's not cool. He can do it.
00:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, really do.
00:03:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Really? Come on.
00:03:27 - mark sweet
Well, yeah, so I might try to do that because I don't think it's going to cost me more than a couple of grand a month.
00:03:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And it can just sort of seed that pipeline at least get, right? Because the next thing is, how does that dude handle a case, right? unfortunately, you're not going to be able to see how he manages it. But here's the benefit. It's Salko's thing. So if it doesn't go bad, you know who's going to freak out. It doesn't go good.
00:04:01 - mark sweet
I mean, he'll lose his , which is perfect Because I'm wondering if we should just switch back and just have HQ intake just Oh, and then just do all quantify including Utah yeah, and that way there's not I mean, I don't they seem to do particularly well with those leaves.
00:04:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't get it But that is Certainly the way it looks right.
00:04:36 - mark sweet
I'm sure if we dove into the map it would back it up Right.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand it, but it is what it is Right, and some things don't need to be fully understood I mean, that's that's a simple fix. mean then we don't even need to figure out what's wrong Yeah, we should do that Texting her grin Well, we're actually Stacy. I can't sit at air because I mean, we get lost, but I know he's not super busy, so.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So will HQN take be doing any other leads?
00:05:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They do the 96 hour old leads.
00:05:24 - mark sweet
And the Sunday leads?
00:05:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, they still got leads.
00:05:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that volume?
00:05:37 - mark sweet
Sunday?
00:05:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and they're core.
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The 96. Yeah, the 96 has even been on a week. So it's hard to say. It used to be 72, but there's no point. We can't really go back and figure it out. So, we'd have to look at it going forward. forward and I don't know what it will be, but when they send over a report, if we look at when the 96 got turned on, I'll confirm with Eric, then it will be, you know, well, I guess, if we make this change today, so we'll have to use today as the date, or the date when Eric says, so hopefully it would technically be probably tomorrow. So if he makes up the today, tomorrow becomes quantifiable and 96, then, and Sunday, if we wait a week, pretty much whatever that number is next week is probably the number other than adding a Utah, which may or may not happen this week, but it'll be in the neighborhood. so who is the attorney for Utah?
00:06:59 - mark sweet
No, it's his name. I don't know if I'm top of my head.
00:07:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not me either. Saka's buddy.
00:07:06 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:07:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Machine comes up as So good name. Saka's buddy.
00:07:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I don't. Oh, yeah, we did.
00:07:16 - mark sweet
Okay. So he started. I want to say it's Brad.
00:07:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This.
00:07:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, great.
00:07:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I forgot about that. Yeah. haven't talked about it, but I, you started in like December, right? Somewhere around there.
00:07:34 - mark sweet
Yeah. was very bad.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's it going now?
00:07:39 - mark sweet
Like, I don't see. We stopped because it was very, very, very bad.
00:07:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's changed that we're going to be doing this now?
00:07:50 - mark sweet
Okay. Now he lets us sign for him. The issue before was he wasn't picking up. the phone, they weren't good on intake. They weren't good on intake.
00:08:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:08 - mark sweet
And so now we're able to walk around that issue, I guess, for lack of letter term, if we can just sign it up and if it drops it, it is what it is. The only sign like one or two cases, I haven't heard anything about how they're going. I'll be lucky if I break it even on those.
00:08:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then what is the purpose of being there?
00:08:32 - mark sweet
Because we spent 17,000 with Walker, quantified it significantly cheaper.
00:08:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So was break even, but now you think it could be profitable?
00:08:46 - mark sweet
If we only sign, but you might be break even. Right. But here, we're like under two granted case.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:58 - mark sweet
So. If again, better.
00:09:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'm looking at that. got to refresh this report. The Dan DD intake. Dashboard. Okay.
00:09:24 - mark sweet
He goes to quantify or something. Smaller ones work. This is a way we can expand it more. He's back. Yeah.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which one is quantified?
00:09:40 - mark sweet
Is that blue steel?
00:09:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Well, speaking of Actually, sorry, Mark, were you, did you discuss other things that you wanted to get to first?
00:09:53 - mark sweet
That was kind of the main thing.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So. Um, report updates. Dan, do we have any?
00:10:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a Stacy question. So she, she sent over the stuff that you sent. So probably not.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
mean, so she sent it over.
00:10:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. finished all the others. All the other stuff was done, but the stuff that you that we came up with last Monday, have not, he hasn't, he hasn't updated us on that. So there's probably no update.
00:10:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. Um, let's go look at this. Oh, yeah. That was my. Oh, no, haven't met with. So, okay. I'm meeting with Lauren's Wednesday. Um, and, but I talked to you Thursday instead of Monday. So, okay. I don't have anything new to report there, obviously.
00:10:54 - mark sweet
Um, this week, I'm doing a San Diego run.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:10:59 - mark sweet
What? I'm What's in Sano Sacramento?
00:11:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
San Diego.
00:11:04 - mark sweet
wouldn't love any of your cases. We've actually done really, really well with them. We just, I get your boy, Zach.
00:11:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Zach, come on buddy.
00:11:17 - mark sweet
I know.
00:11:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Although he did tell me that like, he said that. Look at what he said. I should hit him up.
00:11:27 - mark sweet
He's running the same issue. more buddies. Like he would like to send me cases. He just doesn't have a lot coming through.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And but I can't remember if he knew whether or not they already had a lawyer or it was too late.
00:11:45 - mark sweet
I wonder if we should.
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wonder if we should look at his stuff and be like. What are the issues. Like, hey, what is the status, right? car accident, right? Obviously would. Look at the ones that were car accident and then say, okay, have a lawyer, don't have a lawyer, have a lawyer, obviously, we'd be like, I'm just I know you. And then the other one would be don't have a lawyer. And then is it too late? It's probably the case is what, but I don't know. And what are the odds he's collecting all this data? I'll let him buy me some beer and then tell him how to run this business.
00:12:32 - mark sweet
He said he turned everything AI in his office. So you're not even a front desk person anymore.
00:12:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. Yeah.
00:12:43 - mark sweet
It's interesting.
00:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The ads are the automation. How's that going? All We're going to do.
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do that? don't know if we were actually doing that.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we not?
00:13:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. I don't remember if we said to do it, but if we are, it's going to go. We're going to do it. Eric's back. So Eric was on the town. So I'll queue it up. We probably put that live today too.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Would there be any reason we would not do that?
00:13:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't remember. I don't remember talking about it. I was like, he asked me. Are we doing it?
00:13:29 - mark sweet
go, I don't think we talked about it.
00:13:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anywho.
00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that was still.
00:13:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We are doing it, apparently. I don't remember saying we were doing it. I remember pitching it, but then I was like, Oh, it was pitched and approved.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My notes say Dan can create an automation that is the answer of the automation and see what happens. No. No. Let's see. So that we can now intake and close. I certainly can close.
00:13:58 - mark sweet
I think her issue was.
00:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
early when each doing take wasn't good oh yeah so we killed that that got killed on Friday too so we can now make one because all ads certainly leads as of Saturday well other than Sunday right there's still that Sunday thing but the vast majority of ads certainly leads we can now segment into their own automation we'll do that three calls in an hour yada yada yada and then they're gonna they're like they want to get out of washington they're like you guys for whatever reason washington isn't working but new mexico is so they're like we're gonna focus more on new mexico's and that's fine i'm not really hmm i'll have some with it you talk well we don't need that now no no no don't don't yeah i'm not just like just we to try to make some side money basically i don't want to be a mean focus yeah if we've got any that are very cost efficient for lower volume which is what we're seeing
00:15:04 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where is the doctor report?
00:15:09 - mark sweet
Was it America that's working on it? Yeah, you should be sure it on it.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm going with share with me. I wish I know I've seen it, but I don't. I got to start it so I can. Do you know what it's called? No.
00:15:37 - mark sweet
I would assume like doctor map or something.
00:15:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just looked up doctors and share with me.
00:15:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

I get is the American now lines coming up. Okay. I'm very different. Yeah.
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Eric looked at that that you sent over and they got sent to each cube because. The 96 hours it expired. So there's got to be. We have to look at it like we need to figure out a way to know for sure. Either they both hit and contact the person on the same day.
00:17:43 - mark sweet
But like we signed her before.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. So that means we need some sort of. So why didn't we see it as them being in contact? There's something we have to figure out. It should. a band that they were in pending contact or and then they didn't advance so we just need to figure out a way to go oh we're talking to them right um that should be pretty it's pretty cool i mean anything else i'm pending contact yeah i think a lot of times they just leave a person in pending contact but well we can let me look at it and then we can yeah what looks at it what was that i was reading i was sending up that emo who's the eric looked eric looked at that thing that even though we don't well we still need it for the 96 hours but the one that mark was like hey they double contact with them we figured out it's because it got sent to them but it technically should know but the question is how do we stop that in the future but i'll bet they're all like that yep yeah so it's like um We just got to find a signal we can use.
00:19:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is the error happening on a technology level or an intake level?
00:19:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like people, yeah, it's a people, yeah. So process, it's like a process issue, right?
00:19:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how are you solving that?
00:19:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know yet.
00:19:29 - mark sweet
I'm going to talk to you about making sure that we're only leaving pending contact when we haven't talked to them.
00:19:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Eric is saying that that's what's happening. They are leaving them in pending contact. So we just got to, I'll double check it all, but then it just might be, hey, if you're working a lead, you got to move it over and then it would be 96, then we'd come up with the different rules. So it'd be 96 hours in pending and then from working, but maybe we're not.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
we never move them. Yeah, as long as it's working, then we don't need to move it because that means we've gotten.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. He's saying that's the problem. They are not moving it.
00:20:10 - mark sweet
Okay, I will talk calling people that your entity team is already working with because of this. Okay, got it. And so they're like, well, she's not there.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. um, No, I ran it down. So Patty's back from vacation. She hasn't left with the baby yet. When she leaves, it's going to be six months. I don't think that I wrote down when she's leaving.
00:21:03 - mark sweet
Two weeks.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the same thing. Okay. When that's that. Like 24 or something.
00:21:17 - mark sweet
Basically, I'm on.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Another month. Okay. So, um, did you guys work on the intake script?
00:21:28 - mark sweet
And we're going to meet today to go through it a little bit more.
00:21:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's the level of progress? Do you think out of like?
00:21:45 - mark sweet
closer. I just, they have the basics of the script. I just want to work on our. Objections, I guess.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's important. Good afternoon. Anything that's a friction point should, like, you want to thoroughly, basically create as many guardrails as possible that your team can recognize, oh, this is the friction point, this is the trigger, therefore this is the response or the way that I need to handle it, and then, like, if they're not really good at doing it consistently, maybe some type of role play activity, because call control and call flow is, you can't script everything, but that practice and that immediate feedback of, okay, this is how you should handle that, this is how you should handle that, creates this muscle memory, but also creates confidence that they may not. don't have in dealing with something, because there's so many different things to process, the person on the other end, energy, their tone, what experience they had, your person, the mood that they're in, all these different things. So you want to try to make things as reflexive as possible where they don't even have to think about it. They know how to recognize this situation gets this response so that it just becomes habit and reflex. But you want everybody to have the same reflexes and obviously there's a, there's skill, you know, there won't be perfect consistency across the board, but it can be engineered to be probably a lot better, but I haven't listened to the calls. I actually keep reminding myself to do that. have to log into lead flow, but I don't have a lead flow rate access yet, I think. is my issue. Hold on a second, let me check. Dan, that's what it's called, right? Lead slowly, that's what I would look at, login security code. I did get that. Okay, I care to login. Okay, so that's what I want to do so that I can kind of add some feedback to that. Because managing call flow is something I've had lot of training and experience and it's been a long time in the corporate world, but it all, it's all the same for the most part.
00:24:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, it is all the same.
00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, people being people. Okay, you guys are working on that. Do you have anybody on the NTA team that, I mean, when's last time you listened to NTA calls?
00:24:54 - mark sweet
Well, I mean, I'll go and sit and listen to them, but to actually like to sit and go through the recording step by step is going to walk.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wanna buy a while? Six months. Okay, that's not that bad.
00:25:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been a year for me.
00:25:13 - mark sweet
Because it was like December, January that I got ticked off and that's where it's been about six months. Right. when it comes to my digging instead.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me go back. Where do I have the intake team written down? Used.
00:25:30 - mark sweet
Oh, so just the sort of an FYI will pass these out. splitting our role in two.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told us that last week. I got that.
00:25:40 - mark sweet
Feel comfortable with that at least.
00:25:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is good. Between I wrote it down, I just looked at it. So, but yeah. Um, so who, who, oh, I'm Maria Mia. Who is there anybody else besides those, those two want to take?
00:26:07 - mark sweet
That are going to be running it now.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So they're running it for her. Okay.
00:26:15 - mark sweet
think we had a Zavato Marco, Jalissa Jose.
00:26:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was the first name before Marco?
00:26:27 - mark sweet
A Zavato?
00:26:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A Zavato? Okay. And. How long? Let me see because I'm going to just go put this in my spreadsheet with the firm. Name this. This intake. How long has each one done working with you? Yeah.
00:26:54 - mark sweet
Uh, me has got to be on like here. Three or four at this point. Maria has been with us for at least a year. She's the only one with a college degree and she's a very detailed specific, so she's going to be good at breathing the biles. Jelissa's been with us for about a year and a half, she's going to law school next year. Jose has been with us for eight months, I think. Marco's been with us for close to a year. Is all those new? think he's on month three.
00:27:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, let's see. Marco was how long. As well, though. One three, you said.
00:27:53 - mark sweet
Yeah. Yeah, he knew.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then Patty, and stay one. Right.
00:28:08 - mark sweet
No.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No.
00:28:14 - mark sweet
She's been around since 2019.
00:28:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, let's see what's. So, I know when I last updated this. If you can rank them. Scale one to 10. How would you write each of them? One being the worst.
00:28:45 - mark sweet
Yep. or anything specific.
00:28:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could, we could write them according to certain data types. If that would mean the more information I have about them, the better. And the more ways that you're. evaluating them and looking at them the better.
00:29:03 - mark sweet
Yeah, so let's use Jose because he's kind of the most polarizing one. Okay, he's very good at closing on the phone, but he is not reliable, not detail oriented, and can't rely a lot. The next one, let's go to Jalissa. She's smart, but she's just here for a paycheck now and she's going to law school. So she does her job, she doesn't do anything beyond her job. She's mid-level, I guess I would say. She understands what to ask and kind of understands what clients are doing, but not around for a long time so she knows what she's looking for and she's developing a pretty good gut of like what cases to take which ones not to take which is good. Still needs work to help though on closing cases. Azvaldo is new so he's still just trying to make sure he figures out you know what we're doing. Not a slight on him it just takes time of course. But he wants to learn he wants to listen to calls so he's you're going learn to get better. Marco is like a B plus decently on closing cases could be a little bit more aggressive on the phone and a little bit of a lack of detail. And then Patsy I think we kind of all know where she's at. Again I think she's a little weak on closing cases but she's pretty good on what's taking what not to do. And then Maria is only one I forgot. Maria is very detail-orienting, weak on the phone or weaker on the phone, I should say. She's much more about order taker.
00:31:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now you know who's calls to listen to Tina, and in what order? Although, actually, you can't tell who's remembering.
00:31:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You to learn their voices. I'm pretty good at that. Let's see. Okay, so you gave me those details, which are really great, but now I would like you just to write them overall scale of one to 10. Go Patsy first. Let's give her a seven. Maria.
00:32:00 - mark sweet
Five.
00:32:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:32:04 - mark sweet
Six.
00:32:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jelissa. Five. Jose.
00:32:15 - mark sweet
He's anywhere between the two and a thing.
00:32:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I really do. think on the day.
00:32:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:32:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
depends if he's had a snack or not.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god. Does he show up You might want to include that information. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Part is to replace and take people by the way that we've had this conversation but it's been a while.
00:32:53 - mark sweet
They get burned out.
00:32:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
really don't want to do it. Yeah. Okay. Marco. Hello.
00:33:02 - mark sweet
Marco, I would say six and a half.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, although it's still new, but let's rank him as a newbie. As far as like previous new people.
00:33:20 - mark sweet
I mean, if I got to just put him on a scale, I put him at a, you know, a four. I think knowing that he's new, I would put him closer to, you know, the sixth, seven range. I think he could be the long term.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For six. That's, that's good. No, wait that. Um, whoa. Hate when I click on something and Excel about like disappears. I'll use my place.
00:33:50 - mark sweet
Right. But obviously those are, yeah, some swings there.
00:33:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Okay, I'll just ponder that for a while, because that's the only thing that my brain can do right now, and that would be not a fun conversation, because I wouldn't be talking, I would just be thinking. Okay, I'm going to think about that. Let's see.
00:34:18 - mark sweet
They're highly incentivized at their goals so they're definitely motivated that way, but the one thing I do like about them is, they don't try to twist cases to try to design it just to try to have a goal.
00:34:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good.
00:34:41 - mark sweet
But their incentive is all tied to each other right so it's a team goal because when we try to do individual night, it became problematic of who signed what because look at the people talked to a client. So it just, it was just better to do a team goal. It cuts down on. on the issues significantly.
00:35:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there, and this is just things to contemplate for maybe some kind of separation and reward for individual performance, like even just, and because I have to think about how we can do this, obviously the HR rules and the things that you can specify and can't, but just punctuality, like is there anybody that's chronically late or leaves early or not back from lunch on time, things like that where you can, rather than penalize, just reward people for never being that or that type of Yeah, I honestly don't dig into that as much as I should.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
They're generally there when we're supposed to be within five or 10 minutes. So the only one that we've got issues with this goes in.
00:36:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do they, they're not salary that early, right?
00:36:19 - mark sweet
So they, they log in. Correct, except pass it.
00:36:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you ever look at their login reports?
00:36:29 - mark sweet
No. I mean, they come in, they have to scan their thumb. So I know when they're here, but, you know.
00:36:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you've never reviewed their login reports.
00:36:39 - mark sweet
Only if there's an issue, then you should bring it up to me. And Patsy is pretty good at telling it that someone's got an issue.
00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then do they stay in the same state all day? it just either like a time card like you're here? And not here, or do they have break periods where they, um, um. Like if they're going to lunch, do they log out for lunch? What's that with like?
00:37:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's regular hourly. So at the end, clock out for lunch, come back, clock back in, 14 minutes.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And paid breaks are not a separate anything. It's just going break and tell somebody, like, how does that work, too, for breaks?
00:37:21 - mark sweet
They just have their 10 minute breaks.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And nobody's looking to see if 10 minute breaks turn into 30 minute breaks or 40 minute breaks.
00:37:34 - mark sweet
No, again, if there was an issue, well, it's your path to say something to me.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I hear that. But I hear about it. Well, and define issue and define does Patsy even want to deal with it? Like, let's say it's, what does it say to me? Hold on, it's the, yeah, it's the drunk. Good. Right.
00:38:01 - mark sweet
That's definitely more than annoyed.
00:38:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so any, but attention to detail and even caring about things, you know, it's, so what gets on path to these radar, for example, is the only thing that's on a radar is, hey, there's calls and nobody's answering them. Now I'm going to look around and see what people are doing, or is she in the habit of looking around and saying what people are doing. So to the point of the quality of team and who's showing up and being active and doing things, especially if they're all getting the same incentive, which totally with that type of behavior seems wildly unfair and demotivating, which is why you have to catch other things that you can reward if you can't separate this type of thing. But, but is, you know like if I show up and I'm on time every single day and I never go over all my breaks or rarely right and I am not abusing time and I'm showing up and I'm doing a good job and maybe I'm not the best person but I try my best and then there's this drunk that comes I gotta watch my mouth but that comes in and he's late and he's belligerent or rude or lying or whatever and like we're all getting the same reward and like nobody cares that he's just screwing around because he does it one more slow so like nobody's noticing but he's just hanging out like I'd be annoyed so um dealing with something because there's an issue is not high level leadership and management do you know what I mean that that's reactive is anybody paying attention and trying to optimize things like just the way people show up and act and and how they punch in and whatnot and I don't know what level you at that to me. It's not micromanaging. It's just understanding. It's inventory, right? Human resources are part of your business. And you've got an entire team of six, seven people here that nobody's paying close attention to. It's passing listening to their calls regularly.
00:40:22 - mark sweet
I got it.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's like no quality control here in solid leadership or management on team of seven. That's a huge thing. Yeah. So, you know, we're really starting to get a lot of other things. Either under control or we're building a framework around it to to kind of, you know, putting the guardrails, putting the framework in and taking a look at it. intake, from the beginning when we've asked questions, it's just been kind of like like it is what it is, type, answer and response.
00:41:04 - mark sweet
It's hard to find people to work it and not to burn down for sure, but it definitely needs improvement.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and I feel like we're at a point now because we go in cycles, right? Where sometimes our calls are super focused on one particular thing and we're fleshing it out and like we end the call and there's still lots of stuff to talk about. And then there's periods where like there's not a ton because it's all getting worked on and this is one of those periods where we've got room to be talking about other things and digging into it a little. It is a frustrating thing and it's going to take some extraction and we're gonna have to work hard to figure out what we can do because of the nature of it. But if you're willing to just kind of wrestle with us a little bit and try to figure out what we can do. I think that it's a critical part of your business and it deserves that effort. Even if it's not clear and there's no clear path, I would like us to be spending a little more time working on it. I do think now is a good time to do it. Now isn't like not just today, but like, you know, maybe for the next few months.
00:42:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree.
00:42:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I think if you get a script in place, right? All the calls I listen to, all of them were way too long because they didn't pre-qualify the person when they got on the call. So burnout. I could see burnout coming from. Oh my God. have to listen to this person recount this accident that has no me, no purpose with me being on the phone. That would drive me nuts. But it's there. it's the process is what's causing that. It's like that that that would get eliminated. So if that's a factor, that fact can get eliminated.
00:43:08 - mark sweet
So somewhat, I mean, they get a lot of abuse, and unfortunately, too, you know, only tell people that we can.
00:43:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, I see some of comments.
00:43:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, so, you know, that's an unfortunate part of what we do. And that's just that's been ever going to take up in part of like, that's just the nature of the people or else. Sometimes you can't change that.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't, but you can't train and help your team know how to handle that. Has that been done? Like, I know we did black, you have black phones. I don't know how helpful it was with that. And you've also had grief counseling, but what kind of training has your team had in terms of dealing with and redirecting difficult people on the phone?
00:43:59 - mark sweet
Just the black. on stuff. And then again, giving them solutions. You know, I'm sorry, we can't help you, but here's a place you can go to, which is really the state bar website for, you know, from there. So at least try to help them in some way, shape or form of at least to go to.
00:44:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Maybe you could turn it into a positive and be like, all right, Karen, call it the month award goes to so-and-so. Oh, I got the best one. I got the best . You're like, great, you get a new withstanding money.
00:44:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, we could just get a trophy that I turned that frown upside down.
00:44:50 - mark sweet
Don't use the trophy with a big butt on it or something. Like, you got the, you talk to the forward.
00:44:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Instead of the talking.
00:45:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, there are, there are soft skills.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You get the plushy.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And our soft skills, sometimes it can be learned and people can be empowered, which is respectful and erupting. And it doesn't always happen. But first of all, it starts with a frame of mind of just knowing, look, this, this is a thing that has to happen and that you're not being rude by coming somebody else, because the whole point of why they called is to get help with what they want. Occasionally, maybe you have somebody calling just because they want to complain and they're angry or they're lonely, I suppose that's possible too, because any type of dealing with the public, you're going to get some of that. But for the most part, the person called because they had a goal to accomplish. And if the intake person keeps that in mind, this person called me because they have a goal in mind. My job is to help them accomplish that goal and also to remind them because they're, they're going to be emotional and they're going to be distracting. did once they start talking about things that they had a goal in mind. Your goal is you got an accident and you want to get help for it. So the problem is the things that you're telling me right now are preventing me from helping you accomplish that goal. So if you don't mind, let me pause you there. I'm going to ask you this question and then oftentimes even belligerent people will be redirected. Now, if you ask them that multiple times, you can empower your people and say, look, sir, I've asked you three times for this. I really need this to be able to help you. If you're not ready to talk about that, I totally understand. How would you call us back when you want to discuss it or something like that? I don't know that you can do that, but my point is that there are things that can be trained and processes and you have to kind of weigh like what's it going to cost you? Obviously, there's a game to play and you can't be just getting rid of any difficult people. But I don't know, and I will listen to some of the calls, which I'm kind of dreading because that's probably going to be hours of time to really go and do that well. But to see what kind of skills they have, are people able to pause, professionally interrupt, redirect, refocus, because from what I've heard from Dan, that probably isn't happening really well. So anyway, just going through this, even if it's again 5%, 10% improvement, and maybe the improvement is not only on how long the calls take, but also reducing stress for your team. If this is a high burnout job, you know, if Sweet Law could be a place where you, people, your intake team is like, I don't want to go work anywhere else because I've been trained this. I've been. empowered to handle calls this particular way. I'm supported by getting a good intake script. We're not overly busy, like we're not just slammed with calls constantly and understaffed so that they can maximize money. Like all these different things that go into it and, you know, looking back a year from now, going, wow, you know, that's just a little bit of improvement, but I noticed it. And here's how it's reflected in the numbers. And here's how it's reflected on the team. And then we start the compounding effect of, you know, now Mia's been here six years and she's even better at this. And when we have to hire somebody new, we've got a better person to train and that type of thing. So it's like everything else. Like it's small, it seems like it's not going to make a big impact. And then you look back and you go, that was helpful. So in a very critical portion of the business. So anyway, I think you should go back and listen to some calls too if you have some downtime just maybe if you could sample a few calls from each person so that you've got something fresh in your head so that we can come back and discuss it would be good what do you think about that yeah no I need to and when do you have time for that time it's just it's one of those you need to make time we need time yeah what I'm asking is because I'd almost rather have a tooth pull and go do that maybe we just end up spending a call doing it together I don't know but um I want to be prepared when you start let's um maybe listen to it on the airplane traveling okay all right um so we'll try to discuss need to And our login report, something that you could share with me.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Um, I have to, Isaac would be the one who would have to pull those.
00:50:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me send you an email and just see, um, I'll see the Isaac. And that way all you have to do is say yes or no. So, okay. Yep. I'm going to make one. Okay. Uh, what, what was that? That came.
00:51:02 - mark sweet
I'm just going to ask a bit of answer.
00:51:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. I played that last. And I'll just shoot this off. All right. Oh, go back and take some files. Morning meditation. Um, Dan, you had something. Yeah. Did you send that to Mark?
00:51:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no.
00:51:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want to tell them what it is?
00:51:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yoga nidra. Are you doing yoga nidra? You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:45 - mark sweet
You should try yoga nidra.
00:51:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The yoga nidra, it's not really yoga, but it's a meditation that you do. part of it is that you set an intention, which is interesting. But you're, it's like you got more sleep when you're done with it. It takes 20 minutes and it's a little weird because you're, you're just laying down and it's, it's, um, dive in so they're like, do this. They're basically having you go through your whole body while you're doing it, like focus on different parts of your body. then at the end, it's like they do some at the end or whatever. But when you open your eyes after it, it's, you're altered, you're altered. You're like, whoa, you feel way more energized. It's like getting more sleep. I mean, that's, I picked it up from, um, Andrew Huberman, who's this book in biohacker dude. And he thought, he thought it was BS and then he started doing it. He's like, Oh my God, it's like to make a difference. And I think they studied when they're like, yeah, people are changed by doing it. The ultimate test. though was when our little friend Salco called me and he was like flipping out and he's like, dude, he's complaining about something. go, you need to try yoga, and he's like, what the hell is that? And I explained to him, he's like, I'm not going to do that. And I said, well, then whatever. I'll send it to you anyway. And I said to him, and then three days later, he's like, dude, he was so freaking out about something. He's like, I did it while I was in the So he legged out the airport and didn't, because I felt amazing.
00:53:30 - mark sweet
Like, told you, he also got facing the airport.
00:53:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But yeah, that's the difference. That's the difference. That's called, that's called Drumka Nidra.
00:53:40 - mark sweet
It's different. Yeah, no, I'm looking at my text messages from while in the airport, which are not appropriate for this conversation in any way, shape or form.
00:53:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, this is new.
00:53:50 - mark sweet
Mine was a while ago.
00:53:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he said he had COVID.
00:53:55 - mark sweet
He's got a COVID hangover. Because this was stampede was here this weekend. There's four groups of six Plus women who would all be quote unquote rodeos.
00:54:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, boy.
00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:54:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I think it was seven is flossing at the table.
00:54:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, lovely.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Like literally.
00:54:18 - mark sweet
No. Center for you. There's no rules. You want to drink margarita?
00:54:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
are no rules.
00:54:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Um, so the point was that we were discussing it, talking about, um, morning, you were talking about morning meditations last week. And so Dan was like, Oh yeah, I've been, I did this thing. He should do this. And so I wanted to remember to see if he told you that.
00:54:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a joke right now. So one minute.
00:54:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:54:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If you don't follow Andrew Huberman, like all of his things. Yeah, he's. Yeah. all of these things are great. Getting up and going out in the sun and doing all that stuff.
00:55:06 - mark sweet
So one of the people I work with told me this and this actually makes a lot of sense that negative emotions are used to avoid your responsibilities. many times someone's like acting out or there's a negative emotion tied to something because they're trying to avoid some kind of responsibility.
00:55:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sure, that ties in with like the whole self-fulfilling prophecy and concept which is absolutely beautiful.
00:55:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Interesting. I will say though that while I've been working on my psychology degree and it's interesting doing it at this age and the stage in life as a parent and having gone through other things that I've gone through because when I first went to school, you know when you're when you're young, you're institutionalized, you're trained. that the teachers know everything, adults know everything, and that the people that write the books know everything and that they are the and all be all authority. And I know better than that now. So going through school, but what's interesting to me is some of the books have the textbooks have said, look, this is in the book because the book had to be created, but we couldn't even agree on this stuff. It's here because this was the general consensus, but a lot of us disagree. We disagree with the, you know, the main book. Do you see it? Why can't I even think about it right now, my gosh? Anyway, but for every scientist that will tell you one thing, there will be two that disagree with them. And so that is why, too, I think that it's so important that we take the notes and, and I don't know, explore and have our own experience. I've been taking sunshine breaks for like, I don't know, 15 years. It is crazy. I sleep better. get at least 15 minutes of sun. As Fuji already told him, he needs to start writing that down, but it's wild, all of these things. There's more to try and learn than we'll ever even have time to in our lives. But if we can find back to leverage, if we can find the levers that make a significant impact, it doesn't matter if you know all the things and do all the things and we're not disciplined anyway enough to do all the things consistently, but figuring out what our Kryptonites are, what are the things, what are our coping mechanisms, what are our defense mechanisms, what are the things that we use to avoid whatever, kind of paying attention to that and create the system.
00:57:55 - mark sweet
Did I have you read switch, Mark?
00:57:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. You know what I did. pay attention to and I didn't notice that Fuji pointed out today was that that you creating the path so and this is it was just different language but I didn't realize it was in there it's what I do anyway but to the point of like we have finite willpower you can only wrestle with so many things each day so if it's a Russell to get up in the morning at a particular time if it's a wrestle to not check email if it's a wrestle to not snap but somebody that annoys the heck out of you but to wrestle to choose good food choices if it's a wrestle to you know what mean like all these different things that we have to kind of fight with ourselves to do or convince ourselves to do put forth this willpower to will ourselves to do something that we don't actually really want to do right we know that we should but we don't it's not it's not naturally what we want to do but we only have so much of that in ourselves each day. the goal then is to craft the environment where choice and will isn't necessary because there's no other options. I don't have to ask myself if I'm going to have a cookie for breakfast if there aren't cookies in the house. So I created the path a little bit differently so that I can't wander into the cookies in the morning.
00:59:24 - mark sweet
Do you know what I mean?
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, just so finding the things that make the biggest impact and then setting up our environment in such a way that the things that negatively impact us throughout the day are not in our environment so that they have less opportunity to impact us negatively which means that we've got more energy which by the way the other thing was is that it affects our cognitive ability. So every time we have to use an employee willpower to tell ourselves to do the thing we don't want to do. or not do the thing that we want to do, we have less patience and ability to even solve, let's say it's a mathematical problem. Let's say it's a business problem, a system problem, hiring problem, whatever. have finite mental resources, which is obvious, right? But to understand that we can create the environment in such a way that it optimizes our day by reducing and minimizing the rest souls that we have to have that evoke, invoke, invoke, will power. Anyway, yeah, so just one on hand. There you go.
01:00:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You got to bounce. I got to go drop the car off, get new tires.
01:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have fun.
01:00:52 - mark sweet
task. My two cents, just get whatever cost it's going to charge you and wherever you're going, make them match it, because they always will, but they'll grumble about it, but I'll save you a bunch of books.
01:01:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Alrighty. It's possible to not have the ones I wanted, but I will do that. Just right. Also, we need to meet with Patsy's husband still. Go ahead and work on that. Thanks, Black. Yep. mean, yeah. Whatever. Someone's husband. Good job.
01:01:17 - mark sweet
Okay.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you taking care of yourself?
01:01:23 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you just say occasionally?
01:01:29 - mark sweet
Uh, yeah.
01:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright, um, how's Ronan?
01:01:37 - mark sweet
Uh, adorable, but shoot up my mom's hat. So, but it's a puppy.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, this is gonna happen. don't know what she's expecting. For a couple of years, it's gonna happen.
01:01:47 - mark sweet
Yeah, but he's adorable, which is good.
01:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he still coming to the office?
01:01:53 - mark sweet
Uh, occasionally. How is your mama? Um, we've had to deal with a lot of dads. stuff so it's just been a little hard not and you know none of this is a straight border easy unfortunately so now kind of pulling back well um I went to the fight the Nate Diaz fight which was fun on saturday oh yeah throw that with whole bunch of guys so that was fun to do um one of the guys filled this way with like their family's multi-billionaires which you know it's just always interesting to see people at those high high high levels but it's still the same stuff systems and processes and people like it's just on a bigger scale um send me this one thing because it cracks me up I was on the phone I was walking back and forth on our second floor and the squirrel just comes in just like lays down on top of the roof like he's just chilling and it just probably just find it mildly funny as well but yeah it's awesome
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And me and the pool for the last two days. I'm just like, I'm not doing anything. love sun. That's why I need to be living in Arizona.
01:03:11 - mark sweet
Monday is a big day next week. So the $10 million check case should be done because they have to give it to us by the 14th. So I get it that Monday. And then I got my personal million dollar cases due on that Monday, so don't. Kind of exciting.
01:03:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is fun. So to the, you going out and hanging out with friends, I will say that one of the best things that I think anybody could do, especially through different seasons of life is actively cultivate friendships and different types, just different people and socializing and along with the stuff that you're. going through, personally, at home, with mom and everything else. Just having people who know you, who are aware of you, laughing, laughing is really, really important. Having fun, having people that are maybe in similar seasons, but also who are where you want to be. Just thinking about those, but being really intentional about making those times, making time for that, and reaching out to make those connections proactively not worrying about whether or not somebody else initiates it or not waiting for anything, but just being really intentional is I think one of the best tools and one of the best hedges, rather than a lever, it's a hedge against depression, it's a hedge against just kind of sinking. Because there's so many different things that can come up in life, and so I hope that you do lots more of that. It's good for you, and you people love you. You're a good guy, and people need you too. So that's my pitch. think that you should spend more time making friends and having fun and letting people fall in love with you. Yeah.
01:05:27 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, it's good. On the up side.
01:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
On the what side?
01:05:32 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't make you mild entertain. So we got to start out from my old law firm. And super well, what? Because it's a case that we'd already settled. So I basically say like, no attorney who signed this. So I'm not sure who to address the letter to. Obviously, I know the wrong law firm. But we've already settled the case. the policy limits. Despite, you know, fact that. I called the collision, I think, previous owner for teaching me how to turn lemons in the lemonade on these types of cases. And I used to say, so we're going to certainly send the file, and we're just going to finally need to be starting our full attorneys fees. The response I got back was, it was newly retained on our, and we'll drop. thought it could be a assistance in your training. Obviously, I would have made a different decision knowing what I learned discovery years ago regarding your employment by our firm. But that is your karma, you must work out and I'm happy I'm on the other end.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
01:06:33 - mark sweet
Yeah, I don't know exactly what that means.
01:06:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:06:40 - mark sweet
So I asked my old boss, I was like, hey, do you have any clue what the hell she's talking about? Because there's, when they got raided in the DA got involved, that was bad. And then they sued each other when they ended. So I didn't know which discovery it was. Like I read it four times, I have no idea. So I'm sure I said something at some point. point is again the reason I learned lot what I learned was because she didn't show up or she was too intoxicated or whatever. She was in a meeting to just choke drunk or high. So I took a lot of meetings and met a lot of people that I wouldn't otherwise meet because of that so it worked well but not directly if that makes sense.
01:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she was bitter and deflecting and she is bitter and deflecting.
01:07:27 - mark sweet
I'm sure I said something about it and you know at some point that of frustration whatever else and there's no excuse but more than sure I said something and so it was interesting. I tried to make friends with her when I left and she said it doesn't work that way and yeah.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well whenever life is lessons and some of them really really suck but some are really really awesome. So yin and yang I'm telling you it doesn't matter like how good things get equal opposites will happen. So the better it It gets in some ways, the worse it gets and not necessarily directly, maybe it's just like the people around you, but it's it's kind of wild to notice. But I've learned that the the fortifying power of the good is that you can see the bad happening around you, but it is less impactful. And it it it doesn't create the pain that it could have the potential to create when you fill yourself up with so much goodness. And that's been interesting and fascinating to watch too that that that bad has less power to do its thing, you know.
01:08:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, it doesn't really bother me. It's just a little strong with people.
01:08:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, there's a lot of that all day long. What is wrong with you?
01:08:54 - mark sweet
Anyway, I got to deal with the angry, dead client person action.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will talk to you later. Have a good day. I'm Mark. know you. Yep.

How are you? 00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Good. I'm trying to get on my windows up in real quick. saw you sent your assignment. I haven't got it yet. Microsoft. I'm gonna move this over to Google Docs for myself. I won't even let me copy it. Oh, dude. I don't want to go through all those steps. Um, yeah. I'll just look at it here, I guess. Um, how long did it take you to do this? 00:01:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I had a new guy that came, I basically did this with him for, believe, the other week. Yeah, because I was just explaining what we do, so I kind of already did it with him, so I just had to put it on in writing. 00:01:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, do you feel that there was anything useful about it when you did the exercise? Did you think anything? where's it just recording? 00:01:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) This is what it is. I mean, it's always good to know. Like, just get some cases to make sure that you know exactly what steps need to be done on each case. It's easy to like skip one and then. 00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like the health insurance stuff for the distributions are out like it'll come up because accounting needs those to process the distributions but I mean we did we do so many cases like you pretty much already know what needs to be done yeah and I only have two other people on my team so it's not like the tasks are broken up to like four different people yeah my gosh I hate I have a Microsoft account but I just never use it I have a PDF I might ask you to send it some other way because I actually have like three accounts I've got my school account because I'm a student I've got one for my mission and I've got my personal fun and they don't make logging in easy like you can't just anyway yeah Uh, yeah, if you would mind just copying pasting it, even into an email is fine. Oh, that should do it actually, let's see. I'm gonna try to get it signed in. Oh my gosh, always it makes me like reset my password. Chirping, oh gosh. That an allergy is my eyeball sting, sting, allergies suck. don't know you have allergies, but they suck. My little sister doesn't have a little. that's you so lucky. Everything makes my body just go bleh. right you emailing that to me yeah thank you let me open up see what i'm going to do i will make a new spreadsheet is what i think i'll we need a lot of like copy and paste in light bro calm down thank you what the heck Oh, good. Okay. I was like, it wasn't letting me crowd it. Okay, so I want to do this until I want to do it. I'm going to share my screen. So I want, that's everyone. And then I'm going to Actually, so introduction call. I'm just going to kind of do this stuff together. Um, because it'll make it easier to kind of sort and track this time. Did I do that right? I'll see does this and does them the best. Okay. So nobody is assigned to that. Oh, so he never mind. It's just in a different row. Um, sending defendant insurance. 00:06:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia does that. Okay. 00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sometimes the formatting like breaks in between things. Like this. Okay. Cynthia, he does it best. The job doing us by the way and thank you for that. That'd be helpful. Well, she and Cynthia are able to do the same. Okay. I'll see limits, other policy limits level is that or same level. Never mind. Okay. I'm trying to like fry in my brain. I got like four hours of sleep and not for good reason. I mean, kind of it's tucked in my sister and we're ridiculous cackling into like one o'clock in the morning, like 12-year-old, but making red jokes like 10-year-old. 00:07:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's plenty of to wake up in the morning. 00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, 540. So that's who worked out so well for me. I'm a little punch drunk, Patrick. But it's okay. She had to get up at four o'clock. 00:07:54 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) She works at a methadone clinic. 00:07:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She's a nurse and she has a 45-minute drive. I have to, when she comes home, she's going to be dead driving on these windy roads. I kind of, I know kind of like, I do feel bad about that, depending on what the call is regarded. Right. See. Soon. And now this is tedious. I'm just doing this and that seems always full of the time, but it's not because formatting it will just do some things I want to get into kind of creating a structure for time. Okay. And this will be better for kind of visualizing it and making a correlation to case-in-case volume. My daughters' birds are going nuts, it's got parakeets, okay, let's see, so introduction call. now bear with me because systems optimization, all of this is a case-by-case kind of process, right? So there are fundamental things that I look for and ways at approaching it, but it gets customized is for multiple reasons, team, time, and also the person who's running the system or the people who are running the system. So, for example, I know you don't want to read books. There are, you're not the only one. I use this example because it's the first thing that comes to my mind of, like, Mark, I wanted to have him do a gratitude practice just to help him be in a more positive mindset because it works really well. He's like, Tina, he tried for a few weeks. didn't really push back. He just really didn't do it. He's like, it's not really my thing. I said, that's you got to tell me that because, you know, just because I suggested doesn't mean I think I know all the things and it has to be one way. It has to be the way that you will do it, the way that you can buy into it. If you don't buy into it, you're not going to do it. You're not going here. Continuing client. Elsie does this and does it best. Okay, we'll go back here. I can tie. Does it best? Okay, and client doctor. gonna guess that's also Elsie. Patrick and Elsie depending on what the calls regarding. Oh wait, I put that in there. I'm gonna just didn't get it actually there. Now this is why putting things in a good format to begin with, which I did not specify as far as she might have actually, but it's okay. Just because later. So Um, preparing demand letters, why I know you just have to do that. That's Mark wants you to do that. Right. 00:12:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Uh, all the attorneys right there demands. 00:12:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. We just had the conversation screw looking at AI demand writing services, negotiating and finalizing new settlements, doctor reductions and distributions. Now, I know that at least the distributions can be done by someone else. What about not necessarily on your team that you have somebody on your team that can do this, but these things could be done theoretically by someone else, right? Doesn't have a turning. Okay. At knowing who's on your team and definitely don't think anybody else would be. That's what is that? So one, two, four, what did I do? Yes, property damage. Copy and pasting would not be that difficult. Patrick, right, I'm just not. OK, all right, um, let me go into little bit a real question. Do not update the password. That's how I get locked out a bit of I could use. There's some stupid things. See. Is that this one? If I mess this up, I'm taking that out to you and I think it might be just one refresh. I the last 60 days or not. Actually, I think I want to know I want reset the parts. How would you be by attorney? All of the cases like attorney are matters by team. And then team Patrick. So you have 114. Oh. Then, let's set up 22 negotiations. What's it? 00:15:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It's one we like to disperse the money, but we keep a little bit, as we're still waiting on something. Like a health insurance link to pay, but we can distribute the client funds and take our portion without having to like wait for it. 00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm to do one more thing. So, Mark just took some of your cases right and put them somewhere else. 00:15:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, we saw some things too. 00:15:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hank, right, okay. How many? I have a number of that skewed, so let me text Marco because I need him to give you guys a report and I keep forgetting to ask Mark. Hey, when are you going to get me a report that the attorneys can look at with all the stats I asked about? Like weeks ago. I need a saucy face. Whoops. Come on, man. I'm dictating. Okay, so I need that because this should have a correlation to the closed date. But it'll be interesting to, let's see how we made that correlation. Again, I know that it seems like a very scattered frame, but this is the time that we spend creating the process and kind of putting structure on where the time goes is worth it. And it is kind of, I don't know, not just like it's disjointed, like there's trying to wrap around everything. So I'll see, I'll see. Cynthia, Cynthia ordering final medical records, initial documents, sending different insurance inquiries, um, and or policy limits. I also need people's time reports. okay. So Cynthia works in the office or at home or, okay. They're both in the office. And she's there every day. 00:18:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Cynthia, I'll see why it's a week is home. 00:18:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm just going to put nuts for myself. I'm just getting like overall operational structure so that I wrap my head around it. So do you think that you have a ballpark average estimation of how long these particular tasks take average, right? Obviously, there will be outliers, some that go very quick, some go very long. If I put a column here, do you think that you could give that? 00:19:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that just like property damage, like let's say just for one client, it could be like over the period of like two, three weeks to get it done? 00:19:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so here's what we'll do because time has to be We'll go to complete, like so, or phase, because I kind of like these different phases, and then um, estimated time, um, like, minutes, hours spent, like this task type, right? So, like, how, ordering the policy limits, I mean, like anything where you've got to call insurance, sometimes those calls, like, take a while, right? chasing clients down, and so I know that that's not going to have a real number two, but it'll give me some kind of ballpark, and it'll help, it'll just help in the mental process of kind of creating this, and then trying to figure out basically what is the best type of flow throughout world. the day in terms of like blocking types of tasks. And then also looking at it and going, how often do we need to go through this cycle for all the cases that you have so that we're not waiting two or three weeks before we check on the next thing? Does that make sense? Because I don't think right now that you have anything where you do that, like where you look at a checklist, basically, and everybody just mentally goes through a checklist. The problem with that is we are statistically human beings are terrible self reporters. So if you mentally are saying you went through the thing, right, you don't check on it, you don't look at something, we're going to forget or assume the other thing is, it's like the bystander effect that that we assume that somebody else has done the thing. As as Especially if there's a thing where there's, there's two people who do it. So I'll see in Cynthia. I'm like, oh, well, I'll see mine is done then or whatever. So if we have a list and we just kind of go through it and and you've got a list of your cases, checking off whatever things are done. And then whatever stage that we're in now. Do you have something like that in Lidified that has all of these statuses. Yeah, I didn't think so. Okay. And you don't have anything that that you could just go through and say it's in this section. It's in this status. It's in this status. Right. And can some of these be happening simultaneously? Yeah. Okay. So that's another thing that I want to know. So, um, um, can happen. currently it so we'll do that and I'm going to let's see yeah okay so let's see the concurrent first introduction calls obviously it's first thing one of the things can be happening whoa at the same time let's go down that row confirming coverages and liability I feel like that's kind of its own thing that has to happen first and then true it has to happen so none of these like these are all standalone right and then yeah assessing property damage you can probably be working on that while you're setting up for treatment yep okay so this is not for let's see let's say that can happen I'm going do number three for sending defendant insurance inquiry request or D&D. That can also happen, right? Same time-ish. You don't have to wait for setting up treatment and property damage to do sending defendant insurance inquiry or do you? 00:24:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So typically you wouldn't be doing the treatment if you're sending those insurance and because basically we're trying to see if there's any insurance. 00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so this goes before treatment? 00:24:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so I'm going to cut these, bring them down here, drag everything up, change this. Okay, let's go through the order then first in case there's anything else that can't be done before the thing above it. Can you hear these first? Yeah, I got to make sure the doors are closed next time. 00:25:33 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. It looks like no, it's in order. 00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, now it's an order. Okay, so one, two, the defendant. Insurance inquire request or DMV insurance chart request. So that will disregard the numbers. Actually, I'm going to go like this. One. Hey, that's not what was supposed to work, dude. Appreciate that. Okay. So any defendant insurance, um, is there anything else that happens with this or is that like preliminary that has to be done before we get to the next steps. 00:26:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, I guess you can do the intro call and stuff or it would already be done. 00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, so do we need to change this order again? 00:26:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) No, I mean, typically the intro call would be done at that point. The intro call is like the first thing. So. 00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So do we send the this before confirming or are they. 00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It kind of does in techno can't be so like you do the intro call and you know, you they don't have the defense insurance information Actually number four order initial documents as police reports you would put that before setting defendant insurance thing Okay Could Since it's both Cynthia, okay, what else So ordering policy limits medical referrals You can do those simultaneously Okay 00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) five, six. I'm just going to do this together, five, six. Okay. Um, what else? 00:28:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) seven, eight, nine and six can all be done together. 00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) six, seven, eight, two, one, two, five, ten. Wait, now that's right. Oh, I'm thrown off because the rest of that. Oh, that's why I'm sorry. Never mind. This is definitely its own thing, own thing, own thing, own own thing, right? property damage weight. 00:29:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Property damage you can do with five, six, three. 00:29:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. Then can three be done with five and six also. 00:29:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:29:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, because what I mean when I. say done with it is like basically it's not contingent, like you can't, you don't have to wait for anything. Okay, just want to make sure we're on the same page. Okay. So, do you feel like most of the work is done linearly, like people thinking that it's this step, then this step, rather than here's all the things that we could be doing for this case right now, what do you think is more likely that is happening? 00:30:38 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Probably like step by step. 00:30:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, just this right here would probably could probably really help the flow of the cases. Knowing how many cases you have now, here's what I don't know is how long it takes and how much waiting there is and how good it is, but. What I would guess is that there's a lot of time people are just not really working super hard and at stuff and sitting there just thinking about the cases maybe and just glancing at the records and not really pushing it forward. What do you think? Do you think that because obviously I'm not, I don't want anybody. I'm making a wild assessment. 00:31:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm sure there's like times in the day where it's just like things slow down. Obviously, happens with me too. But I do think like some of these things like policy limits, like that takes like five minutes. You know, so it's like, let's say you're, or you just got off a long call and you don't want like take a call right now or something. You don't want to make a call. could like do the policy limit real quick. It takes five minutes. You just didn't put the info. 00:32:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's where I'm getting out with this. And this is my hard- slide that people don't really like, but you'll have no problem with your team. don't know. And and also you're kind of laid back. So if you're not looking at it this way, but my guess would be, especially based off of the conversations I've had with Mark about how things go, is that there are probably several gaps throughout the day, every day of the week, where not much is getting done and could be getting done. Because if you have 116 cases, and most of them are in a status of needing to get something, there are probably 116 calls that could be made somewhere in the team throughout the day. they're hourly, right? You're not, right? Or are you hourly? No, but they are, right? Um, I would bet that all the billable time is not used very effectively or, um, I would just bet that there was a lot of just about 10% level effort. Being put, and this isn't talking about your team statistically. I'm talking about people in general. And I think part of the nature of it is not necessarily laziness or unwillingness to work. I think it is the volume of things to do and the mental effort. And I think it's a lot. I would not do this job. This would be tedious. I would hate it. But, you know, that's me, I didn't go into this. but what I think could happen is if we work through this for a little while, go through it with Lorenz and get an idea, I would love to see you do is kind of create some structure and say, look, here's the list of cases that we have, even if you put it in a spreadsheet and if you're using Microsoft Office, you probably have a sweet lot account, right, with Microsoft. So, it's secure. Everything stays on your own drive, stays, you know, where only sweet lot people could get to it. You could check it with Lidify. You could have some other kind of identifier. don't know if Lidify doesn't have, like, case IDs. does matter IDs. Okay. that would get really confusing. I feel like I'll ask Mark if we could do this. And based off of other work that we've done together, I feel like he would be okay with that. And I'll show him this and see what he thinks. But honestly, I think that this could be really useful across all of Sweet Law. Because just the mental taxing effort of trying to track all the different, like you only have 160, but 116 is a lot. And some of the other teams have 300, you're going to have more. And whatever state that they're in, somebody needs to be checking to see, is it waiting on us? Is it waiting on them? If it's waiting on them, one was the last contact point. If it's more than 24 hours or two business days or whatever, you deem appropriate that we do follow up. So just going through a checklist of here's the things that have to get done. Here's the list of cases. Here was the last touch. So then there were be another column that's okay so like we would have this as a checklist while people just kind of get used to it like oh yeah I could be doing this here's all the things that have to be done and there's a spreadsheet with all the matters on it and then so I really want to see what you guys look at letify what do you do and letify what do you guys record and letify what do you use it for everything like the whole case is on there yeah so all the notes um so like you could go in here like click the matter yeah so this is what I see when I open the case so there's highlight activity can I click on activity I mean I can but so it'll show the last time somebody We touched it, but not necessary. I tried to call and nothing happened, right? 00:37:07 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, you could pull like left a voicemail still pending, whatever. 00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. timeline. No. How would you, um, like, no, what's the, what's going on? Yeah. What's the last thing that happened? 00:37:32 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Who, who touched it last? So, on the left side, this big, like, paragraph, how you do it there first. Okay. 00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, yeah. So these are all the notes. 00:37:49 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) These are, they use this side for like, made, like bigger points. Like she's got an injection. So I want to know like that. And then on the right side, the, um, the activity. But if you scroll down, these are more like calls, email the sent out, things like that. 00:38:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so let's you look at both. OK, let's just let's just run through these real quick and look at something. So this was last touch yesterday. We're going to go like boom, boom through a lot, really quickly. Last touch three months ago. OK, tell me what we are going look at to go. Why was this only the last note three months ago? 00:38:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Can you go to the conversations? I know he's still treating, so we could sound like a follow-up text just to keep it on the I loop on what's going on with the case, but he's still in treatment. 00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So, um, do you know when treatment is supposed to be over? 00:39:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Um, can you scroll up to the damages? 00:39:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And tell me like, scroll over here and then the far left. Oh, here. Click on it. 00:39:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) This doesn't total it for you, huh? But it should, because you are trying to hit policy limits, right? 00:39:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) It does on the other page. But this. Yeah. Okay. Right. 00:39:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There are total damages. And. And where does it say what the policy limits are here? 00:40:04 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, if you go to insurance on it right there. So it's 150. 00:40:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I'm 50,000. 00:40:16 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) OK, so that's not likely. would think to hit a policy limit. So then, um, um, I'm not sure how much more I'm to do under this. Yeah, so it again, I know this much, right? So I'm just asking questions. How would you know? I mean, OK, you know that he is in treatment, but if there's no contact for three months, how do you know that they're still going? 00:41:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) you know that they haven't so is there a time period that a person can stop going for treatment that affects the case yeah more so in the beginning like if they don't go to treatment like a month and it's like the big red flag but not later it kind of depends but like if they're waiting for a surgery or something it's obviously going to take some time to schedule it and stuff like that but so as long as the initial doctor's assessment is there that has said these are all the things that they need they kind of have a window a significant window to accomplish it like basically they should be going consistently up until like the pain management visit after that it's like take some time to schedule injections or surgeries or things like that so there's some like I guess there, but like initial appointment, there shouldn't be any gaps really. 00:42:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So is there a reason why it wouldn't make sense to have at least a monthly follow up with somebody or every couple of months at a particular stage help me figure out like, if you were to look at this and just make sure you're on top of it and not assuming that things are going a particular way, what could you do that's not really bugging the client but is being proactive and making sure that things are going along a schedule? 00:42:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Like a quick text? Yeah. Every 30 days or something? 00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Do you think that that's reasonable to at least have your team attend every 30 days? Okay. So we're just going to put this down here, attend. Well, so let's say we don't hear back for every 30 days. So let's say, okay, it's in 30 days, we send a text message. If we don't hear back, then do we check a week later and just keep doing it every week until we do hear back, just to make sure that we're still connecting? 00:43:18 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:43:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, let's see the text. Um, in the case with no contact. Um, well, I'll say example, in treatment. Really, that's probably the only thing, because everything else you'd be talking to a doctor or insurance, or you need to be talking to them about distributions, right? So this would probably be the only time that there's just an okay period to not be talking for a while and not managing the time. 00:44:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Is that correct during treatment? Yeah, I mean, you want to make sure they're going and stuff, but like, there's a certain point where It's less required because like, let's say, they can appointment for like October 28 for an injection, right? Right. It's kind of like It's a month away. 00:44:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) There's no point. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What I'm saying is, is there any other status here that the case could be in where It's acceptable to not hear or not have any communication efforts for even more than a few days. 00:44:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Negotiations like I got a 30 days for the insurance to respond. So There's not really not going to be much update until I hear back type of thing. 00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. So that makes sense. Um, but if the insurance has responded, then you're in a new state. 00:45:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Anyway, right or you're still dealing with it. No, it's still negotiations, but I have to update the client on what the offer was things like that. 00:45:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I better. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So we were going back in here. Let's just go ahead and. don't want that. Look at a few more cases real quick. Last one September 13, just a few days ago. So, um, mailing insurance, companion matter, oh, um, like, incidences in the same, like, multiple people. Okay, like Yeah. Okay. Yesterday, Saturday, four months ago. 00:46:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) And this one, I texted her recently. 00:46:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. I'm stations. 00:46:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Right. Go back. 00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. And you would think that that would be more useful on the home page, just immediately there, but okay, so that's been touched. Good job. This is what we want to see though is that, that says July 24th, don't go to conversations. 18th year to go. Okay, well actually, let me ask you a question. 00:47:28 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So he's just still in treatment. 00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. I'm going to keep getting them until three months out, because it's all up, okay, three months out. I didn't pay attention to which one I was on, I'm just going to look down here. July 24th. Two months ago. So. Um, what should we look at to see, like, uh, still have back pain and decided to get that after all? Uh, that was three months ago, which I'm gonna call, yeah, I mean, that seems like that should be followed up with what do you think? 00:48:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, was there a note on the website at all? 00:48:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, details right here, July 24th was the last thing. 00:48:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, so this one has to be touched. 00:48:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So here's what I would recommend for you just to, again, so we're just trying to figure out what helps you get things done the quickest without being tedious. Now, the amount of volume that you have, maybe you spread it out across a couple of days, but this wouldn't take very long, especially if you did this every week and just literally went in, clicked on all of them real quick, because what would happen is if you started doing that and you started following up with your team, they should be doing this. They should be checking on their stuff and you go look at it and go, yeah, they're on it. And then you just start to do it as just kind of randomly going through the cases as a audit and just be like, hey, is there anything that has gone too long without being touched? And if so, who did it? Why are we unclear about what the expectations are? just think that we shouldn't, but is there a disagreement internally about whether we should or we shouldn't? is there not enough clarity about what requires a response? Is it that some people just feel like they're bothering clients? And, and, and does that need to be trained because like, who's bothered by getting the job done for them that we're supposed to do, getting it wrapped up posted up that type of thing. 00:50:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) be something that you'd be willing to do is just just go like once a week, just once a week. And you can split it across two days if it just is annoying, but honestly, that should go really quick. I think, I think you could be done with all your cases in an hour. Just click, get out. Because most of them, you're going to see, yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. Yep, they touched it. There should only be a few where you're like, that's a long period, or you know that you looked at that last week. And you know that they're not at a time period that, because you already looked at it, right, that we should be messaging out. It's going to be a few more weeks. So after the first couple of times, it shouldn't take you very long. Yeah. But the insight into the gaps should be really quick and really clear. Would you do that? 00:51:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I mean, my file reviews are basically that. 00:51:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay. 00:51:06 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) So, once you've clicked our older cases, I should focus on those. But typically, on the new ones, I'll just check like the intro call was done. We've found insurance to take set liability. Basically, get the case, like the green light to start treating it. Middle ones are more, you know, where are they at? Are they going? going? Do they fall off? Are they missing? And then the really old ones is typically settled or we're just like waiting on health insurance, lean type of things. yeah, mean, I pretty much do what you just asked. But yeah, this case needs to be touched for sure. 00:51:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So, what is your schedule for doing that and making sure you've covered that? 00:52:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) all the cases, like what's the frequency? I try to do it at least every other day. 00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) All the cases? 00:52:10 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Not all of them, but like we'll go through a portion of my case list. The other week we've got like a bunch of new files. like, you know, I went ahead and went through all those, make sure like what first of all see what the case is. Is it like a big case, small case? What potential issues we might have with it? Where to send a client for treatment? 00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So would you just be willing then, let's say this is a starter, top to bottom, I'm looking at the way that we just looked at it. then also, and because we're running out of time, I don't know there's enough for you to tell me all of this, but like I'd like to understand all the things that you look at when you do file review. Now, we did talk about, would you be willing to do file review with your team yesterday? You did. And how many files did you go through? 00:53:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) We just felt like we did like 40 minutes. I think we went through like 10 cases. 00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so that's a long process. So my version of this audit is definitely not as thorough as what I think that you were doing. But there were two cases that probably should have been touched that we found in the first few. And like you said, they were older. So what I would like is just once just go through everything top to bottom. And then next week when we're all meeting, of give me some insight as to what you discovered and realize, okay, we should be doing it this way. And maybe it's by the age of the case. Maybe it's by a status or something like that, but. How can we just make sure that we're not going too long without touching the case and making contact with the client? And yeah, it's just about making sure because there are so many moving pieces, so many cases, so many different things to do, so many different reasons, it's not a fluid process, right? Because there's so much waiting on insurance, on doctors, on the patient, the client. So it could be really easy to have for things to fall through the gaps. So having a very specific process that makes sure that the only way to not have things fall through the cracks is top to bottom. could do that broken up as long as you're sorting the cases by date, right, by the day that they open, not because until they're closed. And so let's say you starting with the most recent cases up to like the most recent 50 cases, and then the next one, the next day, the next review, whatever, within that week, two weeks max, you're getting to the next 50. But then, so what I also think is two types of fire review. is just the quick glance, did it get touched, which you could go through all those 116 cases, probably in an hour. And you wouldn't have to go through all of them every week because they're, you know, they'd be really quick. So there's that version of it, and then there's the thorough, are there opportunities for us to like, do we need to do something different? But what I think will happen preemptively, is that as you go through in your skin, you'll go, you know what, we don't need to review that as a team, I saw enough of it, it's good. So then you can mark the cases that you probably should review as a team, have some questions about or somebody else you saw, there was a question that somebody on your team had, and then save those for the team power reviews because there's potentially something to discuss, whereas if everything looks good, you can just be like, you know what, nothing to discuss there, so you don't need to waste the team's time with basically managerial kind of oversight effort, which would be better with you for the most part anyway. So how do you think, how do you feel about that? 00:56:42 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah, I think that's the best way to do it because naturally we all go through our cases just to see what's, you know, available to be settled or, you know, these cases are my responsibility at the end of the days, so I need to know, you know, where they're at. and make sure that they get maximized. no, I think you'd write, it's the best way just to go through each one. 00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, so let's give that a try. I would love by the time that we meet next Tuesday that you had a chance to just go through everything and look at that and just kind of note anything. One thing I would love to note is how many cases had not been touched in more than 30 days. Do you remember that? Yeah. Okay. And just anything else that might have stood out and let's do the longest. Like, so whatever you notice, like, so there's one that hasn't been touched for three months. If you see anything longer than that, like, I want to know what's the longest that they had reached out just to check and make sure. and then here's our next step, just kind of restating the expectations of how the case will proceed. Does that make sense? Just people are people, know, and especially if they're going through hard things, there's a huge difference for really it's just a little amount of effort. It could just be the text message, right? And you could even have fairly canned text messages that are but let me fix this before putting in the number and or I guess if you're using the automations, it's already there so just be careful. But just it's that feeling of we are aware of you and we're at and we're checking in on you. It's a human nature nurture. 00:59:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) no, I get it. I mean, we don't really think about it because, you know, we see the cases every day but it's a business perspective for you, but nearby. 01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like something traumatic and bad happened to me and all of this sucks and somebody called to check on me and it made my day, you know? 01:00:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Yeah. 01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It could do a lot for us and it can also increase referrals possibly if we just really made somebody feel good. It's a little thing. It could have a big impact over time and a compounding effect too as we gained that reputation for just really kind of holding, it's not hand holding, it's 30 days, but compared to just waiting through things, you know, make them not feel like it's a number and a transaction, that type of thing. Okay. Well, we were able to have that whole conversation because you did all of this, so great job. 01:00:48 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I'm here to see Lorenz have stuff that I didn't know on there. 01:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, so we're all meeting next week and we will take a look at it and I think that that is going to be useful too. I'm really glad that you guys want to do that. the the working together thing because I think it's going to be insightful and even if it's just like a five percent difference um but if you give him five percent of your good stuff and he gives you five percent of his good stuff you know none you're both you're both just getting better and and then we're all getting better insight into the whole thing it's good you know that's not good you got to fix that i know that's what navies are for i can't take it out though because i have conversations every day or no no i can't because i just lift super heavy until i can't and then i can't walk for a few days but my strength increases i lose weight i still have more energy my like i did some studying and it's crazy like it's like kind of a new hack. I don't have to exhaust myself. So yes, I I could do better. My last lake press was 390 though, and it was smooth like butter. So I was pretty happy with that, okay? 01:02:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) Okay. I'll be able to work out every day. You won't stay up late because you'll hate yourself afterwards. 01:02:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I know, but I'll be so tired all the time. I ain't trying to be like that. And I just no. Naps are cool. Did you know I'm gonna leave you with this? It's like 80 reduction in cardiovascular events for people, especially men who take naps three or more times a week of at least 20 minutes. Massive benefit. 01:02:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) I don't know I'm a weekend for sure. 01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Okay, you gotta get, you gotta get one in the middle of the week, just a little 20 minute. Maybe not. You're still young, but you're not up there like grandma here. All right, it was great talking to you. 01:03:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com) What time is it? 01:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) two. Yeah, oh, we're over.

Bye. patrick@sweetlaw.comPatrick
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You Thank you. Hi, how are you? 00:04:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How are you? 00:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Sleepy. I'm not fully awake yet. didn't eat yet. daughter took my, well, older daughter took my younger daughters to seminary. So got to sleep in a little bit, but I was up till two working. So. No, it's just the way my body works better like that. Yeah, but also I have a missionary training at nine o'clock. So, are we going to have to check? Sure. think I do. I do. So, anyway, what were we talking about yesterday? 00:05:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We were talking about mama bear marketing, um, talking about the, um, the Google Doc we have on there in the community and how to build the offers and all that stuff. then your boxers, just listened to and yeah, so I did have a fun night last night. Thank you. And, um, and then this morning, I actually was at my mom's for bit and then, but you know, I feel a little off-kilter and then after this call after I picked my dog up because I didn't do my Bible journaling or anything this morning because I just got off and went straight to artwork and then helping my mom. Um, but uh, yeah, so in the chat chat stuff, yeah, that's cool too. I remember Ravi doing that when I used to work for him a couple years ago. So, and yeah, that was cool. I think me and Karina were going to launch a AI thing for e-com for Shopify stuff. I know we were building a little bit of about two, but we never really launched it per se, except everyone still goes to the free version. But I get what you mean, like what would Maria say? Like, that is, it is powerful. 00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Um, Yeah. Um, I was trying to figure out if I could figure out who I'm bear marketing was. Cause I remember there's this lady that's been around a long time also. 00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And her name is Barb Ling. Oh, Barb Ling. Yeah. 00:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) She goes by mama bear now. 00:06:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, oh, I thought she used to be just barbelling marketing or something. 00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. might be, but she on Facebook now, she's mama bear B. Oh. 00:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, I'm a barbelling authority marketing coach. Yeah, she bought some stuff for me in the back of the day. And then she also, it was in the worry form of doing good offers. Like she's just a decent person, you know? that offers. 00:07:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I'm on her page and she doesn't say mama bear on her website but she just shows coffee. That's why I remember her. She's really in the coffee. That's right. 00:07:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) yeah, she says on apology baby blue word 23 plus year veteran marketer coffee appreciator moose wrangler and more virtual coach. yeah, she doesn't have mama bear anywhere here but you're right. Maybe she just recently really branded. 00:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, no, this is um, if you go to facebook.com slash mama bear entrepreneur. That's her. 00:07:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah, I would. 00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, and I think that that's That's her old profile that she switched over. 00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, Fred's. Oh, she can't use that because that's a personal page, not a business page. 00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. And I can't switch mine to a professional page, not, not business, but professional. It's not an option for me, which is weird. 00:08:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Anyway, yeah. Yeah, I'm just shocked to see that it's not a page page. Did they take that functionality away? Because it used to be pretty easy that you could switch it over to a professional page. 00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I don't know when I have more than 500 followers and half for a long time. 00:08:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So I don't know why I wouldn't be able to. But I mean, it's been years since I've had a client do that. But yeah, I'm going to try to get maybe there was a glitch. I always think something's not working that should work on Facebook. Then it's a glitch and go back next day and try. 00:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, any of it, I've been looking at it for months because. they have analytics now. 00:09:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) And it's not a business page, it's a newer thing. It's not, it's gone. 00:09:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Anyway, um, so I want to be paying attention to the time with my brain. I did want to share with you though, one thing that Dan sent me, I'll just put it in the notes. Um, it's okay, I bought it, and I would share it with you if you wanted it, but um, hold on a second, gonna find chat here. Really inexpensive, and I think the only thing I'd probably use it for would be maybe some quick um, graphic type creation. I haven't gone through everything yet. their sales page, showed that they have some automations for graphics, but a lot of variety. And they do have AI. I'm playing with it to see. I don't like to finish products. don't think it's quality enough to be representative me, but I do think this type of stuff is sometimes good for repurposing old things. And one of the tests that I wanted to run was kind of a side-by-side faceless type of campaign to see what can be done because there's a lot of faceless marketing. People don't care about knowing, liking, and trusting if it's not a huge investment. They care about, are you teaching me something useful? And I got, I don't know if I still have it, businessprofessor.ai, where I would basically repurpose the same content and just change the voice a little bit to not necessarily be about the mom's side and the personal details as much, but still the same. The value of the content. tactics, principles, things like that, because the duplication shouldn't be that difficult if I get low cost, you know, assistant. And then if I'm duplicating it, but under a different brand sufficiently, it shouldn't be anything that's penalized and it would be like diversifying, basically. But it's an experiment I want to run because the audiences are so much bigger than they were, even just a few years ago, even pre-COVID. And it keeps growing this world of, you know, people wanting to side hustle, things like that. was thinking about, you know, even when I was a kid, my mom did, Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, what else did she do? But there was, women were selling things. And then there was, you know, the candles and the melaleuca and the amway and all that type of stuff. So, but now they've got the internet. I just think that it's, and the statistics are there, but there's just so many people to get to who aren't internet marketers per se, who are maybe they sell at the farmers market on the weekend. they could be taught about profit margins and simple things like that. So anyway, kind of thinking about how to expand stuff. Instead of, I always feel like I get trapped in the high ticket world and high value and high level. I, there's only, like I said, there's only so much of that you can do anyway, because high level clients require high level performance and investment. And so, you know, there's only a few of that. Everything else needs to be leveraged. And I just realized, like, there's a lot of people who know almost nothing and just to be able to teach them. So, anyway, those thoughts. But, and then, okay, so we were talking about potentially starting something with both of us as a kind of like a baseline foundation and being able to. And I mean, even at the same time, parallel, while we're not working together, kind of duplicate some of that work. Like, we could create a school group or a high level community that's similar and just start piping people in and figuring out a very low level schedule like where once a week we show up and answer questions. And, but because high level has rocking, like, let's say you make a reference from your existing group that you're building into this group, that link would be a tracking link. So those people are tracked from day one. So if those people buy anything, no matter what they buy, you get the higher level commission. And because like I have Facebook followers, that would just come in and do things. And we can decide if we want to create it as a free group or, you know, maybe it's $20 a month and it's low cost. And we're going to show up and talk to each other anyway. But how scalable is that? How many people would want to come in? I'm thinking volume of people who have trusted enough to give a credit card for $20 and to make a commitment for $20 a month. I think that could add up pretty quickly. But then, as we're talking to them every week, figure out, okay, what are you guys interested, what are you responding to? Where does the conversation not where does it consistently go? 00:15:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Let's offer that. 00:15:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let's make a training. Okay, this training is going to be $200 and this is what we're going to do. And we don't even have to like we can go run ads separately to bring people into that training. But if we have a group full of people who have already paid $20 a month and half of them have said, I really need to know this. And you and I know it doesn't matter what they want to know, we're going to be able to teach it quickly, live probably. And then provide some really good resources which we can take to VAs. I've got a ton of them of different sorts, video graphics, PDFs, all the works where we can take the live content that we made and then go make some pretty visual supports for them. And then that becomes an evergreen product that already exists in the members area. like, hey, you have this problem. Here's all our testimonials, these people. we give this to them and and you can have it now and it does not have to be a live training and if then you know if something goes really well we can say we'll do the live training again in a few months whatever if people want live more because they can do Q&A then we charge more that's the thing but there's so many different topics we could just do that on repeat but then so the Maria Tina version is always going to be a little different than just Maria riffing all by herself and just Tina riffing all by herself but especially if we really kind of like if it's a marketing question I'm glad Maria go at it and I'll have a little bit pieces and if it's a business management operations kind of stuff then I'll go at it and you contribute when you have a little something to say you might have a lot to say but if we agree that we're going to kind of let the other one shine in a particular area but give the other space and go So, yeah, I actually have really something good to contribute I want to share so that we get a well-rounded thing, know, so we're not competing, but we are kind of compartmentalizing so that we can establish separate brands under one roof for our personal benefits while still serving the community really well. I think that that could work and just flow, especially because I'm not going to get offended that if you've got some great ideas, I'm going like, that's awesome, and I can have eyes. 00:17:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's, there's something there, yeah, I can't get my full hand around it of all the tracking, know, because I also don't want to fall down from it, you know. 00:17:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It won't be hard, and we could ask Dan for it, but it won't be hard. It's really, all it is, is anybody that comes into us has to to be tracked once because the source tracking so they're either coming in from an ad that we did which we would be tracking where they're coming in from one of our personal links and we just need to make sure if we want credit for it right that each of those links are trackable so if you're you would just have one group or you could have multiple links and I would show you how to do it so that you know it and I could even set them up for you if you don't even want to touch it and just be like Maria this is it and we'll go do a test test like source right and make sure that they're tagged as came from Maria we'll just put Maria something like that right and then show you so then if that person makes a purchase we'll have to figure out how to how to do their reporting and the commission structure but for sure Dan would help with that and if he didn't do it for free I'd hire somebody to do it but high level does that really easily okay yeah that's one of the great benefits of it And if the community is in high level and the sales are in high level, it's all there. Yeah. So, yeah, it would actually be really not quite as simple as doing it without the tracking, but the tracking is not going to be difficult. 00:19:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Well, that's cool. That's cool. So, and just on another note, when you brought up Designer, I shared screen real quick. 00:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've been using it since 2016. 00:19:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, yeah. 00:19:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Let me share screen right now. 00:19:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, I don't, haven't used AI, AI, AI part. See that 2016, I created the e-commerce email promotions, like it's a product I used to sell, don't know, for like seven bucks, low ticket offer. that's really big. something's worth about it. Anyway, but yeah. and actually just the recent YouTube video that did really well, I made the product here, the 100 digital offers. So I made it obviously in chat should be T first and some of my own input. And then I used the template and just like put in my own graphic here of the screenshot. And then it's just super, super simple. 00:20:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's not as pretty as camera. 00:20:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) but it did the job and I needed done like in about 10 minutes before I put it in the community. See, I bought, I haven't pinpointed it yet. Where is marketing master account? need to re send it to my school community. But anyway, so yeah, that's cool. 00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I've done that. I want to share something with you too so you can see I need to feed it more data to this library. 00:20:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) But what does Dan think? what we should be offering and all that stuff? he have any ideas input? Because sometimes I'm going to be honest, sometimes I get too confused. you know, when I start thinking about all the things, and maybe just because I'm not centered, because I haven't done my bible stuff here. 00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Meditations are journaling this morning. I didn't ask him, but we could if you want to do, I think he is a massive Maria fan and Tina fan. So ask, ask, um, pretend you're a person that has a business question, fairly simple, um, about business operations or principles or strategies or even problem solving. Let's see how this AI does. 00:21:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Oh, um, how do I get traffic from YouTube marketing? 00:21:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I haven't, it will be my kind of content, like, um, just, just not marketing specific, like, um, what should I pay my stuff? hiring people, how should I choose what to work on? um, yeah, pretty much anything that's not marketing strategy specific. 00:22:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) How could I get more productive in my business, family? 00:22:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I told you not to say, ah, would never say that. 00:22:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Look at that. It affects hourly rate now for the game changer. yeah. 00:23:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Now, go make that magic. 00:23:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) You got this. 00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I mean, if for just being able to ask a question that that would give if somebody had never experienced that. Yeah, that we get them started. Anyway, so I haven't vetted all of my content yet, because you can only give it 10 files. So what I have to do, and I'm going to hire a VA to do this, is combine multiple transcripts into a single file, because it's not really, I don't know what the limit to the eyes of the files is, but I haven't anywhere near approached that. Okay, so just putting it into single files. And then I've also included the transcripts of testimonials from clients. Really long ones on YouTube that give details as to like what I can do for them. So anyway, yeah, just this. So I want to use this to when it's trained properly create short pieces of content for me based off of things I've already created and done. So if I want to pick a topic in any, I don't necessarily want to just use it as it comes out. For sure, I would edit some of these things all the time the struggle. No, that's no. Tell me your AI without telling me your AI that. But and take something, put some bones on it and go like, Oh, yeah, okay, well, tweet this, tweet this, even ask it a question because it's asking it from my library of vast library of information once I get all my calls in there and then be able to repurpose it according to okay well this is a Twitter post I wanted to and I know you can do threads on Twitter but if I wanted to make it shorter and make it like one line each so I can break it up into Instagram quotes and then go send it to a VA who plugs it into some images from you know really quickly there's like four and five dollar an hour VA is still that are good at Canva and I don't know if they're as fast as maybe eight or ten dollar VA's so that's an experiment I'm going to be playing with and I usually hire a couple people and just kind of try them against each other see what ends up being most profitable just because people are cheaper for our doesn't mean that they're cheaper for our. got it, got it. Yeah. So anyway, but yeah, um, what, what would help you get some clarity on the opportunity of what it would look like to do work together. Um, so that's, well, so that it's clear and then you can decide, do you want to put any mental energy into it or not. 00:26:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Um, I think, I think just like, so we got the free community, right? 00:26:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It can be free. It can be paid. It can be paid from, from the beginning, just low cost, like really low cost, but so that we know that we've got people who want to be there enough with their money, who have enough trust to pass over a credit card. 00:26:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay, so it's almost like, uh, I kind of do this when I. Great offers for people who share screen. know you got to go like a little minutes. Share screen. It'd be sort of is one that I've done with us for I'm possible. So basically like customer journey map like like like these are different. So like you know step one was micro offer magic you know then or about social group and five so step one could be like a community five bucks month. Maybe we make it like one buck a month or five bucks a month or whatever ten bucks a month and then what in their customer journey what is it like what step to what's that offer there and like what are we thinking right like what so we can kind of yeah so so like and if I go I don't know who else I've done a few of these four. or community. 00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So I have a quick idea for that the first variation. think the first version is you come into the community and we both have free pieces of content that they can consume so that they can get familiar with us and just kind of have a place and we encourage just talking. So it's basically another version of an email list, kind of. We can communicate with them. But it's in a place where so high level has an app, I think. And it's like lead something, whatever. But it's mobile and they have magic links so that people can open some things right from their email and go straight to the paid member area. And I'm OK with using school and paying for that too, if they need me. for sure, we'd want to charge like $5 a month or something. The first level is, we're going to put in lots of our content, pre-existing content, and you have access to it, and then the second level could be also not very much, and it could be either, like for me, could be they get the profit time, energy maximizer, and maybe one of your products, that is a paid product, but low cost. In addition, we'll have weekly meetings and you can show up to it, and so we maybe put the recordings in the free group, but they don't get to ask questions unless they're in the paid group, or in the like the five dollar month group, they get recordings, and let's say $20 or $40 a month group, you can come in and ask questions and we will answer your questions. So, the lower level group is you get our content, not our time. The next level up is you get our content and our time. And the next level up could be something much more high level once we figure out and we start talking to people. 00:30:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Good. 00:30:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) else are you going to go get 20 year veterans in business, women, know, that have been online veterans. It's not very, it's not easy to find. 00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) No, I know I'm going to have an analyze them and I probably should join their community. 00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) If I go to school discovery. 00:30:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) There's one woman that. I imagine in this grandma is making a lot and has all these people in that community. It's really right at the top of your digital growth community. It's number one for engagement and yeah, she's got. You know, you you you know, to build a daily pay customer base digitally. 00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 39,000 members and what's the cost? 00:31:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) This one might be her free group, let's see, proven six-figure. 00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) says paid. 00:31:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Where? Right there. yeah, but here, because there's joint group, okay. So, yeah, what email did you use to purchase? Okay, so she's then selling it via sales page, okay. Only how people to pay the joint here, live weekly mentoring support, giving monthly networking events, zero of six-figure online is six months. That's her promise. She looks really good, actually. That's fine, I don't know her name is. Payment methods. Are you saying that? 00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) what's right there. 00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Are you early, 423? And she's new system IO, isn't it, she's system Ha ha. That's her name. And she has any love us? 00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) How many do you have math real quick? 39, what was the note was 47? Yeah, so 39,000 times 47. That's 829,000 a month. 00:32:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Holy crap. 00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And it's more than that because it's almost 40,000. 00:32:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So road map to attract daily pay customers digitally, build an impactful email list, create a well-known brand and proven six figures in six months formula. 00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my thing about wanting to do this stuff together is that both you and I have gone to the point where, and because we can still, like I said, have our separate stuff and feed it so that you're not risking building everything around me. And vice versa, not that I'm even worried about it, but that's just this smart thing to do because anything can happen, right? But the roadblocks that both of us will have, we'll get to them so much faster. We'll doing something together. And I mean, I'm all about leverage. To me, it would be so leverage because we have different skill sets, but we have very similar skill sets too. And one of them is so few people just show up and work all the time. And I don't mean all the time. don't actually work all the time, but I show up every day. I move the needle every day. lot of people, most people honestly, really don't do that. I've worked with tons of people. There's a lot of inconsistency, even with high-level performers, because they burn themselves out. so it cycles a burnout. I don't get burnt out. I don't let burnout happen to me. Because I nap. A lot. I can nap three times a day. I will nap three times day if that's what it takes. You feel good. I take time off. I take little trips like so and I don't work long hours, but yeah, I do show up consistently. I pay for help. I pay for good help. I train good. Most people pay for help. And then they don't train well. And so it's not useful. I'm not getting any help. I dig in and I get to thorough training quickly. Screen sharing, video sharing, then so we're doing it together. I'm showing you and then you tell, you show me that you can do it. And then you go be released to do the work. And we have constant communication and feedback. So like, some people, most people abdicate. 00:34:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) I delegate. Yeah. 00:34:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) and they think that they're delegating, but they're abdicating anyway. And now your brain is always considering about marketing and offers. I hate starting there. also, you, yeah, I mean, you just love the part that I like. 00:35:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) to go about a lot. 00:35:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) And I think where you have friction is clarity and should it be this or this and also anchoring because if you're trying something every month and that's your habit that I know that it's just your tendency to kind of bounce around. So what you would need support with is how does your spirit get the freedom to explore? Because obviously that's important to you. Without that sabotaging what you're already doing by distracting you too much. You get to play and get that outlet but you've got somebody helping you go okay. Now that you've played you have to make a decision. Do you keep playing there or can you bring something back to here because this is what you chose first or are you switching and if you're switching be real clear about why you're switching and make sure that it's aligning with your values because Sometimes we need permission to switch, and we give ourselves permission, right? Sometimes that's the thing to do too, but that logical conversation, I can have in my sleep. Yeah. You get really clear and really confident and peaceful, because that's the part that slows things down is trying to figure it out, you know, do what I want to do and don't I want to do it. And the usually it's a why, but sometimes that why is not very clear. And so the probing questions that have you get to that why, that's what I'm really gonna add. 00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Okay. Okay. I love based on what we just saw. I think we just have one community that's a little ticket, maybe start at $5 and bring it up to $47 and be like that girl. Like I think we just saw maybe a path. 00:36:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. 00:36:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) Sorry. Between the two of us like there's like, yeah, like people get so much value out of it. 00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's what I was thinking something about too is just starting. really level and bringing it up and be like, okay, the price is increasing, the price is increasing until we get to kind of a place where the conversions drop and we keep increasing it. That way we can get numbers in because there's nothing like an empty group trying to talk to an empty group. And then we learn as we grow, but I think that that's the rocket fuel is getting the people to come in and tell us how we can serve them that were already attracted to us for whatever reason at a low level cost. And then we serve them really well and we can let them be grandfathered in or say, you get this price for this next year, but for this year, you know, but next year we're raising prices because in place and whatever, nobody, yeah, groceries don't get it locked in, rent rarely doesn't like occasionally, but most things in class. Yeah. got it. So I think the next steps would be to to kind of create like a very simple map like that, right? what the offer is and what the content would be. So like, I think if I have that profit time, energy maximizer to serve to the community, I feel like you think number one, I feel like I've brought a valuable contribution that earns whatever my low level portion of it is, right? And I'll keep bringing it. You bring something of yours. And but that's impactful that you know that they're going to go. Something is going to be they'll have an aha moment or something tactical that they can implement right away, but not your best stuff, right? And then we just put together an offer put together some graphics and images and start piping people in for $5 the first time for like, and Honestly, we'll see that the issue with school is that there's a few issues. First of all, people can very easily see how much you're making and how much money you have because of how many people are in your group and what your paid price is. Yeah, that's just one thing. Competitors, whatever. There's that. School does pipe people in, but you can only charge one price a month per group. So if you raise the price, you can't let one group. If you charge it through school, so what she did was she charged off-site and let them in for free or however it worked out, but because school only lets you charge one price per person. So if you say it's $5 for you guys, but it's $35 for you guys, you can't do that. 00:39:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) School, I'll let you do that. 00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So anyway... We would just have to figure out the tactical approach around that and she does it, which is charging the money off of school and then letting them into it. 00:40:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis) So, yeah, stuff to think about, yeah, all right, we'll have fun. Okay, you're going to your, your study? 00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I'm late, it's a missionary training, but they record it so I can still get it. maria@mariagudelis.comTina MarieMaria & Tina🪄
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Hello, how are you? 00:00:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Cleaners day and up on the poetry of my various furry friends. 00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I like it. 00:00:21 - Dan Ryan (3) Doing calls, doing meetings, look out. 00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's good, it's good. I got a full night's sleep and groceries just got delivered. My older daughter took my younger daughter to seminary and she's making dinner tonight. And there's a flipping spider on my ceiling. Hopefully I must go with this. A comment? I don't want to get it. I don't like spiders. But I am the only spider killer. I guess you get to live for a while. I don't feel like dealing with it. 00:00:59 - Dan Ryan (3) I don't want to live. 00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's, it's no spiders. Anyway, what, uh, was it a work call you had just now? 00:01:12 - Dan Ryan (3) Two, then I, uh, talked to developers at, uh, SOD at nine, and then I just had a meeting with Circle, because I was like, you know what, I'm going to look at these other community platforms, and I'm officially sold on Circle, Tina. It is. 00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Really? Yeah. Taylor, well, to agree with you. 00:01:35 - Dan Ryan (3) Uh, okay. Uh, probably not for the reasons. I'm sure Taylor really didn't evaluate it and just copy Brandon Burshaw or something. Uh, I'm like talking to the guy like, okay, what if I want to send a, you know, I didn't, I was like, I have a CRM and what if I want to send people over from my CRM? So they're going to opt in. through this lead thing, and that's where I'm going to send them emails, and that's where I'm going to make offers and pitch ship and, right, because they don't really have massive email or whatever. mean, yeah, I don't think they even have it. And I go, and then I want to get them over and I want to tag them with the three things that I'm collecting in the form. He's like, yep, API, don't use apps. I go, okay, great, that could be that. And then I was like, all right, let's say I want to have a free level, and then I want to have different paid tiers. So let's have paid tier one is like a group coaching thing, or whatever, or, or it's one on one coaching, or let's say I want to do a cohort. So there's like a six week cohort. He's like, let me show you, opens up all these sites. He's like, you can do everything you just said. was like, God damn, really? It's like, okay, how do I generate the payment? it's like the payments here. You can make it. a month to month. So you can make it a full page, you can make it a month to month. You've got a link at the end. Okay, so I have that link. So if I'm on a sales call, for example, I can downsell to the page, that payment plan is ID up, and you just send in this link, I know it's in the link through the fee around, I go, okay, what if I want to, what if I want to take, I got this is further down the I go, if I want to take activity from, from circle and update my record in my CRM. So using mom as an example, I met with him and I talked about Ninja and mom. Not so much because I thought I would use it for Ninja, but he literally, the reason I said Brendan Bouchard is because he showed me Brendan's thing. So what they're releasing right now is a headless API, that you can take circle components and put it inside. Buddy balls, basically. So when he opened up Brendan's side, And was like, that's body boss. And he's like, it is? And he's yep. But he's like, well, that's what Brent. And he's like, I don't know who he's doing it for him. But he's like, they're doing it. So see, they had circles just iframed inside body boss, which looked good, as a matter of fact. And but now you can take components, like the feed component, and then have that in there. And your users are in body boss, but you're using circle. And I was like, he's like, so you don't have to pay millions of dollars to develop these widgets, because you can use ours. I'm like, oh, that's dope. I didn't know you could do that. He's like, it's not out. It's coming out like two weeks. He's like, you're just showing me because it sounds like you would get it. I definitely get it. So then Brendan's got someone doing it for him. 00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) like, I'm pretty sure I can find out who did that. 00:04:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And then go talk to them. So yeah, I'm like, man, this is high levels. They're never going to catch up. of this. Schools never going to catch up to this. Like, these guys are way, way further ahead. 00:05:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, but I went and just got that snapshot yesterday. 00:05:09 - Dan Ryan (3) That's okay, because I do still think like you could do the sales calls. 00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Wait, you got what's natural? Community one that you showed me. 00:05:18 - Dan Ryan (3) I think that can work. I do think that can work still, but for mom, because mom to me is going to be extremely complicated. So it's going to have, it's going to have all the things that I just said. You want a free tier, then you want a paid tier, then you want a government tier, then you want a dedicated error for fan flow users, then you want a dedicated area for people that are in. But we're, I don't know if this is going to be the name, but we have this continuous release strategy. So it'd be like, hey, no, you're going to pay to be in the continuous release strategy cohort. One, which starts in January, two starts in February 3 starts in March, and in that group, you are releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks with whoever's in that 20-person cohort, whatever. So those would all need to be separate paid tiers and separate private groups. And I'm like, yeah, so at that level, I love them, right? I don't know. have no idea. 00:06:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think you leave it out with the communities, because if you can't do that, then that would be a deal breaker for me too, because I want multiple tiers. And one thing that Circle can do that I don't know if you came across it, but it gives you stats of who's logged in and what information they've consumed. 00:06:48 - Dan Ryan (3) Yeah, you have to actually build some of that, he showed me that. Yeah. Interesting. The other thing that they have that is perfect for mom is spotify interest. I was like, oh, that's dope, and then they do mp3s, which we need, which high level doesn't support. So I was like, okay, but it's also like, you could do this headless thing and put it inside of high level. I was like, oh, that would be interesting. So you can still use high level and then just have circle inside of high level and he showed me another version of that. And it was just like the E card and he was saying, yeah, if you owe off, he kind of lost me. It was not super off on oh off, but he's like, imagine you just owe off your high level log in that you give them. It's the exact same log in for circles and they log in high level, they log in circle, they just don't know. It's like, yeah, that would be great. So yeah, but I'm not totally sold, but I was like, oh. of this headless API is super interesting. 00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) What is a headless API? 00:08:08 - Dan Ryan (3) I mean, it's like you're not you're not using the wrapper, right? So you're not using the container of it of circle. So you're using the compound, you're getting access to the components. You can do with WordPress too. So it's like, it's super lightweight. There's not a lot of other code. It's just a thing. It's fairly new. I hadn't really ever heard. I'd heard of it for WordPress. I had not heard of it for like one of these standalone softwares that was surprisingly said that I was like, oh, okay. I did not see that coming. 00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Interesting. Maybe. Oh, 00:09:00 - Dan Ryan (3) But I'm looking at it more for, because we've been talking to these dudes grooved for the bands. So then I was like, I don't like those guys. And there's no way they're going to catch up to any of these people's school. You know, whether it's school or circle or it might be networks. But these guys are starting out and they're not even called Pepsi Sprite. They're nothing. They're like Fanta. They're never going to. But they're trying to target just musicians. that's sort of the value problem. But tech wise, they're texting. 00:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Who's texting? 00:09:45 - Dan Ryan (3) They're called groups. 00:09:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I was like, wait, what is the group? 00:09:53 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, never run. Yeah, but it's the, it's those, I mean, props. It's those TikTok influencers. They're like, they got so much reach on TikTok. now they're like, oh, we do communities for all audiences. And they've gotten some of the biggest TikTokers to be on the platform. And they're, they're using that to attract other people. But the problem is the software itself stinks because it's a bunch of TikTokers developing software. Like, yeah, it's not good. It's not going to go well long term. 00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I think the, um, man, it's always so complex. There's so many things that have to be measured. So like the speed of implementation. So school is super fast to implement. That's really, to me, the only draw about it. There's a lot of drawbacks, including analytics, you have to pay for every community, um, they don't integrate, the communities don't integrate with each other really well, where you could do that with like circle. I think Circle is pretty quick to integrate, but also has a lot of complex features that you could do and it doesn't have a native app, but it does have an app. So that's good. You don't know if it has a magic link, which I think is really good for people that don't want to use the app and just want to be able to go straight to their content without having to log in and remember a password because a lot of people don't use password managers and they don't have an efficient login process. Yeah. But what I'm looking at in this high level community is it is convoluted. That was my issue with high level to begin with is that it's convoluted. It's there's. It's not pointing click. You know what I mean? It's not intuitive. And then same with Buddy Boss was the same thing. 00:11:51 - Dan Ryan (3) So yeah, Buddy Boss is not intuitive at all. 00:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) no, you've got to have somebody who knows exactly what they're doing. And that is. 00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Not super easy to come by thing Yeah, what you need is like well, I mean, I think you got right the snapshot for high level is gonna have Hey do this or it's gonna build a bunching for you You would need something like that force you would need something like that for circle too But there's no snapshots right it's gonna be Build and you'd need someone that like he took me in a community that was clearly a coach and then doing individual coaching so like You would have like a damn thing so when I log into circle as like Let's say I'm like so I'm your high ticket level right so it's like you log in I'm high ticket I get access to everything like the courses or all the logs for me, but then I also have a dedicated damn coaching in the area they call it a coaching, but it's not literally the coaching area. And then inside that you could have Dan, Mark, blah, blah, blah, but Mark can't see Dan and Dan can't see Mark. So all I see under coaching is Dan. And then it's a dedicated stream of Dan and Tina. I was like that's interesting not be group. 00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He goes, yeah. 00:13:25 - Dan Ryan (3) Okay, I didn't see I didn't see that coming. I can say in the video, I asked him to send me the recording. 00:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's all it's interesting. So what are your priorities for the membership for mom? 00:13:45 - Dan Ryan (3) So I've already proven I can generate a lead for under two dollars. And then they I think like 80% of them opted to join the Facebook group. But now I'm like, okay, I can just force and I can ask them if they want to join the community, if they assent, yes, and I can automatically go create the record in wherever I can do it in high level, I can do it in a circle. So then I go automatically create that record. So I'm not just putting in everyone, I'm putting in all the people that say yes, and then I'm tagging them as whatever, yes. And then the people that say no, I'm tagging them as no to invite them later. And then you would deliver potentially deliver the thing through the group and through email. So they're opting in, think I did two of the things I did, royalty release checklist and I did, no, I'm sorry, did a royalties checklist and then a release checklist. So they could get the thing in the group, or they could get the thing in the email either way. then ultimately they're for each, now we're going to Fletcher, if each thing is actually tied to a course, then you could sell them the course and deliver the course inside wherever, wherever that can be used. Then you have a free community that's just a bunch of people that are in the independent music space. And then I'm tagging them based on the first things that they tell me and then you'd enrich that, we let them enrich that through their profile, right? So the only thing I really ask them on the way in is what are you? And they're either a producer, engineer, an artist, a band, where those options are. So you would immediately be able to identify someone who's a band, come on up on that, possibly genre, and then you'd give them the ability to, hey, this is my Spotify thing. Because part of me has been mutilating, I forget who did this back in the day. I think it might have been Justin or somebody else. But... it was like in the community, they would go juice people's Facebook posts, right? just put up this ad, can you guys go like it? And then a bunch of people would just go like the ad and back at that time, that was an indicator to push the ad further for Facebook. So it was like the community was participating in juicing other things within the community. So my version of it is like, you earn credits. So you can, if you do it, you get a credit. And then you can then, once you have that credit, that credit can be spent when it's time to promote your song. It's like, okay, you have 10 credits, so you can now get 10 clicks. Something like that. So when someone released this song, it's Spotify. It's like, hey, my song's out, Ghost Treatment. That's the signal to Spotify. People are interacting, it's Ghost Treatment, whatever else, whatever the things are. So, or you don't do that. It's just that. community is supporting, right? I came and released this out, and one go go support it. 00:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah, um, I don't know. They're so whatever. So, the circle has like gamification features in there. I think you're what you were talking about that they do actually. 00:17:28 - Dan Ryan (3) But they have, they have a bad game and stuff, but it's not game. It's not game. It's your, you decide. So you can build an automation in the background that hands out badges and stuff. It's not, it's not like built in. It's your user. So you could be like, completed the cohort completed the course that he showed me that those are these options. Automations that you build. There's nothing made of. That's like, oh yeah, we automatically have this game of occasion component. Hmm. Yeah. 00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Well, but and I don't know all the different ways that you could do it, but the idea that you have where the community supports each other with those credits for like listening to songs, downloading songs, whatever. I don't know. But I don't know that I heard the answer for like, like, if you were going to rank, first of all, if you were going to list the features that you want and then rank them, but I guess it doesn't matter if you found a solution that does everything that you want, but in the search for things, if you hadn't found everything, I would be curious to know what were the things that you had been looking for. 00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (3) So, was it my list? 00:18:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) it was Marx. 00:19:00 - Dan Ryan (3) So, Mark was always shooting down this or the other so like the last thing he sent was oh MP3 and then not sport it was like do beyond having a dream and like yeah, we do That's kind of a deal breaker for a music community because everyone's dealing in mp3 or mp4 so there's no music no music in bed and and then Circle also just happen on Spotify. was like oh, that's even better But not or not because when you're when you're in the pre-production phase Imagine you're in a group that's producing it while I'm working on a producing a song to be released You can only have mp3s of that while you're saying okay. Here's the first mix. It's gonna be an mp3 It's not it's not publicly available. You could put it on SoundCloud, but you probably don't want to It did have a SoundCloud integration too, which I was like god damn really but So yeah, Mark, it was that and it was he doesn't like when you put a video in, he wanted like a full full video post, I love Facebook and school doesn't do that, high level doesn't do that. So that was more of like just a UI sort of thing. School doesn't do it and high level is copying school, so therefore they don't do it. Circle doesn't. Mighty networks did it. Then as far as like, then there was just having the different, the pride of any sort of paywall, right, so I don't know school has a paywall. So having the free thing and then a paywall. 00:20:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So yeah, I think I like this. It's one or the other. You can either have a free group or a paid group, but you cannot have two tiers. 00:21:00 - Dan Ryan (3) Oh, see, school, you can have like nine, you can have unlimited tears. You mean circle? Um, circle, yeah. Um, and then the main thing he doesn't like about high level is it's built around courses, as opposed to being courses is part of it. So it's not really community, it's courses plus community, and he wants community first, there might never be courses, right? So what if, especially if you're dealing with just a band, a band is never going to have a course ever. Right. So he's like, we tried to, he's actually building community and more on that, um, trying to see how it goes. But that was the main sticking point is that it's like, uh, he's like, no, that doesn't fit for a band. What is a band teaching someone? 00:21:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) It's like, no, you're right. 00:21:57 - Dan Ryan (3) But I was like, we could use this for mom. He could put our core like it totally fits for forces first teaching first community second, but the this scenario is completely flip-flop. It's community first forces second. like, okay, then it makes sense. I mean, I guess that's probably the best way to look at it is that. Yeah, it's it's it's need community forward, not forces forward. So I like I went through this dude. 00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I took him through like ninja explain what ninja was.-hmm. 00:22:37 - Dan Ryan (3) it was like the ninja falls apart with our MCQ product. He's like, yeah, no. like, you're you'd never be like, he's like, I'm not saying you can't you have developers probably could. But he's like, then that's when he showed me Brandon Bouchard's thing and I said, was like, that's buddy boss. I was like, oh, okay, that's kind of interesting. So we could head this. BPS circle into because I think buddy bosses community stuff stinks It's like oh This could be better And then we can do the stuff like you know, we log them into our MCQ software from within buddy boss They don't know that they left. 00:23:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) He's like, oh, never gonna be able to do that Yeah, For me and and and also why which I know you think is proactive avoidance, but for me, it's really it's it's tactical learning Because it's hard for me to comprehend the user experience without having the user experience and Trying to create a list of what are the features that matter most like I can think of some things for me The course is the most important thing but community is really important as well because Because if I can leverage the conversation of other people in the community to kind of create almost like a gravitational pull towards the content, because there's also other people there. but but then you don't even know until you've done it does that work or not, you know, yeah, and so it's all theoretical. And it's just, it's just thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts until you do it and experience it. And that's the biggest thing is that I, um, whatever, I think if the list of the main things are there, then whatever else trade offs that you make, like, we know nothing's going to be perfect. But as long as the main features that you need are there and they're solid, then, you know, you don't have to move. But if you do move. I don't know, it's a whole nother thing. It's so hard just trying to build on something. 00:25:07 - Dan Ryan (3) And also for you, you're like going top down. You might never get down, right? if you're currently at high ticket. 00:25:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Explain what you mean down. 00:25:17 - Dan Ryan (3) Right, so the opposite would be free low ticket, mid ticket, high ticket, right? And you're at high ticket. So community is really more for the free, right? 00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) That's where the community still is going Agreed. 00:25:31 - Dan Ryan (3) So if you had me and Mark and someone's in Quasimodo or whatever that guy's name is, like, if they were all... 00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Oh, wait, wait, who's Quasimodo? I don't know, but the doctor. Oh, Boogie. Boogie. 00:25:44 - Dan Ryan (3) So if like me and Mark, right? If you're trying clients, we're in a community. 00:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) We're not going to go in the community. 00:25:53 - Dan Ryan (3) No. No, I might go in there, I might go in there because there's something there for me, right? Right. You're like, hey, log in. I need you to log in and watch this video. Like we're going to talk about this next week. Yeah, I'm going to be in there for that. And so there, but there might be some discussion. I could see Mark, you know, Mark loves to talk, right? And me too, right? I might comment back to someone, right, in that context. we're not going to get in this back and forth discussion. 00:26:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) No, I wouldn't even have my high level clients would never be there. Because first of all, I'm not giving somebody access to all my people, right? And be like, hey, guess what? These are all the people for you to try to coach or something like that. I'm not really afraid of it. It's just kind of the thing that I have embedded in my mind because of the texture. But also, it's super high touch. Like why would I downgrade our interaction? 00:26:45 - Dan Ryan (3) Well, I'm not saying it's to downgrade. 00:26:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) So my point was that you have those people. 00:26:50 - Dan Ryan (3) And yeah, you could be like, hey, the stuff's here. And I would go do this thing, right? And then when you go down to the next level, and what is the next level? The next level is like course buyers. Even them, even them, whoever they are, it's not going to be super cheap, but it's still going to be whatever. And a lot of what your stuff teaches them is antithetical to wasting time in the community, right? It'd be like, you need to be in your business. So I don't see you ever going down to this tier where there's like, just community, right? Like, like, what's exactly what's going to happen to my mom? Mom's going to start. We're going to try and turn free people into customers. 00:27:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) You're not. No, I am. I am. And here's why, because it's more of a kind of give back type of thing. It's not about the logical approach to getting high level clients, although it does happen because I'm that person. And I've seen other people do it where they go buy the free thing, really high level people and just go like, oh, they know what they're talking about. But then they circumvent it. They don't go by the course or do anything else like that. They're like, hey, how do I hire you, that type of thing. But for me, it's the long term play, right? It's the ascension. It might take two, three, four, five years for somebody to get to, they become a high level client, but I've been teaching them the whole time. And it's also more of instead of having a blog where it's just one-sided and or instead of sending out emails, it's just a content home. It's a content medium source, and that, for me, is more about energy. It just feels like, right? It's not different. Email would work just as well. A blog could work just as well, Facebook just as well. It's just a preference of psychologically what it feels like to put it inside of something called a community. You know what I mean? Yeah. But then are you going to go like live once a week, teeny hours, like, so I'm not doing it by myself. I'm going to do this with Maria. 00:29:10 - Dan Ryan (3) She loves this. This is what I saw in one of groups like, so one of the groups that he showed me was for Alcatraz North, and I might have been with him, to be honest, and that I could see like, you know, their calendar or whatever, what I was going to get. Yeah. So I imagine they are doing that. They're saying, hey, get in on this on a time block freebie. And then, you know, then they're in the community and you go from there. 00:29:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) Yeah. Um, exactly that we, and I've been talking about it with her because, so she bounces all over the place. 00:29:47 - Dan Ryan (3) That's her biggest issue. 00:29:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com) I hardly noticed that about her. And my biggest issue is I don't want to be on video. I don't want to do all these things, but they're really good at drawing in people fast because you can connect. Now, I don't, it's not that I mind being on video so much, it's just, I don't want to talk to myself or talk to a camera. It's just so weird. And it's so, I'll have human conversations all day long. So I want to have somebody to talk to and do it with, and I want somebody else's brain that I can access frequently. And so, anyway, if we do it with, she needs all the conversation, wants to have all the conversations. And she does marketing, I do business operations, all the mental stuff. So it's a really good blend. And that's been a huge other part of reason why I haven't done this because I'm like, I don't want to do it by myself. I've never wanted to do it by myself. I do enjoy the community. do enjoy people. love teaching, answering questions. don't even mind having live conversat

Hello, can you hear me?
00:00:06 - Seth Ellsworth
What was that?
00:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me, but I'm sleepy.
00:00:12 - Seth Ellsworth
Sounds sleepy.
00:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, but my mission blessings set me apart when I got set apart said that I would have enough energy and do what I need to do. So I'm not canceling anything.
00:00:26 - Seth Ellsworth
We'll put that to the test.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm excited and I'm loving it.
00:00:42 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm excited It sounds like a really cool family history of the life changing thing.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is. And being able, I think, I thought that, I don't know, I do everything from my computer. at home. So I didn't think that it would feel very different, but it is definitely different. The interaction with the Holy Ghost is different. The level of accountability I have spiritually is different. The blessings are different. And I'm only just getting started and I expect that to increase as I practice and lean into it. I was literally just built for this, which is why the spirit I think was bugging me so bad about wanting to do this kind of mission. But the records, the technology, the speed of the evolution, and most of the missionaries are senior missionaries. So they're not super fast. don't have top of the line technology. They don't have their brains aren't really there. They're just like four, all the things that are happening, but they're willing. and that's all the Lord needs, right? He will make that happen. But I'm willing, ready, able, and amplified. And so it's, it's exciting. Anyway, I'm loving it. Yeah, but also we've had three wrecks in my family in three weeks and really horrible things happening to my children and like car wrecks? Car wrecks, yeah. My daughter got into two. One lady ran into me. I just watched her. was like, she's not really going to, yep, she is. And but nobody got her. It's been traumatic. I'm probably gonna lose my insurance. Like there's so many things going on. But the thing that I noticing is that resilience when it comes to just trusting in the Lord, that's everything. Like I understand how the children of Israel could have hated life and wanted to die. I if they couldn't be delivered, but then the Lord didn't deliver them, he just strengthened their backs and they were joyful. I'm like, I get that now. I get that now. Still in prison, still suffering, but finding joy and I totally get it.
00:03:18 - Seth Ellsworth
So that sounds like a really heavy.
00:03:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It doesn't feel heavy, though. see it. I know it should be.
00:03:30 - Seth Ellsworth
I know that it is, but it doesn't feel like it, which is what the materials so.
00:03:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and that's I think the blessing too is because while they're freaking out and crying and hurting, you know, like, I've got all my wearable tech, my ordering, my Apple Watch, like my sleep is not disturbed. My heart rate is even, my stress levels. Physically, there's no physical. to change and I just I'm like it is going to be okay all day long. I'm saying it's going to be okay. I don't have to stretch for that. I know it. And I can see that it has the calming effect because they've always fed off of my energy and I've definitely been a stress case in the past and but it's a good thing. The reason I'm serving the mission most of all besides being called is because I needed the extra blessings and protection but it's funny how simultaneously it comes with extra work and burden. Like it's a 12-hour week commitment. I don't even work that much. So for a year but I'm anyway so excited and so blessed and hopefully I can pass the blessings to others because I want Jesus to come back. Okay that's actually number one reason. If family history is the thing if Building, if being ready, having Zion ready, having done a certain level of tempo work, is what gets him back. I'm y'all, let's get to work. would like him to come back now. That would be wonderful. Anyway, you've got to have another baby up in here.
00:05:20 - Seth Ellsworth
Pretty nuts.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so...
00:05:25 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm not thinking about it too hard. stressful.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, everything will be okay. Nothing's straging yet, and we're promised that our enemies will not prevail over us. Right?
00:05:50 - Seth Ellsworth
That is correct. Where is mine? I'm trying to bring up my iPad so that I can...
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:05 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay. My apple pencil is not charged either.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So.
00:06:13 - Seth Ellsworth
So you can use your finger. You can also use the whiteboard here. Okay. going to decide where to start here. So the direct inbox. Sales page and tracking. Is all working. So now my full focus is on getting. The automation backbone. Solid. And that has been. Tricky because. Because I'm trying to do some unique things here that I thought were easy and it turns out that it wasn't as easy, but I think I have it solved. And then from there. I have a lot of ideas for the email automation. I'm actually excited about that. That has been a real huge question mark, but the call that I had with talking more than his boardroom clients. Last week. Was really great, probably more for me than them, because. I got to spend a couple hours on there with him afterwards and he helped with a bunch. So I'm going to explain to you firstly. The. That's my three year old. Two year old banging on the door.
00:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just once I hear it.
00:07:58 - Seth Ellsworth
No problem.
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:08:07 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah. You You Okay. Sorry. Michelle is in bed. She is that she's at the point of not sleeping.
00:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, it's exhausting.
00:09:28 - Seth Ellsworth
And we're. Everything's chaos at the house because we're moving everything around and moving rooms and. Anyway. All right, I'm going to. I'm going to show you that the few pillars here. I think I have everything down to really two or three simple concepts. That are. Really easy for people to understand. It makes sense. And I'm the only person talking about them. They're super unique. The value is kind of obvious, but the first, the first problem that people are having is with delivery. We're talking about email specifically. Second problem is opens. And third problem is sales.
00:10:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:10:25 - Seth Ellsworth
So you have, if your emails aren't getting delivered, you can't get opens. If your emails are delivered, that doesn't necessarily mean you have opens.
00:10:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you have opens, it doesn't necessarily mean you have sales.
00:10:38 - Seth Ellsworth
So all of these things didn't actually flow this way. the concept of delivery. Is solved by a little bridge here. The concept is really this. Our job is to prove to the email service. providers like Google that you are family. If you can prove that your family, you're not subject to the same deliverability rules that everyone else is, which is why your mother can send you you know political chain email about some conspiracy theory with 97 links in it and it never ever ever gets sent to this sandbox. And so that concept of becoming family instantly makes sense to people and nobody's really going to argue that because it's 100% true.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I'd argue that I'm just asking how would you how would you prove that? Well you're proven with the simple concept of it, one's the last time an email from your mother was sent to spam.
00:11:58 - Seth Ellsworth
And if you're in the same cat February. In terms of how Google sees your business, the likelihood of you ending up in the spam box is very low.
00:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:12:10 - Seth Ellsworth
So it's not. I don't have a ton of data to prove this out yet, but the cause you just said you said the key thing right there.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would just make sure that that's always there. When's the last time the message from your mother ended up in the spam box, even if you wish it had.
00:12:29 - Seth Ellsworth
Right.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because for sure wouldn't read that content, that type of thing.
00:12:34 - Seth Ellsworth
And so I'm thinking that my ads can revolve around that singular concept. Because essentially, that's what DTI delivers. helps. If you're having 60 to 80% of your new subscribers reply to you, you look like family.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:57 - Seth Ellsworth
Because businesses don't get replies like that.
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
effort. Yes, love that.
00:13:03 - Seth Ellsworth
And that's the whole concept. And that allows you to completely ignore all the massively technical aspects of delivery. so we saw this for 10 bucks. The first time I implemented it, it took 10 minutes. So I'm using the $10 for 10 minutes thing. It's probably going to take others much longer than that. But it sounds good. Okay, so that's the concept that then allows your emails to be delivered. Now how do we get them opened? Now here's, here's, we have an automated, let's see, we have 80% opens. Which is interesting and there's there's two there's two side. There's two Good So they eight percent opens is is set off by five seven ten day email automation So the What's different, let me put this in a different color We talked a little bit about this before I think via text messages, but I've been struggling with like what the upsell is Right And I think the upsell is just the ninety five dollar course, but Do you have the ninety five dollar course defined?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or even outlined so what's that and so this is how this is how
00:15:00 - Seth Ellsworth
I'm going to approach it. Now that you have delivery, how are we going to get opens? Well, it starts with an automation. And so the process that allows for sales, and then I forgot to do this part, which is the ongoing broadcast emails on into the future of 60% to 80%. So in order to maximize sales, in the short term and the long term, what we do is we make sure that we nail delivery. We run people through a five to 10 day email automation, and then that allows us to sell efficiently. And then on into the future, your broadcast will typically fall between 60% and 80%. And that's when you do this properly. So I'm leaning towards. I'm confusing myself, where did I over-complicate this?
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you were talking about the $95 up-so, but one thing I would love, because this is the first time you've said something that I've been listening for, and that's delineating the difference between open rates for sequences versus broadcasts, because you say this gets 80% open, there are going to be plenty of people going, that's , you can't do that. Not consistently, not across the board, with all things, you can, but there are caveats to it, right? Sequences that have been specifically designed and engineered, right? with all the things. And your process will improve broadcast, but broadcasts are handled differently by ESPs. So that changes things a little bit. And what I would love to see you say so that you're being more responsible with language is 80% open on sequences, maybe in parentheses underneath it. And maybe there's an asterisk or something, but just a truth and marketing kind of thing. Trusting the Lord to bless you for being different even in that aspect, right?
00:17:50 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah.
00:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because one of the things I think one of the hallmarks of Seth Ellsworth is I'm different. I do things differently. I get different results because I do things differently. I want you to lean into that always and that difference is a few things. It's that they go left, you go right, but you go right because you feel inspired too. But the difference is also you have the story of the old lady. I can't remember her name, but I want to remember her name that lost money because you sold her something. You said enough sold her.
00:18:41 - Seth Ellsworth
What's her name?
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nancy. Right. So you have Nancy that you'll never forget because you had it, what you did to sell affected her life so powerfully and negatively. that you swore never to do that again. So you always are, and I don't think you're going to lose sales because of it. I think that it actually is more powerful, especially for the people who are willing to do the work, because even at $10 they still have to do the work, that you're purposely not making salacious claims. You're making powerful claims, true claims, but there are caveats and nuances. anyway, just these tiny little nuances, right, to the language I think makes a difference where you separate the difference between, and you can even inform them of the difference between sequences and broadcasts, because I've seen where people had great email health, and then they went from sequences to broadcasts.
00:19:57 - Seth Ellsworth
Everything else was the same.
00:19:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They were this computer. their messaging was the same. Their sender score immediately dropped, tanked. Everything went to spam box after that. So there is a mechanical difference, a qualifying difference between broadcast and sequences at the ESP level that people should be aware of that affects their open rates because it affects their inbox placement. So anyway, we haven't talked about that and since you're really diving into this and I think that you're going to master this, I think it takes a little while to build up at this price point for it to be really valuable for you. But what I think, Chris or Chris, Seth, is that, as you have a Chris reminder come up, that this is going to be a compounding thing that your audience is going to compound that your business This is going to compound that you will be because you're going to continue studying all of this an email master, but, but that also aligned with a bigger purpose to me, which I think is your master of teaching of learning, I think you're a master student of the Lord, and many other things, but I also, and the best student ever of all time is the best teacher of all time. Jesus, we know he was the best student of all time, because who did he learn from constantly? His father, he was always learning. That's what made it the best teacher. You know what mean? So you're doing the same thing, but everything that people are sending in email, the things that people engage with the most is kind of entertainment. It's we're learning from whoever we're buying from. The reason that we're buying is because we learned some thing to convince us to purchase, right? So you're teaching people how to teach better, you're teaching people how to lead better, even though it's email, you're teaching people how to email better, but the reason their email is working better is because you're teaching them how to communicate better, how to engage better, how to lead better, and the result is people want to read from them more, and people trust them enough to buy the thing that they're recommending. So you're not just the email guy, you're the teacher, you're the maestro, you're like, you know what I mean? And I see this really developing huge, but I think the cornerstones of it have to be around integrity and just saying like this is exciting, it's hyperactive, it's all of those things, like it is new, brand new, in terms of so people do it and it's powerful and it's almost magic but it's dressed up as work wearing overalls because you have to do some the difference is you only have to do a little bit like that's my whole thing right people stay work smarter not harder i actually make it happen most people that say that can't do it i've mastered it nope so that's that i think that's where you're at you are this the supreme leverage of email anyway okay $95 up so um so you've you've handled direct you've handled inbox placement $10 the next issue is open rate you have a $95 product which what is that is that we'll talk about the we'll talk about the the products in a second okay um so so this these are the content
00:24:00 - Seth Ellsworth
concepts that string together. I think I could use the family concept in the ads probably so I might need another concept here like an automation or whatever. But we have delivery opens and sales and the difference is how to get opens, well, this is how you structure the the intro or the I don't have a good name for the onboarding experience when somebody enters your world. This is how you structure that automation. That's what I'm going to be giving away for free as the as the reply-based value. It's here's how to structure an automation that gets 80% opens and I'll show them the structure. And then from there it's what do you get the automation to do in order that you make sales. That's where you let we layer on top the concept of completion versus conversion. And then that unlocks something I'm playing with is this idea of 80-20 which is 80% opens and 20% conversion. I don't think those are crazy numbers. When people do it this way, I don't want to suggest that they'll get 20% conversion.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you but you can reference the parietal principle and you can very quickly show the evidence that that's the case. Now you can say this isn't a claim but there's a reason we keep hearing about 80-20 over and over and over again. It's 100% possible. Probably depends on you. Depends on how well your able to execute and I can't guarantee your ability to execute what I'm teaching you. So there's your caveat. But the probability of somebody doing the optimal, you know, psychological and mechanical operational approach to email says that the Pareto principle takes into account anyway. First of all, that 80% of the wealth is created by 20% of the people. Can you be in that 20% like we talk about being 1% but you don't even have to be 1% and nobody says that. Nobody says that because it's so much easier to be in that 20% than it is to be in the 1% right? So and you can steal that but you better give me some credit because I'm about to go on that one. But that's the reality is we're told that it's harder than it is but it's not actually. So anyway, yeah, you can make that claim if you, if you say it rightly and you borrow from evidence that's already been presented that everybody already knows.
00:27:18 - Seth Ellsworth
Perfect. Well, that's the concept. I mean, 80% opens, 20% And that's what makes you open on sequences.
00:27:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just going to keep tagging.
00:27:30 - Seth Ellsworth
You can tell me no, but that's, that's all I think you should write on this on this stuff. And then 60 to 80% ongoing forever. Ideally, that's the. mean, is it possible that forever? No. If your list is stagnant and you're not dumping fresh leads in there, like it's going to stagnate at some point. But like I haven't sent an email that hasn't gotten 60% opens in a long time. And I don't even have any automations for this yet. So it'll just get better from there.
00:28:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:28:04 - Seth Ellsworth
Um, and I proved that on the call and everybody was blown away. I could give them a screenshot. This is the screenshot of every email I sent for this promotion. And these are all broadcasts. And the worst one was 64% open rate. And they have about lost it. Um, so, so here's these, these are the, these are the things that I'm going to sell here. So, so these are the concepts per se. what I'm selling is how to become family, essentially, and also how to get completion, um, which is what the, the, the $95 workshop is about. And then from there, we, we go directly into the $300 per week offer. Um, which teaches you. you had to do all of this. And we implement it. So that's kind of an implementation, folks, hey, would you like to, you know, do all of this and get of full funnel? I don't think we need any more things to sell than those. Well, the upsell to a power day, I think you should be building in. Right. I mean, that's always in there. I'm not going to not sell that because that would be silly. But in terms of like the $10 thing leads to this and this leads to that. Yeah. That's pretty much it. The $25,000 stuff is going to easily come out of this.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, my dog is playing it.
00:29:52 - Seth Ellsworth
There's also a $9,800 a yearly buy.
00:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which saves them how much?
00:30:05 - Seth Ellsworth
I think $300 a week for 52 weeks is $15,600.
00:30:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you definitely need a good powerful sales letter that points that out.
00:30:25 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't. I was told to, if you want buy in on the 9800, put it on the order page and have a beast of prize.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I'm mostly saying where you have the 9800 specify that that's how much it saves them.
00:30:47 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So the. I don't know if you've seen this or not.
00:31:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry.
00:31:10 - Seth Ellsworth
I said that link real fast and you'll see the. I don't. So I only say 37%.
00:31:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could definitely. Oh, for sure. You want to give the number. The this the dollar amount savings is what really matters to most people. 37% is like that's an average savings. Yeah.
00:31:43 - Seth Ellsworth
So 300 times 52 is 1516. That saves you $5,800. $100.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I thought this was in her mind right now. She plays tag with a deer, there was a baby deer that were born a few years ago and they used to sleep underneath my front deck and now they just come and they chase her ear. She barks and the other dog too but mostly it's her and she has started bouncing night deer down. She like springs up and down like they do and the deer are not scared of her. They run at the fence and go up and down within, if she gets called into the house and can't play anymore, they just stare there waiting for her. Yes, it is annoying because she barks a lot and I have annoyed neighbors, but it's also the cutest thing to watch a deer and a dog play together.
00:33:14 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, that's that's a viral that's a viral thing right there.
00:33:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but it's nobody else's business so they don't get to see it. Okay.
00:33:27 - Seth Ellsworth
I just added want to say 5,800. Join us for 9,800 for a year immediate access to everything private on morning with set up plus quarterly one on once.
00:33:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so what I would do is change your start now to say 5,800 per year start now underneath it all in that button, which is huge. But it really it draws the attention right there. I can like if you set up split test, you could see almost always. that's going to win is having the save the price, save the amount of money on the button right there. When we finally get into being able to work regularly and can do split testing, have a team do all the operational stuff, I can't wait for you to see the tiny little things that make a difference quickly. But yeah, like we're barely even on the playground right now. We're mostly like looking at the playground. And then I just had a flashback to 1990 something with ABC, another bad creation at the playground in Ayesha, old songs.
00:35:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay, I'm just adding that to the button.
00:35:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's check it out. Refresh. I don't see it yet.
00:35:25 - Seth Ellsworth
You don't see it?
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did see the first thing when I refreshed, so... It's weird. Let me try it in the incognito browser. Nope. Let's In all your business, have you messed around with GPT 4.0 yet, or 4.0, not 4.0, but... Okay. What you've experienced before, it's 10 times better than anything, so... I think that we'll be able to start using this to help you knock out some stuff pretty quickly. You can upload with more. I'm pretty sure it can read videos now, so in terms of feeding it a stuff library and getting it to help you with copy. Framework, right, so you go through and tweak it, but it should reduce your workload significantly, not because it did everything for you, but because it started everything for you. Yeah. Right. Let's try to see if it. Man, come on. Let me see this. I'm going to type a box of new notifications. What's going on? If you go into an incognito browser, can you see the change?
00:37:26 - Seth Ellsworth
No, I saw it immediately.
00:37:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In an incognito browser, where you're not signed in. Let me put it in Safari.
00:37:44 - Seth Ellsworth
Instead, I always use that. Yeah, it shows up for me.
00:37:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just. Okay. Yeah, I'm in Safari, which has never loaded that site and I can't see it. That is very strange. Let me do it from my phone.
00:38:00 - Seth Ellsworth
Whoops.
00:38:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. Email. Actually. All right, now I see it on my phone. That's good. Awesome. Good job. don't know why I don't see it here. It's. Available publicly. Okay. Let's make sure we. Get the best out of this time together. So. First of all, did you already know? No, I feel like you've solidified some things today. Just had it in your head, but solidified like what the upsell is. Where? Just run through your head about what has to be built. So obviously, you need an ad. You need a landing page sales page, which you have. You need to follow up sequences. You need to be able to deliver this stuff. So this $95 course, where have you got that?
00:39:26 - Seth Ellsworth
Right now, the sales page just sells the recordings of the workshop.
00:39:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'll get it done, because that and what you're going to put them in the email list group, right?
00:39:40 - Seth Ellsworth
Correct. The email list, they get access to everything.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so actually, but so how would you support the people who paid for all the recordings at $95? Would you, what kind of support would you offer?
00:39:55 - Seth Ellsworth
There's no support for purchasing.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so. It's just for the knowledge and the information and the recorded videos.
00:40:03 - Seth Ellsworth
Are there transcripts? I put those videos up on an entrepreneur page.
00:40:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you get me a link to one of your videos and let's try chat dbt and see what we can scrub out of that right now on a call? Or what? Because if we can pull out not just a transcript but bullet points like you can create a quick PDF support and just add the the feeling. First of all the searchability, the access like I hate watching videos. If I can get timestamps and you can tell me where I can go back to go find the thing that I want. If you can give me like a table of contents for each of the videos, chapters, things like that, then I know exactly where to go. So maybe people watch it the whole way through. but then they want to go back and go, okay, where was this thing? You've saved them from having to scrub through it. And now here's a quick little, here's this, here's that, here's this. And then if you have a little bit more time, what you can do is find some screenshots or whatever to go back with it. And now you've got an additional thing with the PDFs quality content that helps people who process information differently. So you've got the audio people, you've got the visual people, you've got the audio visual people, you've got the, I can't read anything or I can't listen to anything. You've covered them all, which means you're going to be able to serve more people better because you've provided the content across different ways.
00:41:59 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh. I've got 15 minutes before I got a call of landing, right, so okay, so what I what I did is I just sent you an email or okay. just sent you access to, at least if I did it right. To the team of Maria systems at Gmail. That's the right one or not, but that'll work. That should give you access to the delivery page where a content is. There's really just two videos on there. But they're longer videos.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't have anything. Do you have, do you happen to have them on like Google Drive or anywhere else or are they just on your computer?
00:42:58 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't use Google Drive for more.
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
anything.
00:43:01 - Seth Ellsworth
Okay, but you should get an email a second. It looks like I added the right tag. So we're waiting for our automation to get it to me. Well, that's how that's how it works. Okay, I can't send you here. Yeah, either way, you have to be cookie in order to see it. Otherwise, you won't, you'll go to the page and you won't be able to access it.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the video only exists an entrepreneur?
00:43:37 - Seth Ellsworth
No, you can't play the video unless you have a proper cookie that says they.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm not a customer. I'm trying to help you with this. So that's what I'm asking you. Does it basically exist anywhere else where you can share it with me, not in the system?
00:43:52 - Seth Ellsworth
I don't need to see in the system. can I can give you, let me find the email links. All right, let me make sure those are all viewable. This one should be unlisted. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I sent those to your text message. I don't know if that's useful or not, but you.
00:45:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'll work. Sorry we couldn't find that page. Maybe he has to be logged in.
00:45:50 - Seth Ellsworth
right, so it should be, it should be good. I just switched them all to unlisted so you should be able to see them.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you click on the links, the links might have changed when you did that. don't know, but I just clicked each of them and two of them I clicked after you changed it. So it's not a cookie issue.
00:46:30 - Seth Ellsworth
Oh, You There we go.
00:47:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, good. can see previous. So that means it's definitely going to work. OK.
00:47:30 - Seth Ellsworth
OK.
00:47:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. See how fast. I can do it. Does Vimeo offer you transcription?
00:48:09 - Seth Ellsworth
Nope.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:48:13 - Seth Ellsworth
So what I would like to upload it to like Loom or something and that give you an instant transcription.
00:48:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I upload it to anything or if you're willing to use Dropbox or a cloud something, give it to me. I'll download it. I'll get the transcription. But yeah, if you have something you can get the transcription, let's do that because I really think that this is going to simplify your copywriting, writing your emails, writing your creating support. I think that I think it will give us a lot. Any of the videos that you have that are training around email lists, having a cloud so that that I can can get access and I can help you chat GPTA40 is night and day difference from the previous versions. And it's trained very quickly. It's, it is so much, it's just so much better stuff. Because so let's see, you let me go check base camp and see what you have already created for assignments for this funnel. Where would I find it? Because you don't have a DTI project. Have you written out the task for what needs to happen to get this as a full funnel life?
00:49:47 - Seth Ellsworth
Yeah, it's it's the 30,000 foot view or Yes. Okay. I mean, it's still in
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
July down. Yeah, it's still in the dump format, but okay, I haven't updated this in a minute, but generally It's okay because I know you have to go soon What I'm going to do when you get me those videos is I'm going to capture all of the task lists And I'm going to capture our content and I'll spend a couple hours with chatgbt Trying to create as much of a framework as possible Then let's reconvene Um Can you do next Tuesday? I'll send you what I have before then so you can get to work potentially before then but let's get a tentative call for next week And Tuesday is 60 Yeah, but I am not available until almost let's see That I mean Yeah, I'm going to have to do that. So that's 10.30. I'll be down by 12. Then I have to drive home to 12.30, my time, 130, your time, around 145.
00:51:17 - Seth Ellsworth
Your time?
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, 245, your time, sorry. Wait, no, 12.45, my time, 145, your time. OK, let me put this on here. If we have to reschedule, we can. I am going to send you some stuff at a time. So there, go ahead. What? OK, cool. That time, I just want to make sure I get this on here before we get out the phone. So when can I expect you to have that stuff somewhere uploaded for me? All of the videos that you have around any of the email.
00:52:00 - Seth Ellsworth
um trainings that you've done. I have them all in everything's in Dropbox that I've ever done.
00:52:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, can just share that with me then. If you can, if you will, or move it into a folder that is shareable, however you want to do it, but that would be the thing to do.
00:52:19 - Seth Ellsworth
We'll figure that out.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There we go. It's going to be the usual line. I'm not going to copy it, paste it. Um, a usual paste. That's my brain, usual line. Okay. Save, send, obviously 1245 my time, which is 145 year time. Okay. Um, good job. Uh, anything else that, um, you need help with just any mental blocks, any encouragement, anything, like how can I help you in the next five minutes?
00:53:06 - Seth Ellsworth
I mean, I'm not really sure.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's your biggest struggle right now?
00:53:13 - Seth Ellsworth
Yesterday, I spent 14 hours trying to figure out how to get make.com to work. To help my funnel because one thing on report does not do. Is any any sort of reply based automation. And this is going to be a core piece of my funnel is driving people to reply. And that's what is the upsell is on the reply page. So I want to drive people to the reply and it's a value based upsell. I teach them a new concept. And upsell them. So tracking all of that and making it part of the funnel was way harder.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you accomplish it?
00:54:02 - Seth Ellsworth
I think so. There's one little thing that's not working as I thought it would.
00:54:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the next time you get stuck on an automation thing, I would love you to work with this young lady that I hired who she may not know what to do yet, but she is very good at figuring things out. She loves automation. She's excited about it. She communicates very well. She's the $15 hour Filipino, but she's still cheaper than almost everybody else who is really good at this stuff. Because the sooner we get you support, I realize the money's not there and that's eventually what you want to do, but the thing is you'll get to the money faster when you get help faster. So what you can teach her, her ability to problem-solve by the information and keep trying is high and good. So I think that that would be worth your while and I can introduce you at any point when you're ready so that's something to keep on your hat because this is you want to direct that this is the thing to do this is where we're doing it this is the overall thing but we don't want you doing the mechanics of it and the operations of it and the sooner we can get you out of it like that 14 that's so draining that is so draining that piss yes exactly so tapping into somebody else even for $15 an hour and that'd be $150 plus whatever else like almost $200 but still that $200 you probably would have gladly spent if we could have made the same amount of progress and you didn't do it no for sure so at any point let me know I will introduce you and I feel like she has the capacity to learn and figure these things out so that's definitely need help because it's
00:56:00 - Seth Ellsworth
It's not, uh, I mean, not, not just automation stuff, but, but helping somebody help me.
00:56:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, especially on the technical side of it, and then on the customer service side, I can always find you somebody quickly. I just don't know. Well, like we haven't talked about finances for a while, so I haven't talked about freaking out. So are you getting money somehow from your, your, I mean, I have to get by, but we still haven't paid rent.
00:56:29 - Seth Ellsworth
Today is the first of the month. So kind of the same situation, but not as urgent because I have some, I have a movement. Okay.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not like going to collapse mentally because you have enough to keep from that. Yeah.
00:56:51 - Seth Ellsworth
I mean, I'm not collapsing mentally, but there's not enough.
00:56:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're just, um, we're good.
00:57:00 - Seth Ellsworth
more resilient and we're closer, we're closer than we've ever been. And I know this stuff is gonna crush.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just me managing my mentors in order to get the work done. Yeah, let me make sure that this works. I'm gonna send you her profile. So we'll start with one person at a time. This is the most powerful person that we need for you right now. It's in chat. I'm also gonna text it to you. So tell her that I sent you her new client, Tina, Tina Maria, whatever, recommended you her. And I'd be happy to get on a call with both of you. You can zoom like she speaks great. Screenshare, she gets it started as soon as you can, teacher everything. And I'm happy to help manage that in any kind of way. But the sooner we get you one type of support help to offload some things. So it would be this person first. And she has worked in on support. I don't know how efficient she is at it, but it doesn't matter. All it is is a matter of navigational stuff. The function, understanding functions and possibilities and what things are supposed to do is more important than understanding the navigation. Because then she learns the navigation. So she understands the functionality of automation and what's possible very, very well.
00:58:36 - Seth Ellsworth
Yep, I got to jump on to this call. Okay, go, care, talk to you soon. Yep, see ya.

Hey, hey, long time no see I know it feels like I don't like it.
00:00:08 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's been a month or so. Yeah, I didn't know if we were meeting today or that was like a legit invite. I guess you get it set up now for monthly calls.
00:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, I mean, we could do we could do every other week. Um, like I don't and just figure out what works for you. You've been very busy and very quiet with your head down working. So yeah, I don't know what to do. I don't know what you need, what you want right now.
00:00:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, it's just, uh, you're in a good flow. It seems like. Yeah, I mean, I'm just my day. I mean, it's summer. So yeah, so it's really about like maximizing the mornings and, um, I mean, I, I work. in the afternoon too, but like, it's just mornings just my jam. So like, it's actually, it's funny. was actually getting ready to write an update.
00:01:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good. I did, I thought the morning six, twenty six, twenty four. I was like, oh, I'm like, okay. And I left some comments too, but mostly just about what I want to talk about from the notes that you left last week. But so go ahead.
00:01:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, I mean, just, I guess just quickly, like, things are going well with Tim, Tim's the Jim Profit, Jim Solutions guy. I'm working on a new sales letter, well, promotion for probably middle of July, so I'm looking out for them.
00:01:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And and your results paid for many months of working with you.
00:01:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that's pretty. Yeah, in our officially our. 90 days will end on July 17th, so probably after the 4th, I'll send him an email and just acknowledge like, hey, we're coming up at the end of our 90 days. Do you want to continue working together and review the results of the promo and then this new promo that I'm writing for them?
00:02:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would recommend saying, hey, you know, that that last promo basically paid for me for the next nine months, so what do you say? Keep working together and here's what we do and that there's no way, you know, that you're not going to keep making more money for what I'm doing, so I'm thinking it's a no brainer and and I'm telling you because I just did that with one of my attorneys. So last year, I talked to, so I have an attorney that has another office and he's got like, sits attorney.
00:03:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
journeys that work for him.
00:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Last year, I talked to two of them. One of them was his top performer and one of them was his bottom performer. And the top performer was like, I don't need you, I'm good. Which was okay, because she's the top performer. the other one was like, yeah, I've got all these goals, I could do this, I could do that. And I gave them a couple of books. I, you know, after listening to him, I'm why don't you just work on this one thing? And he did, and he doubled his attorney fees. So he went from a million dollars to two million dollars attorney fees. And so this last week, I was talking to him, because he was talking about wanting to do some work. I'm like, well, I mean, the results paid for itself last year. You could be in pay me every month and you'd still be in profit from hiring. So that's a brainer.
00:03:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You guys. Oh, yeah, you're right.
00:03:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, just don't think about what the return is. And so just pointing it out in simple math, like right in front, like, you know, when we do the numbers exercise, the numbers just make it a no-brainer. like, oh, duh, I mean, already ROI form the initial investment plus eight more months, you know. So it's just, if you want the job, that's the no-brainer offer.
00:04:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll, yeah, I'm thinking after the fourth is when I'll put any mail together, but that's, you know, and I'll definitely point out, like, you know, we brought it, we did 45k to own our first promotion. And what are the profit sharing, like, profit partner kind of arrangement? Yeah, I mean, I think that that can be in the future. I mean, honestly, like, right now, I mean, I kind of, I kind of like getting the 5K every month and, and that, that feels like it's serving more what I need right at the moment.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just guaranteed it's there.
00:05:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah, but it's also giving me just like, I mean, the competences, I'll just say it. I feel like there's a better word, it's giving me Or it's holding my eyes to like, you know, I can, like, I can go and if this falls through with Tim, like, I'll, I'll go to somebody else and I can handle, you know, writing their copy of their emails. I think one of the things I've learned working with Tim is like, because. He's got a very specific strategy that he's wanted to do, that he is doing in a space with group, and we're following this client and community guys for Stapleton, and he's got a partner for his name, but you know, it's like I'm writing, I guess this is the first time that I'm really executing on what the actual work to be like a lightweight influencer of sorts, and I say lightweight because it's only like one post a day where I think of like a TikTok influencer or putting out a bunch of short form content, so it's a different type, but it's a different type of content, and it's, I was thinking about this, like I think It really is the first time that I've done this kind of thinking and work of like creating social media content, tying it to a promotion that I know is coming to three weeks from now and thinking about like seeding these little agreements in my posts. And that and that's that part is cool. But I where I'm going with that is like I kind of that like that's fun to think about for somebody else and do it for them. It is not the thing that I would want to do for me as a guest. So yeah, there are two things I want to talk to you about right there.
00:07:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So first of all, you're doing one of my favorite strategies, one of my favorite levers, which is getting paid to learn and to sharpen yourself off. So this is a really, really viable skill, even if you don't want to do it. or so doing it for other people, it's important to know the logistics of how it works and why it works. I'm the same way I don't want to do any of the stuff for myself. What I can do for everybody else, I almost always cannot do for myself. I can do a little bit of it. But I think about doing it for myself and like new, not going to happen. Just I can, I won't. Part of that by the way is in alignment with 80 and negative dysfunction. And that can be a really normal thing for most entrepreneurs.
00:08:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It tends to be for like all of my clients.
00:08:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can always treat everybody else differently. So there's that. But if you have enough clients of your own, we're not doing a lot of work, we can hire somebody that can do this for you. That will extract from you what they need to do. That's very good at doing this. But because you already have the skill and knowledge, when they're driving, you can go actually, why don't we tweet this and that? So it goes to the same kind of thing that you like to do when it comes to copy, which is copy cheating, not the junior copywriting, right, you don't want to start from scratch. So if you have enough funds where you can hire somebody for maybe $1,000 a month. And obviously, you'd need to be where you're really comfortable and you've got that. So the goal would be maybe another Tim or two, if it doesn't take a lot. Because that's an extra $10,000, which you could even use for a junior copywriter, you know, a little bit of it. So, so that you're not adding too much work. But that could be really leveraged. And so now you can hire somebody to work in your own business, who's very skilled, but you don't need a lot of time to build out a social media campaign. So it's not like they got to work 40, 20 hours, you know, maybe 10 hours.
00:09:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But it isn't about the hours, it's about the results.
00:09:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if they're really good at what they do, you know, if you're just paying like, it's a flat rate, here's the job. Do you agree to accomplishing this job? for this amount of money and you know so it's you know per the project or whatever you can do that and there's a lot of people with that skill now you know now versus three years ago four years ago 10 years ago like it's so much different yeah um so but you being sharp on this and the extra money coming in um the tea money I feel like is for sure going to come in don't know what the titans numbers look like but you guys have been pretty steady you've learned about what the bootcamp does you're doing the podcast app you didn't leave any notes about that so I'd love to know about that but it feels like you're leveraging and you're building this um financial kind of moat and hedge that could support you having a small surgical strike team for yourself yeah um I have thought about just needing just getting one other person like a copywriter
00:11:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
down the road if because I'm thinking like I could do that I could get another time like I could manage that and I would bring on somebody to help with that and but I don't feel ready to take that step and go out and pursue that just yet but it's on my mind and I've got a few people in mind that I would reach out to that I feel like I could get a it wouldn't be hard to get a yes from them and they would well I guess I don't know if they would pay five grand but I was like that that's gonna be my my minimum that's gonna be my to do what I do and cuz like it Like I put my whole My brain into this and like I consume all their go through all their courses and you know the to just learn the product and I just feel like the level of service that I Bringing in the the copy that I fruit not just a copy of just like thinking through like I put the whole promotion or the bonuses and like all this Like the whole package like it's Yeah, I just realized like that that's what I am gonna do. That's what I'm gonna want to do because I feel like that's gonna Give us the best chance of succeeding and so for that You know, I'm grand Which I think is an insane deal and bargain Which is why I was talking about when I was talking about the profit sharing and I was talking about a flat rate of five grand plus
00:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know a percentage of like a very tiny percentage like maybe even one percent of the net profits from the promo.
00:13:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like not a business just from the promo like a performance bonus. Yeah, that could be a possibility. And they're great guys. It's 10 and I don't know if they're super great and laid back. And they're very hands off. know, this is awesome. They don't get in my way.
00:13:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean you've earned that too with who you are. You have a reputation, you're in an environment where you are positioned as an authority and so but there are people you know that they do know how to do that research and spend that time studying everything I think a lot of the female copywriters are probably more in line to do that and not charge a whole lot but there's also a lot of copywriters who just aren't they're not marketers for themselves so they can sell everybody else's stuff but themselves so they don't charge the highest rates they don't ask super high fees and but they just want consistent work and they want to work with good people that don't abuse them these copywriters who get abused a lot like they're responsible for all the sales even if there's crappy product bad people who don't know how to manage their business give good information, um, they're lying about what they're trying to sell, like all kinds of things, right? But it's a copywriter's job to make everything work. That and the media buyers, like that's it, some of the most ridiculous kind of expectations that are put on those type of people. But for you, like, if you had, let's say, two more clients and then you wouldn't want to do them back to back go in for yourself and really know their stuff inside out. Um, you know, like, I don't like to stack on new clients all at once because I, I, I dream about everything. Like, that's how much it's in my head because I don't know things yet. And my brain can't stop thinking about it because I have all these questions until I have a really good view of things or a good enough view. literally can't rest mentally. because I'm still trying to work it out and process it. And so, you're going and you're learning all these things. And I know your brain is always going. You're always thinking about stuff. So you had to kind of keep that in mind. But if you set the intention of trying to find somebody that you can work with that chart is a lot less than you do, that can do some different stuff, like maybe you give them an assignment of going through all these sales pages, all these email sequences and coming back and giving me a report. What this is, give me a few samples. instead of digging into all the different sources, you can just look at this. Maybe it's a document with a snapshot of here's a here's a literal picture of some of the copy from the website, some of the copy from the thank you page, some of the copy from the email sub all in one thing. So that's saving you time from click, click, click, click, click, right? But also what you know is that they've actually been into it, they've actually looked at it, and they've given you a report back and said, okay, here's what I see, right, this is a weak spot that they have, right, they're really not highlighting their USP, they really don't have a good hook, but here's a hook I did find, here's, you know what I mean, there's a process, and if you're looking at doing this for another 10, 20 years, 30, whatever, like I would imagine that long, I would like to see you make enough money where you can just start investing at your money's working for you. But you're going to be doing this for a long time anyway, so you really should be sending an intention of, I've got a solid junior copywriter or two that I'm working with who are, you know, really happy to be working with me because I'm a good guy and I'm not going to get them bad clients, I'm going to give them, you know, as consistent work as possible, but they're still contractors, which means you're not their financial protector. looks like maybe is it a male or female is it there's a lot of childless women in the copy world I don't know you know but there are and they also do not charge the same kind of rates as their male counterparts they're very loyal they're incredibly smart and and they love working for really great people you're the type of person that would that they would love working with and working for so that's something that you can kind of just tuck in your cap and know um kind of set a magnet out you know looking for that because you've come across them throughout the talking you've mentioned this person that person whatever and I'm like that's very interesting to me because I've been noticing it more and more so anyway those are just some things to think about because you're right on that press this. It's going to be one day you're like, okay, it's time to pull the trigger. And that's very soon. Especially with the results you got with that promo.
00:20:09 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know, I know. well, I just turned out, yeah, yesterday, today's Wednesday, Monday, that there were three more new call appointments that came in last week for this week. they're using for the offer that I wrote. And they're using on their sales calls, the offer, the whole promo that I put together. Because before it was just here's an eight week course. We do weekly calls. And I turned it into this. Well, not an intern. Communicated what it actually was is not like I created something. It's just like they got so much more than just like an eight-week Course and yeah, but they would just we're doing a disservice and Leaving money on the table talking about it. Yeah, and now I'm working on this new promo, which is really cool It's all about how to turn switch your gym to is what's called a semi semi-private model and So it's like a hybrid of one-on-one and small group, but it's a four to six People in a class, but each one's got it their own individual customized workout and Like that's the model that Tim runs in his gym and they just you charge like a hundred bucks a week um for this kind of special specialized attention and community and You know at that at that rate like just to get to half a million in a year, you need less than 100 members doing a semi-private model and so it's, mean, can probably tell it's interesting to me because I'm into fitness, I don't really want to start a gym or anything, but it's interesting getting to know this market. And like just understand their financial issues and then now helping them make this switch to doing a semi-private model and seeing like how lucrative that can be for somebody who really is passionate about you coaching somebody and their fitness journey.
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, go ahead, keep on.
00:23:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
But like I was working on this promo today, I just went through all the training material, and that's the initial hook or headline that I'm working around. I'm going to write tomorrow morning around this idea, but it's something around how to build a $500,000 a year business with less than a hundred members, a $500,000 a year gym business with less than a hundred members. Something in that ballpark is where I'm thinking that that will be the hook, and then the sales letter describes how that happens.
00:23:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you happen to know the attrition rate?
00:23:48 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Not off the top of my head, but oh, for semi-private, it's not as high as tradition. like control access.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, so that's a hook right there. Yeah, that's a that's a massive hook right there because I would think it would be higher because of the amount of money. No, that means if I'm a business owner and I read that, I'm like, yeah, but like, how many people do I actually have to, how many times do I have to fill in that hundred, you know, like, and not everybody because I don't think everybody thinks about attrition, but I do. So, but anyway, but again, we'll have the numbers tell the story for you. Right, because it's a really powerful thing to say you only have to get 100 yeses, right, 100 people to say yes to this offer. don't need to get, you know, 500 or 1000 people like it's 100. And if the attrition rate, let's say it's 40%, you know, 140 people to say yes, that still sounds very doable. You break that up across, you know, the months or whatever, like just if you show them how easy it is, if you're providing this offer, this service, and also if you could show them, you know, where does it work? Does it only work in metro areas? Does it work in rural areas? Does it work in certain areas that have a medium income of X or whatever? Like if you were to do some data like that and do some case studies, put that on the website, which of course that takes time to build and to to see because it's a newer type of offer. But that's something that you can be working on with Tim and say, look, these are all the things that like basically build yourself a job for the next year. Like this is what we're building, this is what we're working on. We have to be getting these case studies. We're going to continue to get this data, but the data is going to continue to change as more people are doing it. going to get more information. But either way, like it's already paying for itself over and over again. And so get on board.
00:26:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Let's do this stuff.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, but you could also be in terms of like you always want to be giving back to people. You be changing the fitness industry where people actually might be showing up more consistently because they're actually getting one on one health customized health. It's semi-private. So, you know, they're not paying as much as they would. So it's a little like, but that's not the word restrictive. And, you know, it could be making something really great, more available to more people than it was, but also allowing the trainers and the gym members because they're working with more people consistently because you're helping them stay full, be able to sharpen their saws and get better at what they do. So, like, just a little criss over here with a copywriting $5,000 a month. But I was just like taking over making a huge difference in the world. to me, that's the kind of stuff I love about what I do in my business. And maybe nobody else is acknowledging the impact that you're making. But if you look at it, that's a huge impact.
00:27:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Totally. And I mean, really, the comparison, guess, the Apple, it'd be more Apple's to comparison my private to one-on-one personal training.
00:27:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, as I was thinking about it. Definitely. But there are, like I knew once that like orange theory, their average, do you know orange theory? No. that would be considered a large group model so that you go from station to station. Okay. So everybody's doing the same workout. You can have up to 30 people. know.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like circuitry.
00:28:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, but that's right now. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, so that'd be a large group model. And you can, you know, that you can make more than just doing like a general admission gym doing by having these larger groups. But like orange theory, they're, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for? The people leave on average after three or four months, their memberships last so long. usually it's not that, not that long. Um, but what ends up happening with, uh, semi-private is there's a, there's there's a onboarding, like there's a way that Tim sells it because I've gone through his training and, um, he, he kicks off the semi-private by bringing, he has a, an event because of the state of the union. as Jim, and he just brings in members and holds this two-hour event, and he just lets know where the fitness industry is going, then he introduces, he's got this whole script of how you introduce semi-private and compare it to one-on-one, but it's not as expensive as one-on-one, and then he's got two different ways he does contracts with people when they come in, so it's like, he's got a really solid team. I forget where I was going with that, but I do want to talk a little bit about Titans, switching gears, like Brian, he's been laying a little low. We've got the Over-Deliver Bootcamp coming up next month, and I'm I had a call with him. Oh, it his past Monday we met and he's having a procedure done on his on his heart. He shared with me a small, like outpatient, he said, but he's been having not, he said, I'm not going into a fib, which he was doing that like all the time before his last surgery, but he would he call it. Not palpitations or rhythmia, maybe.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what it was, I think.
00:30:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
you know, he's, he's, and he was apologetic. He's like, I know, I've been, he owes me things and I figured something was going on because he's, he's usually faster to respond. you've watched him withdraw and then seen why he withdraws. Mm hmm. Um, and I brought up, I said, we haven't talked about this event in a while, and last time we spoke like we were doing it in January, and he was like, ah, don't know. He started doing this thing that he does. And, um, he, you know, he's using, this is going to sound more, I don't know, know, to come across this way, but he's using his health as an excuse to not really think about the, the event and, and plan that. So, whether that's, you can say it's legit, like, all right, if you need to do that, then that's totally fine. And I'll just, I'll just accept that, like, that's It's what he needs to do, because I'm not going to tell him, you know, uh, the alternative, I guess, but, but it just got me thinking because then he was like, you know, I don't know, like January of 2026, we could do this event, but I was just like, you know, it since Monday, I just, I've always, um, I've always just felt like I'm on this little bit of a roller coaster. With Brian in terms of like how he wants to show up, and, you know, get, and he even told me, he's like, you know, I'm like two or three times your age, and, and I'm like, you know, there's going to be probably in the near future where he just wants to not do this anymore.
00:32:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that's where I'm pretty new. Like he's been sun setting for a while.
00:32:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't want to cut you off like I just, but that's, that is the thing. that we've been watching and there is, you know, there are kind of, at the very least right now, two things to look at. You have great respect and reverence for Brian and appreciation for him and overall this is his business. However, you have been deeply invested in it, you have nurtured it, you have been the primary reason for not only its growth, but its maintenance for probably the last four years or so. Whenever he had a stroke, I feel like it was around 2020, that wasn't it? It was around there, yeah. And you have not only been invigorating to his business, but you have been invigorating to his life. And it's not even about feeling entitled to any particular thing. even though you've earned stuff, it's that the writing is on the wall that Brian's pace is probably permanently changed. ability, like his fire is flickering. It's not extinguished. It bursts up a little bit. It goes down a little bit based on health, life circumstances, but it has definitely altered significantly, and I would be shocked if it's not permanently. I know he's a peptide, I do believe that there are miraculous things that can happen. I don't think Brian has the willpower and the drive inside of him to drive to it. He doesn't seem like a hardcore driven person anymore. Like I think that part has flickered out and been replaced by family and life, which is okay. But... I think that that was a priority shift that changed permanently. And if he truly does have everything that he needs set aside financially, that he doesn't have to make more money, then that has to come into it too. And you are just hitting your stride of like, I am a business man. I got skills, I can bring money, I can grow, and all of these other people, there's a market that is begging to be served, quality content, quality service. I'm here to do it, you know, and now you're being throttled. You've been throttled. You've been throttled since I met you with Brian not showing up. And this is with all due respect. It isn't about bad-mouthing him for it.
00:35:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I mean, we've had this conversation many times. We don't really need to say it, but I do.
00:35:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's just a real- be difficult situation to be in. So back to, you know, what can you do? I think, at some point, like, I think you really have to keep leaning into building the thing that you build, and pacing stuff out, and letting go of like, don't even try to plan events with Brian, you know, I just, because it will, you deserve to not be frustrated, but also the power of that frustration can be so detrimental to your happiness, to your peace, to your productivity, and all of your happiness and peace impacts how you show up as a dad. And even if it's just a slight diminishing, it's going to be perpetual because this is the pattern that Brian has over and over again, commit to something, doesn't do it for really valid reasons in terms of like, you know, but it, but that, that is what it is. So I would be looking for, how do we nurture Titans, Accelerator, and as with as little dependence upon Brian as possible, what does that model look like, where it's at the very least maintaining its revenue for you and for him, very at the very least maintaining its value and reputation, which I think that you can do like you could probably do all the over delivered book camps by yourself and people still feel good because you're showing up in the Titans world so much and so many of them are so new that and you've been there since day one, that's potentially it. You know, something to think about along that path but really just how do you build it independent of Brian where he can be like, surprise, I'm here. Yeah, everybody. I did not be, but nothing that requires he has to show up. think there's still a lot of financial potential for you, where that's not stressful. Because the other option is, like, can I at leaving, giving an ultimatum of like, this is how it's going to be, or maybe just give me a higher percentage because this is a lot to deal with, and also give me more power over what happened without having to get your approval, because you're bottlenecking and I'm trying to build and grow. And I understand why you're doing it. You've got real needs, but so do I. Like, I'm in business and I might give half at least of my time to this. anyway, that's a lot to think about. It's a lot to process. But maybe that's just something that you can work through because you tend to really Defer to just supporting Brian and just being like it is what it is and not taking care of yourself the way that you ought to and advocating for yourself. And I think that you should advocate for yourself I think that you have more than earned it. And it isn't just advocating for yourself, but the business and the customers that you serve, they need stability and reliability also.
00:39:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, you know, we're doing rolling out two things inside of TXL that I think is going to help with retention. One is you know about the public podcast, the timeless marketing and that's more about bringing people in, but we were also putting all the calls from TXL into a private podcast. Podcast. that only members can access, and so that's going to make it easier for everybody to be able to access the call recordings right from their phone, like inside the Apple podcast app or Pocketcast or whatever podcast app they use. And the other one is we're starting accountability pods within the group that's led by the members. And so they'll have a set schedule that they meet on. You know, they'll be independent of our two to three calls a month. And so the hope there is that that's going to help foster the community and get people connected. You'll hold people accountable to reaching the goals that they have. Those two things are giving or rolling out the podcast I'll announce, probably before July 4th, pods, I put the initial plan together and sent to Brian and this one of the things he owes me, all in feedback on, but I've been thinking, like don't feel anger or fear, I feel little after that call with Brian, but I've just kind of been thinking like, all right, I want to keep TX all going and I want to keep growing, break through advertising. And in the long term, I still would like to, you know, be a part of break through advertising for forever. you know, whenever the point comes of like Brian passes away, you know, we'll have, whenever Jean's wife Barbara passes away is when we'll because her son will get it. Yeah. Yeah. At that point.
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How old is she?
00:42:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, she's like 90 something. Wow. Yeah. She's, she's up there, but, um, yeah, and not rocking the boat, you know, when, when there's that kind of investment and, and I, it's not a just selfish, like I go, wait for him to die and I get this kind of thing.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that it's, I mean, all these relationships are nuanced, um, but that goes back to how do you nurture titans, independent. of Brian where he can just you know show up and less it when he wants to and can but that the stability of it is anchored on the things that you do steadily so that you know it's there you're taking care of he's taking care of and the market is taking care of like I think that you've gotten the ability to do that and I think that just not trying to have big events but I realize that there was a big part of it there's a lot of potential for it there's a lot of connection but but based off of every single year there's been something that has for the last four years at least that has really just been overwhelming for Brian and he's had to pull back for a while so and an event takes months and he he always, for the last few years, has seemed to be, and even before, you know, four years ago, in the beginning, you were like, he wants to get out of the masterminds, like the in-person stuff. So, he's been pulling steadily back out of showing up in person and overcommitting to things for years. That's just not, I can't see that changing. So, to even consider doing something like that and hoping it's going to be able to come to fruition, first of all, could be really detrimental to the brand because people get excited and they want to have it. And then, you know, can only get disappointed so many times before you like tease. Almost, you know, they're hardcore people. and it didn't hurt his brand. Well, you can't say that. But die-hard fans will stay die-hard fans.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know what I mean? Yep.
00:45:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not all you have in the market. And that's not the only people seeing the stuff that happens. It's also the new people coming in. And so just kind of taking that into account. I think that you can create the thing that just maintained a steady pace where you get to grow and serve the market and just kind of wait for the inevitable, even if it takes years, whether it's Jane's wife or Brian. But I think that compartmentalizing and just kind of putting titans into, putting TXL into like a portion of your day, portion of your week and really focusing on everything else that you're building would be really wise for you.
00:45:52 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, and the good thing about that is, you know, like, we do Do you have a small team that really runs?
00:46:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:06 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, and like the social media posts, the podcasting, the, you know, Jamie's handling all the tech stuff. Carlin and Margie are handling the renewals, TXL renewals. You got Jeremy and they're working with you too, right?
00:46:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's that? You got Jeremy Weiss and that makes two.
00:46:30 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for the podcast. Yeah. And, you know, that's that's humming along and.
00:46:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So big change from this time last year.
00:46:46 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, it's a big change and I feel like. There needs to be a way like to, I mean, I guess maybe it's just. I think that the area of improvement is running a regular promotion for TXL, which we just haven't been doing, and I was thinking about that because I was like, we're going to do this event coming up, and yeah, that is definitely on me getting these promotions running. I think part of it is like it's, it's not painful, but I can't think of the word, it's painful. it. That's That's That's That's That's That's And maybe that's not even what I'm trying to say. I think maybe it's like, we've been, I've put so much effort into putting the team together. I guess now is the point where I can look up and say, right, let's run some promotions. my mind just has not been on running promotions for TXL for whatever reason. And I think what I have in mind is like, we're gonna run these boot camps. Cause I know we're gonna do one next month, we'll do another one in the fall for breakthrough advertising. And that'll be how we bring them up.
00:48:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so the boot camps we know has a super high conversion rate, but they're also more work. It's a whole kind of thing, right, to build. But with the podcast now, you have Evergreen stuff, which is what we're talking about. And I don't know what you have going on, but. Um, there are like, I can think of Jeff Roning as an example with, um, whatever his webinar platform as I can't remember what it is. But, and there's some other people where they, um, are constantly promoting it and then send you to a page and it's like, it's closed. Um, but we'll open eventually, put us in your information and get on a waiting list. And so it feels like there's this scarcity. But really like magically 48, 24 hours later, you get a thing, hey, a spot opened up. Um, so there's that type of thing or there's just, you could just have an evergreen offer. And the scarcity is you don't have any more time to waste doing stupid stuff in your business. You don't have any more time to waste, not having a community support you. You don't have any more time to waste doing less than you could be doing. So, you know, instead of being just signing about it or super highly marked. reading about it, whatever, you just be like, this is the thing, you know, this is an exclusive group. We show up steadily. This is not like, if you're looking for XYZ, you know, high peace, slimy, marketing, get rich quick, selling lotto tickets, selling diet pills, meaning promised results that don't actually work and your odds of winning are next to nothing. Don't come in here, we don't want you. But if you want timeless skills, proven tactics, and you're willing to shock, do the work, wear your people, and you should come in here. And it's, you know, at the end of every episode or in the middle or front, middle end of the episodes, whatever. And then you just promote the podcast all over the place. Instead of promoting accelerator, let the podcast show the intelligence and the smarts and all the other things. and say also do you want to actually talk to us in person here so how many podcasters do you get to talk to in person how many people that you listen to as a mentor do you actually get to work with like this is your chance so it could be a very simple marketing campaign that is actually directed at guests right because they see you out there marketing which means they're going to be promoted higher quality guests better content better service to your people better reasons for them to go I got to get in there yep you know just looking we've got we've got a couple of like ad bumps in the podcast the one at the end we'll take listen to a basically
00:52:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
TXL Quiz, and then that puts them into our, if they're a new subscriber, they get welcome sequence and then promotions for TXL and boot camps. But let's see, that puts this quiz, 37, well 37 finished, but only 17 subscribed at the end, 51 started, 37 finished, 17 subscribers, so far.
00:52:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people have seen it?
00:52:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
51.
00:52:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's a good conversion rate. How many people heard the offer to take the quiz?
00:53:07 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't know because that comes at the end of the episode. don't know.
00:53:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get listening analytics?
00:53:20 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I know.
00:53:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there any way to get that?
00:53:25 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I can email Jeremy with that.
00:53:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to put this podcast in and out. But the conversion rate of how many people actually went there versus how many took it. And then how many subscribed?
00:53:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's. In in like now we're doing and this is just not even a month old now every Wednesday Brian is mailing the list Sending people directly to the to an episode And I that you know that's all the may see and Apple in the Philippines I don't know if I told you I heard this girl named Apple It was a referral from Macy and she she's done pretty well. I trained I Created a right like Brian GPT. Oh, yeah, and She's been using that and then she sends her drafts to Brian Brian edits and and then they they take it I don't touch it at all It's great I love that Yeah, I'll imagine Yeah, yeah So, yeah, I think with Titans, I don't want to get, I guess, my mind, the question is like, all right, know that this runway will end at some point, but like, there's no reason that we can't just keep this community going for as long as Brian, because I think he kind doing these big events, it's like, you know, just doing a better job of maybe running some ads for the podcast, getting people engaging that way, bringing them in, and just doing it simple, and then adding these stick strategies that improve retention is maybe have a bigger... impact overall. But I, you know, talk about protecting my energy. It was something we've talked about a lot like, I'm feeling internally like how much do I want to put into growing titans beyond what it is already versus, you know, that I'm, I see the difference working with Tim and Tim is very like, he's in it, you know, he's driven and it's, it's just a different feeling being part of something like that. Yeah. And they're, they're just constant activity.
00:56:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
very energizing.
00:56:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:56:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not only protecting your energy, but feeding your
00:57:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
energy. Yeah, because he's like, you know, we got a, we got a row in the same direction, because we got goals, he's got this event. And it's like, so I, I, that's crossed my mind of like, all right, how do I, you know, manage this tightens, like, what is that going to be? you could just give it a certain amount of time, and you can set your big rocks and goals and say, okay, here are these things that have to converge.
00:57:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Number one, this is how much time and energy I'm willing to give it period and the story. In that time and energy, these are the most important things that have to get done. When the time is up, times up, I've gotten the most thing that can done, it'll be what it'll be. And sink or swim, whatever. If you, if it ends up that you'll Like it needs more and there's money for you, the higher more, but you don't want to give it more. Great. If it's giving a good return and now you want to give it more, give it more. If it's not working, then maybe it's time to have a new conversation and not worry about what you've lost and consider all the things that has fed you, trained you, molded you, shaped you, be grateful for that. thank you everyone because sometimes that needs to happen. There are seasons and sometimes the seasons end.
00:58:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's interesting they're just looking, yeah, this is 3, 4, 6, 3, 2, it's going to look because we, the other thing that has been interesting to watch is you were selling brick-thru advertising mastery on Amazon. And last week, or last month, we almost came close to being completely out of inventory. We sent 20 books at the end of and we were down to one book at the end of May. So I got 30 more. Let's see how many books we have left. So I sent them 30, and some 30 at the end of May. Alright, so we got 23. So we sold 7. But what I was getting at, so this year, I don't know, you gotta go. Let see how many books we sold total because the whole reason we did Amazon was to see if people would buy it and then opt in. So this year total we've generated 23 leads from Amazon whether these are not leads or buyers, but we sold to find this right report here. Let me see how many books we sold. Oh, here we go, me see. Here we go, go, we we we we we go, here we go, here we go, we go, here Uh, the seller central is, um, sales dashboard.
01:02:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There you go.
01:02:12 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You're not here today. I'll do that.
01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's here today. Yeah, that's the same thing as you're today.
01:02:27 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh, I guess I was thinking it would take me back 12 months.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I see.
01:02:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
All right. So let's see what we saw. 50, 50 units. And then all right. we're got about half, half of those buyers who opted in. Okay. Um, so what was that last year this time? We weren't on Amazon this time last year.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. And we've got ads running on Amazon and those are, let's see.
01:03:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you able to, like, do you tag those opt-ins and can you tell if any of them have purchased Titans Accelerator?
01:03:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, we tag them. Oh, God. It started. Keep is forcing two-factor authentication.
01:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Starting today.
01:03:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I hate it.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh Do you want to do any of these tags instead of all? No? Oh, never mind.
01:04:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Got you got you got you Yeah, I just want to see Anybody to oh no, that's when oh, okay, Tom pools with a real person so one That's that pays out, you know, yeah, that's not Uh Unprofitable And the ads we'll see here the ads have done well to you on Amazon. Oh, here we go We're just doing like yeah 12 bucks a Measurement before Oh This looks 14 sales, this is over this is this year Yeah, all right guys, this is this year So we spent 1400 and we sold 2100 Yeah, so I mean Amazon's been doing well, you're just like, okay, yeah, I mean, what, that's six, seven hundred dollars, it's how much effort does do you put into it, nothing, it's just kind of set it and forget it. Oh, nothing. Yeah, that's good. I I ship, I get a book shipped to them.
01:06:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many people is that? How many customers? Oh, you said it was like 50.
01:06:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this year is like 50, 51. And I found a, well, didn't find it, but the guy who helped me set up the Amazon seller central here, he, I put him on a project to help me find a cheaper printer. For BAM, get down one. in China. I'm meeting with them maybe tonight. But I've already got a copy of the book that they printed for me so I could see their quality and it's really good. I sent it to Brian. He likes it. Of course, he's not sure about printing in China. But it's shipped here. It's less than 10 bucks a book.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.
01:07:35 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And looking into it. Yeah. I mean, unless I see a major red flag, I want to do it because like that's huge savings. Instant, you know, uh, and I'm.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So glad you started the doc because I feel like we'll get better traction this month, just being able to have some back and forth. But I would really, really like you to consider. And I'm sorry, my daughter came in to see how long and then she let the dog in and he wants to. I don't know how long it's been since you've paid attention to your time and done any time tracking, but it might be good to do a little inventory on where time is going. And especially for summer and maybe just every summer kind of do that although it's going to change with the kids but with that being a teacher, you know it's kind of a good idea to have an idea of how does your schedule change during the summer. And so go ahead and just kind of do a time inventory tracking little bit just it's going to be roughly don't have to do it perfect but just really just pay attention to your time. Where it's going, especially with having the different things going on with tea And that potentially creeping up a little bit, but probably having a good return Seeing what you might want to change in your devotion to it You might want to increase it if it gets out on clickbank and it's doing well I know they're the marketing guys, but you know get your brain on it and going you know what I know some stuff to you Let me put some of this on it put some gasoline on it cuz it's actually really doing good Um stuff you're doing with him potentially getting one more new client to get that extra $5,000 a month buffer But then also making sure you've got time to think about Potentially having conversations with junior copywriters, whatever. So really looking at it and kind of Choosing a pace for the summer choosing the the main goals for the summer what you'd like to accomplish and also in Goals for the family like family trips whatever stuff you guys want to do and just really kind of you know how we've done our time blocking like out in advance. I would love you to kind of try to like if you just spent a few days this week through next week looking at what would I like to get done throughout the summer put them in this spreadsheet with the weeks out right and put the big rocks in there right we're vacation all week not barely touching anything or boot camp whatever like really get the chunks down all through the rest of the summer and then show that to me so that I can look at it with you and just go okay here's some new thoughts about how to part of it will be about how do we how do we give Titans a container that you feel good about but also that you're like okay inside of this can't container I'm going to maximize everything and you get the best but when that containers full, then I get to go play in my other playgrounds, which I'm really enjoying, and you know, so that you don't feel this burden or any building resentment as a result of it, because that does happen. And if you put it into a specifically chosen container, that should reduce the ability and the likelihood of having resentment build up about it, because you've put it where you want it to be and what you're okay with.
01:11:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Make sense? Yep.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. So just because like we're already getting into July, and you know, that time goes really fast, especially with the kids, and I'm just getting older and faster and faster and faster, I would recommend scheduling out, you know, super rough draft, not major detail. The rest of your summer light that soon, and
01:12:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
and share it with me. OK, I'm in and knowing that. Sheet for myself. We packed a lot into in the May and June or the verification and.
01:12:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:12:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)

00:00:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's how I know There you go.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm all sassy on mute. And the word castrated came into my mind.
00:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let me open up my notes and see which one of my faces. Um, what's new this week? What's been going on in the business world?
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I Get ready moon here, okay Eric's gonna be happy about that. He doesn't know it yet, but he's about to know it Talk about weird late not weirdly not weird at all Tina let's face facts my life the the dude I Don't know where I found this guy, but he Frank guy. It's Frank. Yeah, I don't know where I don't know how I Managed to find Frank But I bought his course And I think I went through it Parts of it and then I gave it to Eric and Eric went through it now at the time. It wasn't really contextualized. It was like We didn't have stuff from here yet, so I don't think we'd actually Totally moved in the blocks direction, so it was Maybe a little premature or whatever, but I mean I definitely bought the course before moon year I think I could actually go with that up, but then Eric subsequently gave it to Amishik and DJ like two weeks ago And they started going through it went to them late and then I was like, okay, how do I? You know my thing, you know When I was around complain like oh my new you're so terrible like okay Well, do I how do I solve this and I was like I need someone Like we're 80 90% there I'm like I need someone that could come in and say do this do this do this and I don't even need them to write code because I ultimately To have Eric and Abishik and DJ or whatever to have those guys Write and maintain the code or at least maintain I finish it maybe whatever you want to call it I was like that's the ideal set up so then I found some dude that I don't know and I reached out to him And then I was like, I'm just gonna retuck Frank because I've asked him questions and he's always answered them and of course my other thought is why is no one else thinking of this but whatever so I reach out to Frank write him an email hey man we've got these developers he's like why was I ghosting us but it's completely like the projects on a basic standstill here's where we're at I need to finish it I've got these days and Frank writes me back and his emails like I absolutely do this I can do we can do it two ways we can do it hourly or you can take you can pay for the month and it will work like this we get on a phone call per week I'll do a code review each week make sure they're on track as a matter of fact I did this exact thing for this company and then he's like go check out their stuff and go check out this guy's testimonial and it wasn't even a testimonial which was great it was just a section of a podcast where the guy was getting interviewed and the podcast I started asking him about the development. He goes, oh, well, when it came time to develop this theme, had bought Frank's course and we contacted Frank. And he said, yeah, I can do this with you. And he guided us through, and our developers did it.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh my God, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
00:04:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the theme is so similar to basis in a way. And I'm like, yeah, okay, yeah, you've literally done this. Right. Like, this is great. So he wrote me back today and he's like, yeah, let's do it. I was like, yeah, dude, I'll pay you $1,500 a month. He's like, you said it would take six to eight weeks, depending how busy they are. He's like, yeah, I'll take number in the six to eight weeks. I was like, I love it.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have to keep him. You had a similar kind of beginning with Munir.
00:04:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, this guy is definitely different because he's got this course and he's constantly updating it. Like he's very on.
00:04:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is different.
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and he owns his own agency. Like this guy, he owns a well-known agency. Uh, I think he owns part owner of human design. Um, what? Yeah, I think that's, or does, yeah, I know the name of the agency.
00:05:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I definitely know it. Okay, you know, design is like a, anyagram kind of like thing.
00:05:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, um, it's something, it's something with human in it. I might not give any, it's, or it's designed by humans. It's one another. I don't know. But it's like a high-end agency. And so, but the difference is he's not going to write any code. He's not coding anything. He's just saying, you got to do this. You got to do that. He's like, I'll examine your repo. I'll make sure that all your processes are correct. How they can move forward to maintain the code base. All the things that they action. And I didn't tell him any of that. So, he was giving me stuff they, I've said that they need to get clear on. And he's like, Oh, no, yeah, no, I'll show him to do all of it. And it's exactly what he did for these other guys. And the other guy wouldn't shut up about how great it all came because they had never developed a block at all. They'd never done any block development whatsoever. They went through his course and they started and then they were like, Oh, we need more. We need to make sure that we're like, we need a Sherpa. And so I came in and shurpered them.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:06:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So I'm going get that role in here today, tomorrow.
00:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does Frank's course teach?
00:06:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Block theme develop block and block development.
00:06:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's definitely on different level of doer.
00:06:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's a teacher. like this dude said, he's the only, it's the only course I've that's, yeah, literally the only one I ever found, and that was, you know, over a year ago, and he's been on it from the beginning, like here. What's also so funny is he sent what the reason I reached out to him is because he sent an email the other day, like, I'm on the list of a buyer. And he pointed out this new feature, I was like, God damn, that sounds exactly like what we need. And then I send it to the guys and they're like, oh, yes, you can do this. That would be perfect. And I'm like, I'm sure we're not using that feature. So he's super duper. He's like up on things like Munir is, but maybe even more so. But the problem with Munir is like, he's just hosting. It's like he's writing the code. So it's like, it's his team. And then he's like, I'm not used to working in this type of scenario. I'm like, I'm pretty sure you suggested this. So why did you suggest that if you're not used to it, buddy?
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But whatever, this is, as the medium told me, Nia was not going to work out of don't trust him. Don't add him to the team. was like, I'm not going to, but I did think he was going to finish the project.
00:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was wrong in that regard. Yeah, I mean, it was so close. And yeah, it did not seem like it would go that way.
00:08:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It was so close until it wasn't.
00:08:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So then Eric, I just keep thinking about Eric and his bitterness, but then and then directed at Meneer. But maybe there is, I don't know. So what's the, what's the overall temperature on Eric this week?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They, those three seem to be getting on the same page about stuff.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:08:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
B.J. and Abhishek? Yeah. So they're like, all right, we're going to get all this. So he actually just ran a bunch of stuff by me. was like, yes, he has no, yes. Do it like this. And he's like, OK, perfect, yeah, that's a few. I guess they had a long meeting this morning. So like, and it's just getting things so that like it's very, everything's the same. Like, OK, they're all, it all looks like this. And all that when we build the site, we're going to add these steps up and every time. It's very technical stuff that we've discovered recently because all of these hacks and whatever. Right. And a lot of it's stuff that I was like, we should do this. But I'm saying it in Slack, right? then now they're, you know, Abishik's really good about like compiling everything and then saying, hey, so I guess they met and they're like, all right, this is our game plan, what we're going to do.
00:09:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so Frank, what is Frank doing that's different than what Eric and Abishik and me are going to do?
00:09:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They don't know how to code blocks. Oh, they don't really not not at all, but just like rank and be like, go here, take this path.
00:10:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, I thought most of the blocks were finished. So how much what blocks need to be finished, what, what is all the blocks are done.
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the main problem right now is the theme. So there's 11 tasks that I sent. So if you first think of it in two pieces, right, basis is essentially two pieces. It's the theme, the base theme, and then basis blocks 2.0 is the blocks plugin. all the issues that Abshek and Vijay are having around building a site are theme based. So they're like, hey, the theme doesn't do this. And then they go look at, they started looking at like 20, 24, which is WordPress's default theme, right? And it's a blocks theme. And they're like, if it's here. or then it could be in ours, we wanted in ours. And then it's that, it's all these like, I mean, I could get into the menu show, but just suffice it to say, it's like theme level code. on the blocks, then it's like, oh, there's a couple things about the blocks. Like one of the layout of such and such a block is off, whatever, but they're like, doesn't matter. It's less, there's less to do there, but what's really holding up like, building wolf reciting are theme related things.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, I thought Norio built the theme.
00:11:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nope.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cause I thought- He built the old one, but he has not been involved in the, so blocks require a block theme.
00:11:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. can't have, you can't have a classic theme.
00:11:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Norio built the He built the original basis theme and the child theme when you were like bootstrapping all that.
00:11:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. It's hard to like it's not like it's not that I can't comprehend a lot of it on the technical level It's that you have the conversation.
00:12:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So rarely like I can't remember And and I understand the details of it without asking some more questions and I wanted a little bit more about You were right. He did. He just did build this one. Okay, and like and the way things work now is like Completely different. That's why these guys are like how do we do this and Frank will be like It's here.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know because you started it and then they built out a Gutenberg and you're like but the Everything but but that's the thing everything changes and it constantly changes. So but what won't change is that um and this is this is like I don't know how to say it, but I almost feel like it's more like at a spiritual level Now that I'm thinking about it What won't change is that very is this oppositional force to clarity and to truth, right? If you can think about it, there's always opposition to clarity and truth. So there's opposition to good and clarity and truth are part of that, which so I'm just, I'm Tina braining right now, which is really weird. I hear myself, I know I sound weird, but it's a thought that I just had, because I was thinking about, you know, things evolved, you would think that clear analytics would be part of the evolution, but my brain instantly was like, well, no, it won't be because there's opposition to truth and clarity, because that causes confusion and there's definitely, you know, this force that wants confusion and anyway, that was just weird. But yeah, so you will be always be needed, because by default, I think there will never be something that is very clear that helps people have clear data, clear understanding of their business, because that makes them powerful, right? You can't know what levers are the right levers if you don't understand what they are, what they do, the impact that they make, aka data, analytics. So regardless of how much WordPress itself changes, and the themes change, and the technology, and the underlying foundational basis of them changes, I don't think there's ever going to be anything that is by default does anything like what you do for the purpose of the things that you do, which is, you know, fast, reliable site, but also clear, valuable, usable data, and easily created websites that give all of that, that, that, that make it possible to have all of that. Anyway, so I was just wondering the whole path that how long it's taken, but I guess what was the original motivator and it sucks because like if we could just do osmosis and like relay thoughts instantly, that would be so different because it takes like 10 minutes to explain something that passes through my brain almost instantaneously and simultaneously, but that like it's wild that it's taken this long to be working on this and the fear is that technology could evolve and you have done all of this and then become obsolete, but all of that that I just said was my brain's argument that happened instantaneously that you're not going to be obsolete because of the data component because of the clear, because of the simplicity, because of the reliability and all of that. Nobody does that on a massive, level, aka like WordPress, right? Or most of the other big things, because that isn't their primary goal, like that's your ML right there. Fast, clear, easy, reliable. Anyway.

Yeah, and it's the, you know, if all these things are moving to like fractional this and fractional that, it's like you can outsource this whole thing to one place and be done.
00:16:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If Dan sells it. Yeah.
00:16:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's they mean.
00:16:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll sell it first.
00:16:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'll sell it when it's ready, but come on. But seeing what he did with these other guys, I'm like, oh my god, that's so close, except I looked at their stuff and I'm like, ours is better. Because they're, they're building it as an agency. So they're building for their thing. And I'm like, well, we're building it for someone to run their business on and stuff like that. Well, you're Frank going and then hopefully it'll be in six to eight weeks and weirdly that's exactly what the medium said.
00:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so when did you go see a medium like the most recently?
00:17:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I didn't tell you that.
00:17:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, seen two.
00:17:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've seen two.
00:17:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The one was with my mom is the one that we've seen forever. hmm. The ball was the one that was like, there's someone on your team that you can't trust. And she's like, uh, and do not keep this person around. I don't want you to keep this person around and go, well, I know who you're talking about. I don't plan on keeping them around. And she's like, it's not a bad person, but you can't, you can't rely on them. And I was like, that's so weird that she would say that. But I knew exactly who it was. And then so I like, Oh, yeah, I know the plan is to, you know, not keep more. like I'm telling you don't. I go okay um so then we can dinkly. He's he's out. Yeah and then I met with a different I met with like a medium psychic channeler yesterday and uh that Molly turned me on to some Molly um and Molly's been you know Molly is like this uh woman that I worked with here.
00:18:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's the first person I met years ago um was she the like which one lady?
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah she's the one that calls me which yeah okay so when you like I said that I was placing my hands together pressing my hands together because I was thinking about that story yeah yeah anyway okay I'm making her bring the right thing yeah so she recently resurfaced and seen her in a while and so she's come here a couple times the office and you the studio for stuff. And so she was telling me one day she was here. She's like, Oh, I gotta introduce you to Carissa. Like Carissa's that she's next level blah blah blah blah. And I was like, okay, she's like, you love it. I got you know me. I'll try it. So she reached out to Carissa and was like, Hey, this is my friend Dan and it'll be great if you could do a reading with him or whatever. And then her assistant wrote back like, Oh, Carissa's booked up for like 18 months. There's no there's no whatever like we can put him on the wait list or whatever. And yeah, yeah, got it. It was like, Oh, okay. And Molly's like, Oh, well, I mean, you're on the wait list or whatever. And I go, okay, whatever. And then maybe a couple weeks later, this person woman emails me and it's like, Hey, I've got I've neat with you. And I was like, Oh, okay. And then we kind of went back and forth and figured out a date. then I hit up Molly. I was like, Hey, Carissa reached out to me and set up a date. going to meet with her. I'm talking to each other. Oh, I can't wait to get her. Okay. So then in the interim, because this is months ago, like I was booked months in advance. And then in the interim, Molly went to one of her journeys, like they go to Sedona and go out in the desert or whatever, right? So when she was at the journey, she pulled Carissa to the side and was like, Hey, why, why did you like, I talked to Dan, you're doing a call with him. Like, I thought you were booked for 18 months. Like, why, how, what's going on? And she said, Oh, well, I reached out to him energetically. And she's like, I have to talk to this guy. He's like, his energy is crazy.
00:20:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Molly's like, Oh, wait.
00:20:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just wait till you talk to him. And I was like, oh, that's so funny. And then then the call got screwed up because she got sick and then I started thinking I'm not going to do this call I was like weirded out by it for some reason. I was like, I don't think I should talk to this person. Like, I don't know. There's so I'm like, I was like borderline scared. Okay, I do this. So I did for like three weeks and then I was walking home the other day and I was like, no, just do it. Like the fact that you don't want to do it means you should do it. So I emailed and I was like, and she had sent the dates. I'm like, let's do this date, which is yesterday. So then we, right when we get on the call, it was like, I just need to tell you a couple of days up front. She was like, so what she had said was when I agreed to the call the first time, she goes, okay, the reading starts now. So I'm going to be meditating on you and reaching out to you and you can do the same to me. Like if you want to open yourself up and allow. Allow yourself to reach out to me. You can or whatever. I was like, okay, like what the are you talking about? Okay, sure So she's like three starts now, but so don't know a couple weeks and then I said that to Molly. She's like, oh, yeah, Like you can you can and I know I don't I don't I'm out. How would I even do that? So a couple weeks into it Like I don't and Molly was like, yeah, you can reach out to her in your dreams And I was like sure I Do not remember my dreams like ever. It's very rare to remember them, but One night I have this dream like weeks after this stuff's been booked I'm not really thinking about it at all But I have this dream and a woman is in my dreams and it's a face and I don't know who it is Like I don't know who that is and then I woke up the next day and I was like that was weird Like, I don't recognize that. I was just weird. I just remember thinking, oh, that's weird. And then I you not. A couple of days later, I go, wait a second. What does this person look like? I don't even know what this woman looks like. So the woman in my dream was like, 40s, maybe 50s, like strawberry blonde hair, there is . I look out this woman. That's exactly what she has. And I was like, that's so weird. That is so weird. I'm like, I wonder if that's okay. And then a couple weeks later, a couple weeks before now, four or like three weeks ago, I had this dream where a guy was in my dreams and it looked like my uncle. But I was like, I'm not sure that's him. But I thought, oh no, that's Jack. That's my uncle, Jack, who's alive. And then... And I remember waking up the next day and I was like, Oh, like, am I having one of those things where the person is Dan, and they came together. So I go online, looking to see if they want to get news. Like, I text my mom, like, have you heard anything about Jack lately? He's like, Oh, he's fine. Well, okay, whatever. So I got in the call with her yesterday and up front, she's going, I got to tell you some stuff. And she's like, your energy is crazy. And she's like, I have every time I reached out to you through meditation, she's like, you shifted. You've shifted again, you shifted again, you shifted again. She's like, it's not normal. She's like, you're, she's like, you're on this journey. And you've been on it for like the last four years. She's like, I don't even want to talk about what you did before because you did stuff before. We're not going to talk about it. We're going talk about the last four years. But she's like, just these last nine months, you've, you've made this thing and you're shifting. When every time I tap into you, you shift. You should get like a master's class in like spiritual journey, because you're doing things at such a fast pace. It's like nothing I've ever seen. I was like, oh, okay. And she's like, to give you an idea, when I normally do one of these readings, I come into the reading with one or two pages of notes. She's like, I have nine pages of notes sitting in front of me right now. So she's like, I'm just going to go. It's going to go fast because I want to cover all of this. And she's like, so just be prepared. That was like, okay. And then she just opened this fire hose and started going. And the accuracy was off the charts, right? So I was like, okay. Now, what I didn't tell her was before we got in the call, I never said this. I never told anybody this that what I've been wondering for years. I know that I have two guides. know it. I know there's two people. I don't know who it is. I feel like they're family members, right? I just know that they're there. So we eventually get into the call. And I don't know where she goes. You have a very strong connection with your guide.
00:26:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's two of them.
00:26:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Now, I've always wondered who they are. So all of a sudden she goes, she switches into. She's like, I'm going to, and she said this might happen. She's like, at some point I might just switch into medium. And she goes, okay, I'm switching, right? There's a bunch of people here that want to talk to you, that are waiting to like interact. I go, okay. So the first thing she says is, I just hear piano music. Somebody is playing piano. It's beautiful. And this is a gift that they had. And they're like, but it's a gift that they got from their father. So it's my grandfather. I know that's he played piano, but what I didn't know was that his dad played piano. So I like, okay, she's talking about my grandfather, I think. I don't know that he played piano. So I like, no, to self, ask my mom. And then she goes, there's another guy here, and she's like, this is one of your guides. I you not, Tina. The second she said that, the name Joe popped into my head. And she goes, it's a J name. And then in unison, we both said, Joe. She goes, she goes, whoa. I want to come back to that. I go, okay, goes, okay. yeah, Joe, and she starts talking about him. And I'm like, this is either my uncle or my grandfather. And I thought it was my uncle, but she's saying stuff. And I'm like, sounds, I don't know. So she says all this stuff. she's like, Joe has been with you. I'll watch is over you Joe how Joe's life did not turn out the way he thought it was going to and she goes into all this detail I'm like that's grandfather and then she says some other stuff. I'm like that's uncle So I think she didn't realize that they had the same name and they were kind of crossing back and forth But then she's like Joe Watches over the girl with an a name He's very he's very watchful of her and I was like what the Like wow She's like who's that who is that? It was it was wild. It was wild some of stuff that she was saying But then she goes she goes okay. I want to stop How did you know it was Joe and I got I didn't it just the name popped into my head before you said it She's like seriously. go. Yeah, it's like dude. That's crazy. I'm like you're the medium What are you talking about?
00:28:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have to tell you something because I So my spirituality obviously is religious specifically.
00:29:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so's hers. That was the other weird thing.
00:29:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to tell you this because this is this is where it's me. This is your dime, by the way, we're talking about all of this. Normally, I am very resistant to so the scriptures talk about beware of sous sayers, things like that, basically that really don't engage with mediums and whatnot. Okay, but here's, I'll tell you this, I approach the scriptures very differently because I feel like that there's there's a spectrum of people and obedience and understanding and spiritual strength and powers and whatnot. And I think that the majority of commandments are given for basically the average person, right? This is the guidelines that they need. And I believe that there is room for exploration and that people with higher level spirituality will be able to discern where the difference, I guess, between the letter of a law and the spirit of the law and discern between good and bad and be able to actually figure these things out for themselves rather than just to be like, okay, three-year-old boy, these are the boundaries, don't go outside of that because if you do, it'll be dangerous. But really, it is dangerous, but also, there's so much more to explore. You're just not equipped to be able to handle the danger, so I want you to stay inside here. Whereas other people are equipped to handle the danger and equipped to do the exploration and equipped to learn and to expand perpetually, which is where I fall. You fall. So, and I've had experiences with, like, Ouija board and it won't let me play with that by myself because it literally just moves my hand off the board because I don't want to talk to dark spirits and I believe that dark spirits can do whatever they want to they can lie and that good spirits can't but that good spirits also have to obey certain rules and act in a certain way and one of my biggest the only indicator I ever have that I trust what's the word like always always always always trust is peace because Jesus Christ is the prince of peace like that's the only whether people believe in him or not is irrelevant to me but that that he and God that that is the only emotion that Satan or any kind of darkness can't replicate they can replicate everything else pleasure excitement tell the truth mixed with lies you know a little bit here little bit there because They don't do good, but they can look like they're doing good. When you were talking, my original, you know, my normal, I would say kind of walls, but it's more like a discerning net, I guess, is my discerning antenna, not net, because I like to be open and receive things so that I can learn always and try to catch myself in judgment so that I'm not judging things that incorrectly. What was interesting to me, especially when you got to Joe, first of all, it was the absence of negative feelings and anxiety, which I often feel around many medium conversations, because I think there's a lot that just aren't great, but that wasn't there. So I noticed that that wasn't there, but what surprised me was this feeling. And that I'm very, very much recognized and identify with being God related, a piece of warmth, from head to toe, and wanting to cry, which is also that like manifestation that that comes with it. And that really surprised me, it made me think I want to talk to her. I'm always like avoiding, I'm like, I will, I'm not going to do things God does not want me to do. I just applied, did I tell you that I would be a missionary? No, I'm going to do a genealogy missionary mission.
00:33:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm super excited about it.
00:33:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she's like, you're not actually the youngest one. She goes, we have people in their 20s. She goes, but they're autistic. I was like, Oh, other than the autistic on there, the youngest ones are being it's called the senior mission. But we'll have devotionals on Wednesdays. And I've committed 12 hours a week to just genealogy work for the church. And that's we do that for so that we can do tempo work for the dead so that people that didn't have an opportunity to be baptized, to see baptism and things like that. Anyway, so that was just this whole thing. It was just wild to me. And of course she felt your energy, like, I was just thinking she's like, you're not normal.
00:34:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's Dan everywhere in his life.
00:34:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you know, it really crazy.
00:34:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Some of the that she said, I was like, there's no way, there's no way you could never know this. So she was like, hey, I just want to let you know that like, she's like, you have a great heart. But she's like, you're a kiddie. You have two Achilles heels. Oh, I go, okay. And she's like, your first, your first one is, you help too much. And I was like, get the out.
00:34:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How could you?
00:34:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Tina has told you that too. No, I know, but I was like, how could a stranger? Right. know that. And she's like, let me, let me explain what I mean by it. And then she goes into the explanation. I was like, yeah, I'm like, she nailed it. And I was like, yeah, I've recently come to realize that that my help is not helping. And she just laughed. She goes, Oh my God, that is so perfect. Yes, your health doesn't help because she's like, they're advocating responsibilities and putting them on you. And it's not your responsibility. And she's like, you need that you need to stop doing that.
00:35:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, you have no idea.
00:35:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She goes, at one point, she goes, she's like, the biggest word on this page of notes, she's like, I'm nine pages, but the biggest word and all this is the word space. So she's like, you've been creating space, you need to keep creating it. I go, there's one, there's one left. Like, there's one left. And she goes, what do you mean? I go, there's one of those advocating, whatever relationship. And I told her a little bit about how I figured all this stuff out.
00:36:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She knows. Oh, yeah, you need they need to go Are you talking about Eric?
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, um woofer They need to go and I was I forget what the other one was. She sent the call. I gotta listen to it again It was like two hours or some , but Now here's so much more now, man Here's the trippy here's the trippy part that she obviously couldn't have known or doesn't know And I went to the other medium right Paula who I've known for like 20 years At the end of the thing Paula goes is there anything else you want to ask me I go. Yeah I'm supposed to meet with this medium who's like a Channeler bop up by explaining to her and she goes, okay, let me let me, you know, let's look at that All right, great. So Paula like does her thing and she goes, okay She's going to tell you that she can't help you go any further. And I was like, okay, she's like, that's it. She can't help you go any further. I was like, okay, but I Molly that, Molly instantly goes, oh no, that is not how Carissa works. That's not what that will not happen. It was a thousand percent happened. She was like, at the end of the call, she goes, I have nothing for you. Wow. She's like, that never happens to you. I'm going to give you a couple of things, but she's like, you're organically doing these things. Yep. And you're fine. And she's like, and by next year, she's like, next year, you're going to have the biggest shifts in your life. And it's all the work you've been doing is leading up to 2025. She's like, 2025 is going to be a huge year for you on all. from, but she's like, I don't, you could, I could offer you to come to one of my sessions, and you're welcome to, but she's like, honest with God, you don't need it. You don't need anything. And I was like, oh my God, it really wouldn't been other person said.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, this is trippy. Yeah, but it doesn't surprise me though, because if there is anybody that is, and I say if, because I feel like I have strong intuitive powers, which is why really early on all say things to people that I really don't have a foundation for saying. I don't really have enough knowledge to say it, but I know it. And a lot of that is psychological profiling, but that's definitely not all of it. There's a good portion of intuition. But also I've been watching you and you, you, I think the, like you have a level of knowing about yourself, but you, you fight it anyway.
00:39:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. told her that.
00:39:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
totally admitted that.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I feel like that actually is the biggest shift that you've made, but the momentum of that it has rapidly increased in the last year and a half or so. And I'm not sure if there was a thing that happened or a trigger or you just arrived at a tipping point. Maybe I had something to do with the age of the girls too. was like, because being a parent changes you and raising people changes you. As you watch them, you start to re-evaluate your childhood because you can now see it from a parent side and go, okay, I have these experience and those feelings and now you just kind of see them differently or it re-validates things. But either way, you have a new level of knowing, just raising children, and that will change you. Anyway, regardless, your level of knowing and confidence and first of all, installing, but then enforcing boundaries and shrinking them a little bit. So like when I met you, there was all kinds of people in dance and or something that didn't belong there. And you, so that shrinking right first started happening, that just pushing people out. But at the same time, I think the, like imagine the boundary of being a physical wall, the density of that boundary also increased. And it's like, I don't know, however you want to visualize it. That's what's fortifying. like you're the certainty of you belong, you don't belong and here's why and it doesn't matter if you agree with that or don't agree with that and also your understanding of the cost for so like solving people's puzzles you're like oh well I learned this and I learned this and I accept the cost of that but I think that your value of what price you're willing to pay for learning has also shifted a little bit and then anyway all of those things are just kind of converging I guess would be the word and her hurt so I the funny thing is I didn't look into her that much right I was but then on the phone I was like oh she's like definitely like very Catholic I would say so at one point she was like you oh my god this keeps happening to Tina I don't know what else go
00:42:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of this, but she's like, you are surrounded by symbols of Christ. She's like, you're surrounded by them. And she's like, you're like, there are, she's like, I'm seeing nuns and priests and churches. She's like, you're, you're surrounded by it. She's like, you're very, like, you're very connected to the Archangel Michael. She's like, you're very connected to that. But her explanation of like the journey that people go on. She's like, he compared it to Christ's journey in that like, but it's people's individual journey. She's like, there's a death of self. And then you, then you go into the tomb, and she's like, the tomb is almost like, she's like, if you think about it like this, Jesus was reborn almost as if he came out of a womb. It was the tomb, the rock rolled away, he emerged. she's like, and then he's reborn as his spirit self. She's like, that's the journey You can take not like him, but that those three steps and she's like right now you're in the womb So it's so funny that you're like you're fortified you're surrounded. I'm like, oh, that's weird Or like what she said So did I did I build a tune?
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and my faith believes that he was resurrected resurrected like with a physical body and that we were all spirits before we came here and that we receive our bodies and that we will be resurrected and we see them back again, but they will be changed and unable to die unable to be corrupted and What we know about science that makes perfect sense to me that there's the ability to figure that out, you know Anyway, it's all fascinating to me, but yeah, yeah, so We spent so much time on that. really want to know that I mean, I don't regret that. I just want to make sure that we also do But it's anyway, it's part of journey we do that we do Mercer's course. Yeah, yes, yes. But this is the thing, though, is that I've really been able to I've been leaning more into the whole list approach because the business is nothing without the solidity of the CEO behind it, the visionary behind it, the the person and all of those values. Like I think about Mark, I think about everyone's evolution that I've ever worked with. And the biggest transformation happened with the person, then then their business, the business had a correlating transformation. But 100% every time the person had the bigger transformation. Like when you think about who you work with, how much time has been working with them, the way that you handle them, but also like your sleep, your hormone health, your physical health, I did I'm not the one that did all of that, but you've been on this journey, we discuss it, and then you go and do different things. But just being an assistant or facilitator or whatever it is to that process, and knowing that the systems, the teams, all those processes are critical, they're the simplest part of it. They're really easy to do. The first thing is kind of editing, modifying the person that's running it so that their prime is to be able to understand the power, the need for not only creating the infrastructure, you know, in the particular way, in the logical way, which to me also is part of my mission. What I don't to out of people's lives. I feel like that's kind of preparing them for when they're ready to talk to God, when they're ready to have him in their life, because they now recognize people that lie. They now recognize chaos. They now recognize darkness a little bit differently. And that's not the conversations we have, but it happens. They become happier people, but they put more order in their lives. They put more goodness in their lives. They put more integrity in their lives and in their business. Anyway, it's just been wild. The things that you happen, you're like, it's wild, but of course, I've been having so much of that, the people that marks into me. I was just like, I want different clients. And I was like, do you have anybody? And then he sent me somebody and that guy was awesome. And then there's, he's talking about another person that as I'm working with the new doctor and just, Working on the mission talking to you all the things that you're going through. I'm just like it's just it just keeps getting better Faster, but also like right Darker on the other side. You know what I mean? Like the polarity. It's wild. Anyway, okay. Yes. Marshall Mercer Mercer Where are we happening? Huh?
00:47:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's happening. just got it's long Yeah, like there there's like it's not a course. It's like five. Oh Go through. Yeah. Yeah, finished one.
00:47:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, that the like the cave the whatever Is that what you were calling five or like what?
00:47:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no Framework So it's like framework then GA for itself then Measurement and reporting plan So like his whole thing is really you learn the framework and then you do the plan and the plan, I'm forgetting a step, a plan something and then the launch or plan to launch something, there's three steps. So but in each of those steps, you have to, the first step of planning in the cave is GA4. So you got to go learn GA4, right? So you go through the whole framework and it's like, okay, this is the overarching 30,000 for view. Now go set up, go learn GA4 real quick and then set up the basic GA4 and then you're going to go set up your reporting and forecasting and then you're going to set up whatever you're going to do the cave version of all those. So you're going to do those steps three times, then you're going to go back and you're going to redo the plan from the valley. So you're going plan again, that might be where you're out in GTN. I'm going to to go through all of them because I'm not in the cave in some respects. I'm in the Summit in other respect, right? So I'm all over the place So I have to go through all of them, and I'm sure there's little nuances like There's probably stuff in that a I don't need GA for it all right? So there's probably stuff in GA for I mean, I really don't know it, right? It's like I don't know But there's probably little said you say you don't need it or you don't know it know it know it Oh, cuz I thought you said you don't need it at all So it sounds like you're you'll do like the foundation the framework of everything then GA for then like this measurement and forecasting thing and Then something else and then you go back and they'd be like oh you want now you want to do custom Okay, Now you're gonna do GTM So there's at least four or five So I'm on two. I'm on the second one.
00:50:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, that's a lot.
00:50:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's a lot. But and here's the thing. like, who's going to do this? No one. But once you do it, and then it's available to everyone.
00:50:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I love that though. Okay, so at this point, so last week, you told Lynn probably like another week or so or something. What are you thinking now?
00:50:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, I didn't say a week.
00:50:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my God.
00:50:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I can probably get it done in that period of time.
00:50:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just feel like it's a momentum kind of thing that it's and keeping everything fresh because of the technical nuance of it that. But then again, there's that whole kind of subconscious distilling that happens when you're like, your brain is working it out. when you're not like, oh, I could do this. Or, oh, I need do this. Or it just kind of makes more sense kind of thing. Oh, anyway. And I also know that it's not a, I kind of refer to myself sometimes as having full energy, which is just like, I'm going to plow through. And also knowing that that really never works out well for me. That doesn't work best. But anyway, OK, how is another 71 doing? Like, what have you observed anything? Any changes? Any ahaas this week?
00:51:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, other than like the sales during 4th of July were higher than expected, higher than the last 2th of July. So it was like, oh, we can really get a dip, which is weird. But we got a bunch But it's on point with the other surge that was already.
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
already happening, right?
00:52:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, so that would have ended on the 25th. So, and we did get a huge spike in cancels around that date. Like I'm so visually obvious.
00:52:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, Oh, that looks weird.
00:52:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it was to be expected. So then that had us lose some subscribers. That that was week prior. Then this week we gained subscribers, but then the daily average was still 32. So I was like, okay. But if that makes sense, then we're in the high season. But what didn't make sense is that it was better than the last two for the July's. But not like crazy, Tom.
00:52:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, and did you have any new thoughts or feelings around the ceiling?
00:52:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, we're gonna hit it. It's unavoidable. Yeah, we're getting close. I think we're at 4060. So I had estimated that hitting at 155 days, around June 20th, I figured that out. So by August, I think, August, September, we should hit it. And that'll be also when sales start to dip again. So then we'll probably... So there's a chance you could go over it. That's the problem. It's like, yeah, we could go over it in this quarter. But when you zoom out at the end of the year, it's going to end up being that you hit it. Once you hit it, you're going to be in and around that number from that day forward. So if we hit it, we could hit it and exceed it in September or August. But when things slow down and we go back down to a 22-day average, we're averaging 32 now. you're going to go over, but your sales are going to naturally cycle down and keep 2, 3, Q4 to the 22. And if you're already out, that's if you're over the ceiling, it's going to come down to 490, but it won't go way below it. So that explains how in the past, we saw like, oh, we had like 4,500 subscribers, but that was like a peak that lasted three weeks, right?
00:54:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And we just weren't looking at in the context of, oh, when you zoom out, it's all the same, same, same, same, same, So I have notes for, and this was a couple of weeks ago that we talked about it, the conversion rates and the purchase path for the 2-path page. Oh, my dog.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hold on.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Thank you. for the 2-path page to determine which path has higher conversions and where to optimize. so yeah so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna do any of that stuff until I go through mercy yeah yeah because that's part of his thing is like why would you even do that like why would you do why would you do that in the context of not really knowing what's happening right which is what I've done forever right what the heck is that oh my gosh I just copy paste and it did percentage MCE paste bin percentage I feel like I'm gonna end up being tech support in my mission I I have I mean I spent six years in the tech support community and a call center and didn't do it the whole time I'm mostly managed but Yeah, it's okay. But also because it's like search stuff and mission, like I feel different about it. It's not like I have to do it, you know what I mean?
00:56:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That makes it different. And they have to have some level of skill to even be able to do it, so there's stuff. Let's see, it's turning extent of customer confusion about ninja being the supplement versus the full course. Reach out to Delphi AI. Oh, that's the Joe thing.
00:56:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, we did that. Yeah. We built a ninja bot. It works really well. It works really well. The Bobby's been working on that a bunch. We're actually just subscribed. We're like, screw it.
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a little bit more about that, like what it does and how it's doing.
00:56:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're basically building an agent.
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
right?
00:57:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like you can't inject it to before, but they must add some layer on it that helps it. I mean, they're not. It's not like they have their own LL and they're tapping into checking the TV line.
00:57:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Oh, so I did ask this, but I like, or maybe I thought about asking it that we were deep in the whole medium conversation, but just Eric. Oh, I was asking, so you said, hey, I'm B.J. and Avishik or on the same page with stuff, but like, well, something I noticed on the call this week, which is not, I was trying to figure out like how you're reading Eric and his attitude. And I was like, trying to pay attention to him, and I remember him feeling this way before when I was first working with him. him and he got annoyed with me and mad at me. And it was it's because he's very subtle about it.
00:58:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's full of passive aggressive.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but if video is so acid. Well, hold on. I want to explain what I what I felt when I was listening to the call, which is this and but he's so mild in all of it, but it's almost like this annoyance and like I don't know anything like he's like I don't know. And like it's really when I was listening, I was listening carefully. I'm like, if you didn't know Eric, you'd never know that there's an issue. It's not overt in any kind of very sunny, very sunny.
00:58:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Yeah. It's very there's a the facade is like sunny, happy, helpful, but it but then you listen to the words and sometimes the delivery like Yeah, he's he's
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because was just very like, yeah, yeah, and it's really, I would have no way to be able to compel anybody to believe or understand that there's an issue if I, you know, wanted to. Yeah, which is just so interesting because that type of personality can really make you question what you think you're feeling, or you know what I mean, because it's so passive. Right. But I would imagine that that creates its own level of conflict, because like, do you just say what you actually think and how you actually feel?
00:59:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I mean, I think I have to do like, I can pick it up via a slack message. Like, I know what it looks, see it. Yeah.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here we go.
00:59:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, but it seems to have lessened for sure. Well, that's good. Do you think it's because Moneer's gone or less interaction with Givar?
01:00:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, do you have any? any idea why? Oh, you might have hit on it right there. Yeah, he's gone. He's got some health issues, so that are sidelined him for weeks. So the vipers out of the building, right? Well, it's like the yeah, the toxic sort of you just made me think like something you said made me think like what like he sits around stews on things and I'm like really that's your problem. Like don't sit around and stew on it. Like redirect that energy into something else. Like go put on a fricking book or some . How's he? But I think when it's compounded when it's you have this soundboard for lack of a better term. Oh, yeah. Exactly.
01:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not a soundboard.
01:00:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's an echo chamber.
01:00:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a it's from this negative energy.
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, whatever, ultimately though, you, you, here's the thing, here's the trap with people like that is because they're so passive and so subtle. And because it waxes and wanes, we increase our level of tolerance for it, but it doesn't decrease the cost to us. So, and you've been working with them long enough to know that at the end of the day, the evolution, I mean, it's not consistent. His cycle is consistent. Growth is not like, because I have a mom like this. She appears to grow and have cycles of growth. But, and I wish that I could show this to you, but imagine me drawing spiral circles, but my hand keeps raising up. So, I'm drawing them, like do it with your own hand, make a circle, but then raise your hand a little bit, make another circle, and raise your hand a little bit, make another circle. So, even though you're coming back down, your low is higher each time. To me that's growth, like you go up, you go down, you go up, you go down, but every time you go down, you don't go as low as you did the last time, that's perpetual growth. So, up and down, and down, the lows are different.
01:02:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Eric. what? Like Bitcoin.
01:02:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, totally. gotcha. Eric, on the other hand, they're like my mom, like the lows, they go right back to center.
01:02:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. Totally.
01:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
same. And those are the people I've learned, like I, I don't cut them off, like I'm never going to cut my mom off. Um, but I, and I'm never going to stop. trying, but the level of effort that I put into it and the level of hope I have and the level of energy I allow her to use of mine is fixing determined and will not increase unless she changes that habit that knowing that you know she's 67 years old she's not like really change that habit. You've been working with Eric as long as we've been working together basically so at least seven years and he he comes back down to the same place that we were at seven years ago, six years ago. However long it was when we first started talking to him together and I was able to observe him and that is massively telling like your night and day difference. I've evolved so much more since then. Right. has evolved so much since then. Stacy has evolved and I wouldn't even tell you the only problem I would have was Stacy as her
01:04:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
confidence in being able to go out there.
01:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, but she's grown. And she's diedily grown and improved. So, but Eric has come all the way back to that same place.
01:04:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that and always does.
01:04:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So, but you're letting that in in your your realm. And here's the thing that I told you many, many, many, many, many times. And I don't think that you believe me. Is that that takes a bigger toll on you than I think that you're aware of. Because you tell yourself it doesn't bother.
01:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But well, it doesn't. And it's not even relevant because we'll go back to the medium really quick. Okay. said she can't, this was out. Sorry. This was hilarious. So at one point, she goes off in this tangent, she's like, you really need to focus on like, or, you know, you got to get this foundation. right, right? If the foundation is right, then you can, you know, you don't want to build on sand. So once you get this foundation right and it's, and it's rock solid, then you're going to be able to build on this. So I'm like, uh-huh, that's real basis, right? And then she goes, and when you're working on this stuff, this blew my mind. So I like, oh my god, did I do this on purpose? I never thought about this before. She's like, you're going to get these things and they're just going to start to flow, right? The thing is just going to flow. Everything's going to say, she kept saying the word flow, flow, flow. Like, I know I'm like, oh my god, all of them are flow. All of them have the name flow. And I was like, I never thought about that. And then she goes, hey, come the fall. He said something about like between this time period, she's like, hey, want you to go on a trip, just go somewhere, not like international. She's like, just take time, go somewhere. And she's like, but at that, that's the period in time where she's like, You need to have some conversations and you need to have, you need to lay down and make clear exactly what is going to happen. All the eyes dotted, all the teas crossed, get these agreements in place. She's like, I don't know if they're agreements or contracts or what they are, but she's like, you've already been renegotiating with people and you're going to have to do that one more time in the fall. And she's like, I just want you to be super, super clear and get exactly, get it all out and get it exactly down. So she's like, transparency is like your biggest friend, you're a very transparent person. She's like, you just got to get that down. I'm like, oh my God, she's talking about all the conversations I'm planning on having. I'm like, And I was like, that's so weird. But so tied into what you were just saying is like, I still need to do that. And I'm going to do it. And it's like, and she's like, if you do that, then you're set, you're all set. I mean, I'm 100% positive. There's zero doubt in my mind. Like, there's not even a shade of doubt that we will sell Ninja in two or three years, period, it's going to happen. And I'm working, that is my plan, and it's not going to change. And it's whether or not this stuff works. Like, yes, I want it to work. But if it doesn't, oh, well, I've done what I wanted to do. but I'm going to make it clear. Like, Hey, know, it's time it's, I sent this to Denise yesterday, or this morning. I was like, their choice is going to be you either go get a job at 53, good luck. That's going to be a joy. Or you figure out how to make this thing, you don't. would treat this like a job anymore. Right. Right. And it's it's it's either or like it's up to you. So and that applies to all of them.
01:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:08:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we'll see.
01:08:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You will see.
01:08:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
My job is to get the damn code done. That's it. That's my job. And Frank, I'm to do it.
01:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am excited to see what but you know the cautiously optimistic but I'm always down for the journey though because it doesn't matter every time I look back. I'm like, wow, you know, like imagine being on on a mountain and then looking back at all the mountains you've already climbed. Like to me, it's always like that. never look back and go where I've barely moved or I've gone backwards. It doesn't matter what didn't go right, what's not what I planned on. I can always look back and go, wow, every single day. And I think that's pretty cool. I think you do that too. Whether you do the looking back and think that or not, I think that you are always moving forward and evolving. like, if you were to stop back, I really have to say, stop saying and I'm like, but anyway, if you think.
01:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I've got some of those.
01:09:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but if you stop and did look back intentionally and just evaluate where you've come from every time, if I were you, I'd be like, Wow, yeah, that's pretty cool.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I think what's interesting is like, I don't really have a destination, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think there is a destination. That's the why. That's the why stuff everybody thinks is even, even like Christians and getting to heaven, I'm like, do you really think? there's there anything that suggests, evidentially, evidentially, whatever. Evidently, right, that there is like, where you just, You get to heaven and you just relax and sing songs to Jesus all day long. like, does his life indicate that sitting around being saying to you is something he would like? Like the universe is continually expanding exponentially every single day. There is constant growth every single day and evolution, like you think at some point that's just gonna stop and we're all gonna rest and relax and like that's forever. Like that makes no sense.
01:10:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So to me there is no end point.
01:10:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There might be destinations on a journey and plots on a course, but there is no end destination. There's a final destination. There is just continual evolution and growth.
01:10:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so weird that you say that. So I, someone gave me this book like two years ago and the book is, hey, you're supposed to open up the book every day and then there's like, I don't know if it's a quote or it's just a phrase. There's a phrase on my... one page and then there's like two other not necessarily connected but they go together right they don't necessarily go together they go together and that they're on opposite pages but the one that I opened up to this week and then they're like and then just read it every day and think about it the one I opened up this week is that the goals are just stops on your journey and I was like that's interesting I never thought about it like that like or or your yeah it was something like that I'll send it you I was like that's an interesting I never thought about it like that but that it seemed very applicable to me because I'm like I know they're not the destination the goal is not the destination to me it's like yeah so like I've always said I don't have goals I just go I want to go to I want to have these destinations but it's in a greater journey I guess like I don't know yeah well or some goals or whatever whatever you call them plots on course but yeah I mean That's it. It's like the dot.
01:12:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, I'm going to go there.
01:12:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's like, some people would call that a goal and I'm like, well, I don't really call it a goal. It's like, I just want to get there. But that's not where I stop.
01:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the other thing, though, is that I think a lot of us get really attached to language, where a lot of times we're saying the same things, but we're using different words. And the meaning behind those words is what's more important. And you have cultures where the words were drawn. You have, you know, people that communicate energetically, those words aren't even spoken. So, but you can feel it. And there's alignment. And when you do use the words, you're like, yeah, now I've heard the words, you know, that that's true, but I already felt it. Like, I already felt that I didn't have words for it anyway. So, yeah. Just fascinating. No, no ends, destination and continual growth, which also just about guarantee is not what's on. Eric's radar, because if it was, he'd be doing it, which is anyway, neither here.
01:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't think it's a lot of people's radar, fortunately.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but that's okay.
01:13:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We can be weird together, Dan.
01:13:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, totally. All right, I will let you go. All right. lovely day. Oh, and that trip, you know, Denise was wanting some exotic, wonderful trip that she thought was once in a lifetime and never going to happen again. So. Maybe there's way to combine those things.
01:13:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, she wants to go to the make up for our 25th wedding anniversary next year, so I am going to set that up. Let's go back to the same island that we went to for our original honeymoon.
01:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That gave me goosebumps.
01:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can do that. So this is going to probably be Motelish. Yeah, we'll see.
01:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We'll see. I can be excited for Denise, though, for that happening.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's awesome.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're a good guy, Dan.
01:14:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right, good, sir.
01:14:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have a good day.

Sorry, was that a good morning, but then I remembered it's not morning for you.
00:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah. Yeah. and let me see if I can switch this story. No, I feel like crap today, I'm back at bad breakfast, and I just had way too much blooming. I made the mistake. There's a new pancake house I got opened up and I had some eggs baking and two pancakes. I only had one of the pancakes, but I'm still feeling like crap. So I'm even sweating, like, and at 70 degrees in the house, it's not even that bad.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can teach you some things that'll make you feel better, because I have those issues too.
00:00:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And yeah, I've spent thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars, and my sister says I'm a walking science experiment, which is true, and I'm also cramping really badly today. I wanted my Maria time. So I'm glad that you don't know, of course. Yeah, I know I wouldn't cancel. And but I probably will after this not work because I could listen to my body, too. And, you know, just not work. Just relax. And then, you know what? I'll wake up tomorrow morning, totally rejuvenated, fresh, ready to go.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just, I know I wanted to take tomorrow, because it's the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend starting.
00:01:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, I'll just at 1230 go with Amanda and my mom and we'll go to like parks, blueberries, and do a little mini trip in the fall, because all the fall colors are nice and stuff here.
00:01:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's really cool. Aw, that sounds awesome.
00:01:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Now, isn't that like a friend, a sister, who's a mini?
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is my partner. Okay. I didn't know that.
00:01:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I didn't. Yeah, because I hadn't really talked to you about her when we started and we lived together. And she just got back from Wales. She was in Wales visiting her dad and mom. She's from Wales.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have loves in my family. A lot. No way.
00:01:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh huh.
00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is wild because I feel like it's like 12 or 14 something.
00:02:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, I'm gonna look it up. Keep talking. Yeah, no because years and years ago I Just enamored with everything Celtic and I traveled through Scotland and that area and bought myself a really cool Celtic ring And I was just always attracted to it like From Welsh area like yeah, yeah, it's very much so well the whole Scott is Welsh area, but yeah The actual original high priestesses like which you really stuff is like from Whales and Merlin Merlin's from Wales Yeah, yeah, the whole King Arthur stuff Merlin.
00:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's there's yeah. Yeah, I get goosebumps. Okay.
00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I I I've always No, did and I even traveled north of Scotland to Orkney Islands where that's like the original human We're found or something really it's just so such I've always been drawn to that area and I know I married Rudy a guy like like While ago, but he also was from Europe. So I just think there's something about the Europe stuff.
00:03:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And my parents were Lithuania and they're born in Lithuania.
00:03:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. But yeah, but we typically don't talk a lot about it because she's really high up at the hospital here in Ontario. Like she's in charge of the whole woman's department, like big time. And so she just for her business too, she doesn't really, you know, come out even though she was married to another woman like ages ago. So I'm bi, like I'll just say it on bi. And so it was funny because when I divorced Rudy, lot of my friends like, you you need to be married to someone probably in health care, because everyone just takes so much from you. You need someone who's like a doctor or some kind of conversation. know, I know, I know that funny. And then my friend, my friend, you know, as we're drinking a bottle of wine, me and my friend, Siobhan, that I've known since grade six, and we've been best friends since, and I was her maid of honor wedding and all that. She we she just said, we're going to get you on elite singles, which is a more dating site, more for professionals, right? I don't know if it's in the US, but anyway, it's called lead professionals. Yeah, and then, yeah, and then that was about five years ago, and then we just started dating and like she, yeah, so she's so, she's the opposite of me. quite funny because I come from a conservative family as well, and all my dad and everything, like I vote liberal now, but my dad and family vote total of conservatives, their oil and gas executives, everything. So she even she's like, I never even dreamed I'd be in a family that's more like progressive conservative, like PC, like because she's really, she'd be the one that was out of all the protests, right? And she'd be the one like having with unions, which is younger, you know, because she wasn't a union before. But now, but now yeah, she's in charge of like a $25 million budget, like wow, 50 staff, nurses, you know, and smart and amazing. Yeah, and she's a very strong leader and a really good coach. Like she's just a really good, she's very, her emotional intelligence is off the charts super high. Yeah, so it's good.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have you been together?
00:05:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, we've lived together about four years now. We met five, six years ago. So yeah, yeah.
00:05:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know if I'm the one that's supposed to propose or whatever, like, because we're not really waiting stop, but I sometimes wonder if I should. Yes.
00:05:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But we live in a house. We could have our dream house like a couple blocks away from the water. And that's sort of maybe why, thankfully, but I don't ever want to use it as my crutch. I don't ever have to worry that I'm going to be out on the streets, right? she makes like, know, pretty, very high executive salary at the cost of stress, though, too, because so she's, you know, stressed out.
00:05:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the hospital world is massively stressful.
00:05:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's so much beer. Yeah. Well, yeah. and stuff that hurts her heart, too, because if she sees stuff, Being run wrong like it hurts her because it's like I came into health care because I want to help people and When in which you see some stupid stuff happening, then it hurts just hurts our heart, you know, so yeah Yeah I have a new spounce and sadness.
00:06:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I'm also like on my period. So like everything is extra extra extra Okay, so I'm absolutely 2% wows like they could go through and change it. I'm 37% What you go away? They keep changing it close? I'm gonna share with you my little interesting thing 37% England and North Western Europe 19% Portugal, so that's changed because originally they had that at 12% my father is First generation American on his side because his mother well on his mother outside because his mother was from Portugal and long, you know, generations, but his dad was navy and so met her.
00:07:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:07:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And then 10% Ireland, 7% Germanic Europe, 7% Scotland, 5% Central and Southern Philippines.
00:07:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow.
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
4% France, 3% Eastern China. Wait, my African has gone now? That's interesting. 3% Northern and Central Philippines. I have South and Central Philippines is 5% and 3% North and Central Philippines is 3%. 3% Spain, 2% Welsh. used to have 2% Nigerian and 1% Cameron and Congo. So I wonder if that how that got absorbed because nothing here is Africa anymore. That's interesting.
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, DNA is how much was Scotland?
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Scotland is 7%.
00:08:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, that's pretty high. So what's your highest one?
00:08:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, England and Northwestern Europe and then the second one is Portugal.
00:08:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, I got it.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, let's talk about Joe.
00:08:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think that?
00:08:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. Any other like you gave me an update and I was barely coming to consciousness. um, uh, on your, so you haven't heard back from the one client?
00:08:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, uh, he did. Actually, it was really sweet. And maybe just to give it justice, I'll just read it out. Let me go to Facebook. So you can see what response was. Yeah. Um, he's had a lot of happen to him in the last two weeks. So he just wants about a week to look over everything, but he feels it's the right thing to do.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my God, that's so excited for you.
00:08:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I'm excited about what we, yes, but I'm excited about what we went through yesterday because I know. If we make a right power pitch and stuff, and even if I make a video of that on my Facebook page, I know that we'll get a couple clients, and maybe we just, if we wanted to, yeah, get a client a month, you know, like, I just told my Samantha, I call her my Samantha.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she is, she was Cory Michelle's project manager. She actually lived in a house with Cory Michelle. They called me to see Palace. What? They were so cold. The women that lived there, there were so many women that lived there. was just like, I would have call it like estrogen something, yeah, but Samantha is a little racier than I am.
00:09:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:09:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that whole family, but anyway, so she was her project manager and I was Cory Shane's project manager at the time. And so we ended up just like, we're like souls, like, just, we love each other.
00:09:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, I love you. Like already.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we didn't talk for a few years, just kind of living life and going through stuff, and then we reconnected a few years ago. And then last year, I'm just like Samantha, my mission is like I've got to talk to women more. I need to feed my legal connections, I need to draw strength from my sisters, and I need to give strength to my sisters. And so we did that, and then I did that with my friend Stephanie and a few other people, and I'm just like, I love when I listen to God, because he loves us, he loves his daughters so much. And yeah, anyway, so I was telling her about the stuff that we're doing, and I'm like, I would be so happy, because honestly, Maria, I don't think business is my lifelong thing. I feel like when my girls are grown, that God is going to have me going to these third world countries. I don't know where I'll be, but I think it will be. And it's interesting, because I'm reading this book by Clayton M. Christensen, who was also So LES that he's passed away, and he was a Harvard business professor, my guy actually has learned from him and done business with him. I feel like weird and dizzy, but anyway, what's it called? Oh, the prosperity... Hold on, complex? The prosperity paradox. So basically the premise that I'm picked up so far, because I'm barely into the book, that most of the time when people have prosperity, they want to impart it to other people, like donate money, but that's not what you need to do. What you need to do is teach people how to be prosperous for themselves. It's the whole give them an edge teaching how to fish kind of thing. And I don't want anything in life. just want to be a service. I want health, want energy, but my joy... it does come from making other people happy and laboring. And I could see myself just going and teaching like you've seen how ideas just come out of my head and I can structure it and create an implement. And remember I told you about patriarchal blessings? Yes. My patriarchal blessing and I received it at 19 told me to study leadership that it was important and that the Lord had an important work for me to do and that it was that I would help people find and follow the path back to him. But it would be through leadership. And I don't care about leadership from an ego standpoint. I don't care about hierarchy or pecking order. I'm just as happy following as I am leading as long as good leadership. But I'm not afraid of it. A lot of people are, you know, they don't want to step on toes. don't want to whatever. I don't want to step on toes. But also I just know the value of structure and getting things done. I just kind of plow through and apologize later. Anyway, but to this point, like I don't have a business I'm trying to build. I don't have something I need to want to sell. just want to take care of what I need to take care of and enjoy what I'm doing while I'm doing it. Like for me, it is the journey. So if you were able to create this offer and I'm able to take care of the families that I'm financing and still be able to have enough money where I can grow for the future in case I can't work or something happens to my guy or something happens to our money, because nothing is guaranteed, especially with our government in their over a few months. I'm like, I would just be, I just think about that. like, that's all I want. I'm very simple. So if I got to spend my days and part of it is working with you and we're blessing other businesses. just think what I'm so simple that would make me happy. I was thinking about that this morning.
00:14:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
thought I would share that with you. Thank you. Yeah. No, I kind of the same too because I think was it you that I said, after I hung up a few, I don't know I said that to you, but I said, a man, a man, I've had known her four or five years ago. I'd be writing probably a $50 million business.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:14:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're like, where are you not doing the agency yet? And Amanda looked at me and said, I hope you're not serious about wanting $50 million. And I'm like, no, no, but I just mean all the hard work, all the hours I've worked over the last like four or five years, every single week, giving, giving them a clients. they're the ones that are millionaires. then even how, you know, this has went down with Crena, like I'm just like, I know this wouldn't have happened to me if I had her by my side, know, four or five years ago, she goes, okay, I said, honestly, Amanda, like I'd be happy just with half a million or a million. I know it's not about, I've made a million a month at one time in my real estate investment business ages, but I know it's not about that anymore because that with that becomes such responsibility. Yes.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And such like other things. can and they're stressed like because then you've got fake friends like there's so much that has excessive amount of money and temptation because the devil is good at what he does, you know, and it's not necessary like big deal kind of things like but it doesn't matter. It's slippery slope with big things like we're more prone to ego maybe when you have more.
00:15:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, it was really important that God not make me too cute because I definitely have the type of personality that if I was so cute, I'd be all over Instagram shaking my body something like that.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He needed me to not like think that I'm just gorgeous or anything because I probably couldn't be trusted with such beauty. I love that. And for me, I, I, I feeling appreciated and seen and validated. Yeah. But also to know that I'm with somebody who is, um, like to, to be with a mama bear with a mom. Oh, yeah. So beautiful. Like to get to sort of care of other people with someone else. So I thought I had about Joe, though. Wait, I do want to know a little bit more about your guy.
00:16:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, I do that, let's just, yeah, close the loop of my guy, because we're just in the waiting game. So I think I, I'm comfortable with what I said to him. So it should or get off the pot. So he has a lot happened to him, right? Cause he, cause well, on the phone, like he had a good friend of him die tragically a week ago. Um, and he was also in a car accident. So recently, so he's suffering from headaches. So we said, we're on the same page, but I need to spend more time with the doc and note some questions. I'm not sure if I told you, but I'm suffering from headaches from a car accident. My friend died tragically week ago, and I'm in the midst of another super time conceiving stuff. Give me a week or two to merge so that I can give the best of myself to this, my number one priority project. I'll develop questions in the meantime so we can hit the ground running. Does that work? I said, let's move the combo to email. excited to be with you. I was telling my husband, it just feels right. I said, hey, it does feel right. I feel so long if you're off or in future vision. And I guess I should have emailed this to him. Actually, I will after this. And yes, you've been through a lot. So take a week or so to review for sure. One quick question. Can you put a small deposit down to hold your spot with me? I only ask that as there's two others I'm talking to, which is true as well. And my bandwidth is really to take one new client on for this year because I'm not like, I can't take three clients that they said all said yes today. So, you know, just being honest with us, would, would like a one K to positive be okay.
00:18:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Something to consider for future is that I wouldn't let somebody take now time even for that. But what I could say is I'll give it to you but what I can say is I can't promise it to you. So you take all the time that you need to and say and I don't mean this as a sales pitch but as you can see I'm making movements right now and it's attracting people and I'm not going to hold a spot open not for a thousand dollars not for anything. If you want to pay and work now we can and it isn't that I don't appreciate everything that you're going to through. It's just that I have put momentum out and it makes no sense for me to pull it back. If he knows it's for him then he will. will come to you quicker. And it but also what you should trust that that the right thing will come, but I don't let people hold me back anymore. Yeah, isn't out of disrespect for what they're going through.
00:19:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's trust that the timing will align when it needs to align. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just something to think about.
00:19:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's true. Yeah, yeah, Yeah, it's my my sorry, my gut reaction is like I think what we presented was on fire and like I want hell yes people. Like I want him to say hey I've got crazy stuff put on for the next week's but I can put some money down to hold the spot with you.
00:19:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes. So what's it gonna say? Oh yeah, so the thing is that you're in a situation now of you've got an open loop in your brain. And that costs you, it costs you energy, it costs you confidence, because you are now already in a way beholden to him by by your choice and allowance. If other people came in, you would think, Oh, but I have to save space for him. And he hasn't done anything to earn it other than say I'm interested, which is not enough. And so you risk potentially either throttling somebody. But here's what I need you to understand, you will be throttling energetically. Because you've got this open energy attached to him already. He is taking space in your time, in your life, in your brain, even if it's just a little bit, he's getting something from you without putting anything in. And that's what what happens when we have these conversations, like Joe is already be taking from you.
00:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's taking from you.
00:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anybody else is. Now, it's the nature of the business that you will give to some, but you can only give so much. Yeah. who aren't paying you. So you have to be aware that all of these exchanges are withdrawals from deposits to them without deposits back to you. Sooner or later, you become bankrupts doing that, but you could have discovery calls, don't you, though, to like close people? never have all of my stuff has been 100% word of mouth, but this is the clarity process. It can happen. Yes, you can have discovery calls, but you need to recognize that the way that you handle them is what constitutes and creates a situation. of how much of a withdrawal they can make from you without making the deposit.
00:22:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So if I had the pitch deck ready, they could then keep asking me questions and get consulting from me for free. would say, let me show you what happens when you start working with me when we actually engage in a sacred commerce transaction.
00:22:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This what I can do. You see now looking at when I talked about doing your pedigree, because the process of that is, here are the results I get. And then when you put all your different things that you have to offer. Now you're coming up, you showed me the Emily Hirsch, like the calculator image and then the pitch deck and all of that stuff. So when I say that these exercises lead to something, what it leads to is you having clarity about your value, which makes it much easier for you to get clarity to your people about your value. And then, so we've also gotten clear and clear on an offer on you where the guardrails are. We've talked about effective hourly rate.
00:23:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
this is taking us weeks and multiple conversations that we can see the pace and the power of it.
00:23:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, you're on the back to people not being able to do that anymore. He's back to you.
00:23:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's back. Oh, let me just let me just get this food.
00:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I put his food on the counter. Let me just go get it and bring it down. I'll be right back. No problem. Come on.
00:23:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Come on. He's really, um, I couldn't find the cannon food, but I haven't tried it but he's fully ready. Oh, that's fine. gonna tell that to now. I'm be able to find the word you can't do. That's what it's out on the show. Oh, that's a shot. So, that's business. Oh, he brings it on that side. He's okay. So, we're going do the walk. Yeah. I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do the the walk. walk. I'm Okay, I can't remember which is right, which is left on the headphones.
00:24:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I never think about that, but yeah, my my bows quite comfort on my. Yeah, they're not cute, but they're very comfortable. I have sensitive ears.
00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can't just use anything. I, I do too. Like I have these other ones. And, but yeah, they feel a little and I have Sony or something. Anyways, I'd like you though too.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like it's like, I feel like the Princess and the P or whatever. Like, oh my gosh, you gotta try three different ones before I find one that's comfortable.
00:24:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, ah, anyways, but yeah, no, you're right. Because. I'm not used to selling to totally cold people. guess everyone who's ended up usually hiring me, you're right. It's through for all or through Going through one of my challenges or some of my courses and they're sold on me So it's like basically they're like how do I get started with you?
00:25:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was the question, you know Well, and if you weren't charging higher prices for your time That's different also because yep have to persuade people at a different level And they need more structure in the presentation like you have to put more into the pitch when you're Crisis, yeah, yeah, yeah Especially when it's not for Fulfillment or they're dictating your time or all kinds of different things like that.
00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know what I mean this so There's a higher yeah proof Yeah, yeah, yeah um So so basically so there's that so I didn't like how he said he wants to go through the document He has questions for us. I'm like either in your out. That was one thing I was like, that's not a good sign that kind of means he's never going to pull the trigger is my first reaction when I read that actually.
00:26:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can always go back and change your message and just say, you know what, really like the conversations I'm having today. Here's what I need to tell you. And you can say something like I'm a big believer in timing and aligning and with all the respect and reverence for your situation. If this is the right thing for you, then we'll be able to connect when the time is right for you. But because I've generated so much momentum and having these conversations, I can't the conscience, not serve others who are ready to go or create space that's for you if you're not ready yet.
00:27:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, but when you're ready, let me know. I would love to help you work on this, whatever. And your, your main project business and help it grow. And I hope that your healing and comfort and all that stuff comes, but. You know, So, so you, and then you can say, so disregard the, the deposit. I'm really, I'm really not looking for hold to hold space for a deposit. I'm really just ready to do the work.
00:27:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I still to recall it doesn't look like he's read it.
00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. There's new setting in messenger that you can set it to show that to not have read receipt.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So he could have seen it. Okay. All right. Got it.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. All right. You know, some people can see the preview and. So to me, that's just like, okay, well, I'd rather just be fully transparent.
00:28:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Got it. Okay.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Joanne, yeah.
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it just, I have such unclearness in working with her. Like it's like, how do we want to close the loop? do you want me to do kind of what I suggested on the voxer?
00:28:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you show me? Uh, hold on a second. Yes, I'm going to hold on. Let me see if my babies need something. Yeah. Um, okay. Boxer where we at. Um, Oh, yeah, you were talking about a limb going over her stuff. So what I was thinking is, what if we, um, do that together? can like take a snippet of this portion. the video or something and go over it together. That way we're still unified and we can edit anything out that we wanted to if like we say something that was just between us or whatever. But that way you don't have to go do it by yourself and have an additional burden, we can just knock it out right now and then you're done.
00:29:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in order to do that, let me see what I wrote to you. would have to just take a quick look at her ads, give her things on that and then suggest the affiliate thing. I think we could open up a word doc and let's see where I put that. email us as just just suggesting something complementary operations team that's where you would talk to. And then do we want to give her the quote of?
00:30:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's what I was looking at thinking about right now. So, first of all, one of the ways that I would frame it is basically what you're gifting to her right now is an audit. This is something that is something that I would sell an audit. I don't give audits for free.
00:30:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, but Tina, did say like on the call, that three hour call, whatever that night. We should have said, okay, pay us $2,000 an hour to look at business.
00:30:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But instead we did say we should charge her for it. I'm just saying let her be aware that there's value in this. Yeah, got it, got it, got it. We're already, you know what I mean? So just saying that's all I'm just framing, just appreciate like hoping that she would appreciate that we're already giving her time.
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, that's all. Yeah, I'm-framing it so she doesn't think we do this on the regular and take advantage of us.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Yes, framing the value. That's that's exactly what I'm talking about. Um, and then So going through it and giving it to her and I wouldn't give too much to it like what I would say like if you look at our ads You you might say something like I could see I would tweak Um, there are several things I would tweak about this that I think would give more leverage not this is what I would tweak I wouldn't do like you know what I mean? I wouldn't give away the recipe I would just say I see the recipe in my mind very easily Does that make sense?
00:31:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so just like high level.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, um, and then say um And maybe there's two offers so There are two versions of this where we can give you the strategy and the structure and your team can implement or um We can give you the strategy and structure and we can manage it for you And there are obviously different prices. So one, um, you're getting our high-level strategy, but not as much time so we can give that to you for $4,000, $6,000. $6,000 was the original price.
00:32:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's basically still what we're doing.
00:32:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or $10k a month because you're getting your time fully and my time or whatever you feel like. So it could be...
00:32:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She wants us to help her raise the money. What she specifically said is up her raise $5 million.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She doesn't need us to do that. She just needs the strategy, that's already in my mind. get one of your people to go reach out to like I suggested high-profile black women because that nurturing motherhood in them and she... don't remember who she said. not just tell her to swing up, but she said, there was a, was it Rihanna, like somebody. Anyway, she had mentioned a name and I was like, yeah, there's this whole group of women that would probably help raise that money very quickly. Anyway, it's still mostly strategy, I think, is that what she needs and she can manage a team. That would be in her best interest is just to get our high level minds on it and the clarity and then manage it. If there is organized and structured as she says they are, then that's all they need.
00:33:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so what if I share screen here for a second? So what if it's like just kind of, it would give come up better names you want, but ads review, more cash and existing assets, fine complimentary.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The way that I used to do business audits is, it's a good try on, try it on and see if it's the same. So if we don't like working for her, we didn't even open the door to a long time working, and if she doesn't like working with us, the same thing. So we can let her know that this is the entry offer period, that is the only one. If we do this and she likes it and wants to work with us, then we can have the next conversation. And if not, we are very competent that she will be happy with that work and that investment. And she can either take it or not. Because this is more cash-resistant assets, like if she finds the right company in Philly prior, that should bring in 10k a month, don't you think at least with the size of not only that, all it really has to do is bring in enough to pay what she invested in us. And then she's not lost anything, but the compounding effect means now she's getting that money back on repeat. And so she will have earned money from us.
00:36:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if I was going to offer that aligns. Well, with goals of strategy for the doc major film, say doc major document. Film. Film Your goals. So I would just say working with us. Us film projects. Please see.
00:36:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I would do strategically is after a documentary film project, comma, doubling the world breastfeeding rate and generating revenue because that's actually Yeah, work me asked with the documentary after film project, comma, leading to doubling the world breastfeeding rate.
00:37:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And, and increasing your annual sales.
00:37:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and. And, yeah.
00:37:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she specifically said 10 million. Yeah.
00:37:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I would say, I like the way that you wrote it better because the conversation that I would have with her if we do this is like. I don't support arbitrary goals. doubling the world breastfeeding rate to me is not arbitrary. There is real. value in the impact to humanity through that, that could be quantified. There is no real value that you could quantify and really spell out with having $10 million profit.
00:38:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
First of all, it speaks to no profit margin.
00:38:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Second of all, what are you going to do with that revenue? That goes whatever, like there is no real value associated with that, but there is with the rest of it anyway.
00:38:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. Got it. Okay. So, I want to at least look at her ads, like just on my own for about five minutes or so, like a boo, unless you want me to do it with me on it. And then that's pretty obvious, like her stuff, like EG, yoga for pregnant moms, what other affiliate products that is good for her?
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pro-lapse treatments, like what do you call it, pelvic floor exercises, things that happen, know, after you have a baby. Like our stuff on Clickbank, you think, or specifically, or other? Potentially. I'm sure that there's something there. Or, I mean, I have no idea what exists now, commission junction.
00:39:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:39:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but also mental health. After you have a baby. Um, there's a lot that that women go through and postpartum I don't use this except for just. I don't even remember the last time I was in Clickbank. What's funny though, is that I have an alarm on my phone to remind me to go back and look at it.
00:39:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, woman.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Health. Coffee Shop Millionaire was like number one in business for a while on ClickBank.
00:40:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Parenting in families maybe?
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe. Well, you can just search. Oh, wait. That's what you did. Women's Health.
00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hi, Score. Yeah.
00:40:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
would put it like, so what, yeah, anyway, I don't even think you have to go that deep.
00:40:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There will be affiliate offers. Yeah.
00:40:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. If you go create the affiliate partnership with somebody who didn't even have an affiliate program. Yeah. think outside the boss. She is.
00:40:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Well, yeah. And I have, um, actually have a woman that does do a pelvic floor exercise, no ticket offer. So yeah, that actually probably those two could connect, but I'm not going to do it for free, connect them for free.
00:40:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's for sure.
00:40:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. That's, that's that brand dealer here. Okay. All right. Alright, so there we go. So digit with the public floor exercise. I don't know what else. Or more stuff?
00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, for sure. Any kind of self-care, honestly. And it's female community support, like if there are besides breastfeeding, but just like if you have these, I don't know. There's just, there's just so much.
00:41:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I have a minimum 10k month operations team. Do you want to go away for five minutes, 10 minutes to and then come back to me and you want to call her?
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, either way Like what's easiest like or do you just want to stay on the call right now and hit record I? Don't have any like there's nothing I would go get started for five or ten minutes So I mean and when I'm done with this call I'm done working and I'll go do other things for the day So I'm good to sit here and watch or come back whatever you want Know what I mean Do you know what you're gonna say to her about operations team? Sorry based on what she gave us I'd have to ask questions because she gave us the org chart and she makes it sound like everything works as You know like great. So I Would have more questions About that But operations is hardly all that I do Okay, so I guess we're getting go ahead So I just don't know okay, so do you want me to take this out like No, just as we I don't I don't know. Um, so sorry.
00:43:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My brain is like, sorry stories. I was just thinking because you wanted to have her give us all this information. Yeah, so but she did.
00:43:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what she didn't do is say how many hours a week everybody works. So she didn't answer that question. But she she constantly talks about how well everything is organized.
00:43:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Mm hmm.
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so there's a disconnect there. And, um, I don't know. I don't have an immediate, like I would make this strategy a suggestion to her. But yeah, there's nothing super clear there. To me, the bigger play is marketing, but, um, staying on the top of the marketing, looking at the numbers and making sure that all of that makes financial. sense, but I don't even know. I don't know. I'm not, I really, um, almost actively repelled by it. Um, because there seems to be too many incongruencies. And, um, so it's basically let's just get this done so she stops bothering us and we're in congruity with at least talking to her. so she has bad mothers.
00:44:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That got it. Okay.
00:44:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's. Oh, I know what it was. I was going to, I was going to say this and then we talked, we closed the loop with Garrett. What's his name?
00:44:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Something. Uh, Grant Miller. And there's a G and an R there.
00:44:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. The thought that I was having earlier is that, um, you know, there are, sometimes you really are aligned with the mission. Sometimes you really like the person, but sometimes the business model just doesn't connect. And that's this, this incongruency of like how she sees her business versus always getting the results, the fact that she's gone through six agencies in a year, got it. There are red flags and I don't want to wrestle, I'm in no mood to wrestle. And I'm also in, and so here's where the wrestle is. The wrestle is in, she wants to paint this beautiful picture, but she has a messy picture she wants to have corrected. She is, this is cognitive dissonance, right? She's aware it's messed up. She wants it fixed to align with the vision that she has, but she's pretending that that's how it already is. So when somebody is not able to be fully honest about their situation, that causes too much. much mental friction, I refuse to deal with it. That's their mess. I don't want to deal with it. I love the mission. I think she's wonderful. I don't want to touch the business.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I agree. There's something off about it too that I see too. So, yeah. okay, so do we want to it's recording right now automatically. So, do you want to stop recording, restart, and then get me the recording? do you want me to give you a link to my Zoom and record it on my Zoom and then we just get it done.
00:46:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so my recording goes to my computer and I automatically stop it and then there's Fathom which does a separate recording and we could always take that and clip it so we could do anyway. We could stop and join your Zoom and then you have all the files and you have the control and you can do whatever you want to do.
00:46:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's just yeah, that's probably easiest than we don't have to edit or take anything out. It's just like we stop and start one section that we want for her. Okay, so I'll just give you on. Box or my zoom link. Do you want me to do that?
00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:47:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. I'll hang on.
00:47:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm gonna go get some migraine glasses real quick and probably

## Quote 13

> 00:00:00 - Chris Mason
Interested in for him is he he has this he developed this app the software that uses in his gym and it's like in 25 other gyms That That tracks each individual because the the model the model that he runs is called semi-private So it's like one trainer to six trainees and they pay like a hundred bucks a week And so with that model You you can get to a million dollars with only you know a couple hundred members and And so that's so he built this app that it When the trainee is doing their workout like they they see what their workout is on the app they log Their workout and then it You when they hit a PR or there's like celebration what's their universal? tree, celebration kind of thing there, but I'd like to explore a little bit more of that. So that's on my radar for the future and seeing that as selling it as a SaaS to other gyms. And that feels like an opportunity for me to be able to share in that revenue because he he would sell it for a couple hundred bucks a month. So that's on my radar. And then I had a few conversations at the Grow Summit with a couple of gyms, one of the speakers, and those years new relationships I follow up with them over email for back from two. I'm going to meet with one of them. We're emailing back and forth to find a time and he actually has a he works with him and he has an agency and is a gem owner. I don't know his full story. If you saw this guy, he would not look like a gem owner. would look like an alcoholic. He would look like a... but...
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sorry.
00:02:20 - Chris Mason
So I'm going to have that call with him and we'll just see. No, it's just relationships. and then with with Brian, with Titans, he actually... I'm in the middle of an email exchange with him now because he didn't want to do this live event. He backed out of that and so I just asked him like, is this... or have you reached the limit of the amount of work that you want to be doing? Because that's helpful for me to know. and He said that Okay Don't run your ideas Okay, so I told him I was like, you know, let me know if you reached your your max and I can when I come up with ideas I can run the idea through the filter of is this going to create more work for Brian? he said don't don't run it through that filter Rather run it through the filter of if it's not in Brian's sweet spot Who can he slash we pay to do it My checkbook is still the most valuable tool in my toolbox and they said please keep thinking without filters
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and then filter but still it is definitely much more clear yeah so that was five that was five days ago i i haven't responded then he just sent me an email i have given you that same filter many times he's not as clearly and and and brian and brian's word but which is um so the difference is the thing that he really clarified is his sweet spot um so what we need is for him to define what how he sees that because how i would have defined it and i think this is based off of what you would say is that brian loves talking to the people yeah but he um and this is why he really needs to clarify because live events but but um at his convenience and when he feels like it to me, that's the thing, because if he's not feeling well, if something's going on in his life, or he just doesn't feel like doing it, like, to me, that's his sweet spot, but it's not a dependable sweet spot. So I think that he might not being really knowing himself or paying attention. Because to me, that's the issue. Do you do you like, how do you see that? What would you say is his sweet spot that you can consistently count on?
00:05:34 - Chris Mason
Well, he, earlier in this, you know, he talked about his definition of retirement. So it's like, well, he wants to, if he's going to do something, he said, the live event qualifies under two, my three rules of retirement. It's something I'm good at and it attracts people I want to hang around with. the third issue, it doesn't qualify in the present. It's something I don't like to do. And then he talks about, like, he, I guess he had a
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a really bad taste in his mouth because one of his mastermind events like nobody showed up and he was really you know that but it was during covid and anyway um hit I mean I don't know what his sweet spot is so you added another thing that we need to have qualified quantified which is who does he want to hang around with and does he always want to hang around them or does you know like what are the parameters because you have to think in filters because here's the thing and this is what you should say um in your way he has committed to doing things and not done them every year to the point of things getting canceled. And sometimes we're for health reasons, but not every time. So, how many times have you canceled anything that you committed to?
00:07:16 - Chris Mason
Never.
00:07:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Whereas I have never done that. So, trying to figure out what your parameters are, I can only guess, because we don't operate the same. And that, you know, some of the old-timers and I will take that as flippant, pass it aggressive. It's not. It's just the truth. And so if, like, you need to know, should I ask you about this? Because you guys have a menu. basically. These are the things we do. Is there anything on this menu that you never want to do? Is there anything on this menu that you really, really would like to do, but potentially may not do? Like, this is what I need to know, because all the things that you've agreed to and not done, you agreed to. You're grown , man, a grain is something and you don't do it. Now the health stuff is completely separate. Yeah. Right. daughter's running was a plan thing. Yeah. You know, just not being in the mood for stuff happens. Now it may be that he's actually really feeling bad and not fully being transparent. That also happens too. But the point is that probably at least 50% of the time Brian over commits and doesn't do something. But that over commitment is not an unreasonable business commitment. So for sure. Or that he wants to speak to it or not, there are limitations significant in the way that he will show up in business. So now you need to ask yourself how much effort do you want to put into a conversation with somebody who is not honest with themselves, much less you?
00:09:20 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I was, I want to walk today and I came back and I was just thinking about, and I didn't have this email from Brian yet, because he sent me an email an hour ago saying, I didn't get a response from you on this, although it didn't require one, but I love your thoughts, smiley face, just wanted to explain myself further. So he wants me to reply, I was thinking about that email I just read to you from a few days ago and just feeling this like, he, I didn't, I don't think I thought this, but like, he may not, I don't. I don't know that I can that's not what I'm wanting to say this is not what I want to say, but I'll say it like I can't count or depend on him for things I'd for like when he says I want to do this live event, and then he he backs out and I guess I'm just thinking I'm ahead of like, I need to there's opportunity there and I started I was like what what are the opportunities with with Brian that that don't require me to have to do it a ton of things and wrangle his schedule and I was like, you know, I've been wanting to do a new experience and on the break through advertising sales page. I started thinking about like what are things that I earn pieces on, and then I had this idea last night, is what kind of got me thinking about. about it. Michael Cinoff has just a ton of like old-school seminars and products and I mean he's probably got hundreds and I was like you know we've got all these TXL members captive like they love Ryan and we never really sell them anything we give them stuff for free and I started thinking about I wonder if we could do a deal with Michael where we're just offering like his digital training things and Brian can talk about the the glory days and and we sell to TXL they get a discount we sell to his list and and there's that connection to the the the OG days I guess yeah so I had that thought last night of You're just trying to think of something that's simple that doesn't require, I mean, I'd love it if Brian would show up to, you know, to do like a live event or something, but it's like, it just doesn't feel like I can bank on that.
00:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What if you just kind of brain dump and you whatever can rip on it, but look at the opportunities that you're interested in What the thing could be, what the price could be, what the revenue could be if we get X amount of people in it based off of experience, right? So some calculations with the potential upsell to something, whether it be into TXL or something else, and then go, okay, this is what it would take to fulfill it. This is what Chris would do. This is what Brian would do. Now, if Brian isn't interested in it, so create the contingency with the plan originally. If Brian isn't interested in, we could do it Chris alone. We could do it Chris plus a guest. We could do it Chris plus, you know, past recordings of Brian. We could do it with Chris plus. It's Brian prepares a video ahead of time just on his own convenience since you guys are making like podcast type content and it could be repurposed into little clips that way, like what are all the things and the partnerships that it's in. Brian's world. So he gets a piece of it. And but also for your own, you are your own man, and you have your own connection and you're developing them on your own merit. So not everything needs to come back to Brian. So when you look at that, let's go, okay, what, what on your own, just do it on your own. And then if there's something you're like, this really, I would only want to do it if I do it with Brian, then then present that. And then start making your decision. But say to him. If you commit to this, I need your agreement that the only reason that you would not do this would be, you know, severe help.
00:14:53 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just I change my mind and I don't feel interested in it. You ought to have the conversation about reliability and potentially over-committing. I think it's time for you to start speaking a little more plainly in terms of accountability. Brian likes to feel good. He needs to feel He wants everybody to like him, wants to, you know, and there's nothing wrong with that. Until it gets in the way of truth, you need clarity, clarity requires truth, and he doesn't do that. Like I said, not necessarily honest with himself, and I don't think it's malicious. I think it's just, I think it's a defense mechanism. I think that other that that emotional discomfort is difficult. And so he kind of dances around things a little bit. And I don't think you're gonna change that in him. And I don't think you want to change that in him. I don't think you want to do that work. So what I think that you do is just really think about his patterns and what what he really does show up well for. And give him a chance to say yes or no, but really look him in the camera eyes and say. Do you think that even if you're having a rough emotional week, you'd still want to show up and do this? Unless like, you know, you're in the hospital and you're having some symptoms or something like that. Like I really need to know. How not just Brian on a great day feels, but Brian on a this week is rough. This month has been. like, do you think that you'd still want to do this? Because if you don't, let's create the contingency right now. And if we get, you know, and depending on what the contingency is, if the contingency is you do it on your own, you just plan and prepare for that. So you're good to go. If the build it with the other person and Brian can come in as an additional bonus. You know, those, anyway, those are just some, some ways to think about it. I do think it's time for you to spend a lot less energy building around Brian.
00:17:45 - Chris Mason
Yeah, that's, I wasn't probably time. It feels like a could pull back from Brian just in terms of like how much time I spent thinking about what to do to grow that business. I remember when I went through that traction book or whichever one talks about the integrator.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rocket fuel?
00:18:21 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel.
00:18:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Traction Matt had talked about it too, but rocket fuel.
00:18:25 - Chris Mason
Rocket fuel. I went through their test and I wasn't quite like a full-blown integrator, but I was definitely not a visionary. One of the things I've appreciated and I've been thinking about this lately just because I haven't had this in a long time, like a really good about like setting a vision of like what do you want. And I've I've felt in me like when I have that Like I can I can go there's fire. There's energy and you're not the only one bringing it Yeah, I think I was thinking like when I was working with Lee like I came up with all the ideas Working with Brian's like and now even in this email. He's asking me to come up with the ideas and It's like man. I Yeah Yeah So But I have really appreciated that about Tim and And it's got me it I was thinking over the weekend Actually on my way back from Chicago is like like really like being In this little team Like because I got to meet everybody that I've only seen and it was the dinner together like it was really cool and fun and this girl Amanda you know she's she's got a couple of like product ideas that she shared with me that she just doesn't know how to bring them to life and we talked about maybe just kind of jamming together once the dust settles from the sun but one of them is targeting the wives of people who are into prepping and I forget it was usually called like it's not this plush prepper or something but basically like why should you give up your free fee girly things so it's like prepper stuff but for for women. And I was like, that's an interesting niche in that market. And so anyway, I mean, right now, my whole thing is just like where my thing I think about is like, what can I do that will bring me revenue. And then I'm just going to do that. And I'm just going to work and keep making my connections with people. We've got the breakthrough advertising bootcamp coming up in October.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask you question. Do you remember, since in a while, what we figured out your effective hourly rate is?
00:21:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, with 10, with 10 is like 70, 75. And, but that was, was doing two hours of work a day, and so I, since we did that, I've just been doing one hour.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. And what about with Brian?
00:22:14 - Chris Mason
Uh, with Brian. I don't think we calculated that.
00:22:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to, because here's, there's a lot of opportunity around you. And I love that you're realizing that you need to be with higher energy people. Because energy is contagious. And if your energy isn't the thing that's being caught, you're catching other people. Yeah. it can drag you down. And that's really, you've been fighting it. there hasn't been a lot of awareness about that. It was, but it was, it wasn't at the surface. It wasn't in the conscious subconscious way. Yes. But energy is not enough. Earning potential is huge. You're in another situation, though, with Tim as energizing as it is and as good as the team is, where you're not the offer owner and you're not earning anywhere near your potential. So we need to have a minimum effective ROE rate target. And I really think it should be $250 an hour minimum right now, like ASAP. So I think that everything that you do needs to be ran through a filter like that. So there is fun stuff about working with cool people and helping out the amandas care of. So first things first is we've got to improve your earnings per hour. like immediately. Because then you can do the fun stuff. this is the thing. Really, I don't know anybody else that talks about it and I, we talk about it and our stuff and I'm just going to, I think I'm just going to keep harping on this and be teaching everybody. Most of us need to have tiered offers and it isn't just about income but it's also about fulfillment and need. So I have three and they're not even tears. They're more like arms, right? arms. I've got my little Etsy store. It is not profitable. It oozes money. It's a creative outlet but it has compounding power because every time I create the product it can be sold on multiple platforms but it also it's niche. There's kind of LDS phrases, things like that. It's a spiritual thing. I create things that other people haven't. slightly but that slight difference in messaging really can be whether something just really slaps and just hits like yes that's me or not right so it really isn't about profit and that's okay and I'm consciously making that choice and that's just all there is to it but it fulfills in a way nothing else does then there are my high-level people my doctors my attorneys just like you know they're a thousand dollars an hour they're seven and eight bigger businesses they hit differently everything that I do I can spend an hour with them and make their whole years worth of investing in me giving them something to do so there's a few things about that first of all I have to keep my saw super sharp I really have to be thinking on a time I have to have my data organized I really have to have my numbers organized I have to take good notes. I have to, you know what I mean? Like, I have to be on the top of my game. I've been able to not be on the top of my game and still get paid really well and then still be happy. But the more I am on top of it, the happier I feel, the less stressed I feel about having to replace them, the better they do, the more that they go make referrals. So that pays for everything. That's the income generator, but it's also the, you know, keeping me super sharp kind of thing. And because I'm looking to leverage them always and which means smallest teams possible, max profit possible, it gets me staying on top of things. check all the different AIs, all the new types of tools, including in the medical field with HIPAA compliance and all these different types of things. So like I'm playing at high level across the board and I don't do that anywhere else, but that takes a toll on me mentally. and I can only do so much of that. I can't do that more than two hours a day.
00:27:04 - Chris Mason
if I do it two hours day, I'm spent for a while.
00:27:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's really limited. I can't have a lot of that. Then there's the give back. There's the people. I just want to help all the moms. I want to help the dads too, but especially the moms. the moms are gonna go help the dads. moms are gonna help the brothers. It's like, then they're gonna be taken care of if I take care of the women. 100%. But I want to be able to help them. And that is not a very profitable thing in the offers that I'm thinking about doing because they can't pay as high level. My earnings per hour to start with, like if the number gets bigger, but then I have to hire more people and manage because the more important thing to me is really serving that community very well. So the margins are going to be much smaller. They should still be good, but much smaller. a lot more group effort and but it's a completely different level of fulfillment, a different level of I'm going to say the same things over and over and over and over and over again, which I kind of do anyway, because fundamental concepts, right? But I'm going to say the real big stick things over and over again. And so that doesn't satisfy my big brain efforts, right? The one is like, let me think about all the fun exciting new things, let me learn, let me explore. And on top of that, I'm also serving my mission on top of that, I'm in school for my psychology degree. So, which sounds like a lot and compared to how it's been for the last several years, but I was bored in languishing and I didn't know that. But with those are the compartments. And so when I'm looking at everybody, unless it's, well, even the doctors and attorneys, the entrepreneur visionary ones that reach out to me, they love marketing. They love automations. They love leverage. So I'm working with people who are also, no matter what they're doing, they're not the average type. They have different levels of fulfillment that needs to happen. So all of us need something that has staying power that has the compounding. It's the steady rock, right? So it's got a community. You've got followers. You've got a constant message that really just doesn't change. It's a fundamental message. It's a fundamental thing for you. think it's copy and marketing or maybe even just direct response itself, which is getting people to respond to you based off of what you're doing. But there's also just kind of business. I would really put you more in the marketing realm of what gets excited because of what you go back to most. is offers and serving the the market. So, but you're also interested in business and you're interested in freedom and you're interested in self-providence and you're interested in sustainability and you're interested in people working for their own values not for some arbitrary amount of dollars, not for shiny objects because you want to keep up with the Joneses, right? So, you're the, we talked about this before like average Joe, but the not average, like it's not average. It's think that, so when I'm talking to you about me, to change things. What I think it is is that, and I also know that when we get clearer on what we want, that's when it comes to us, right? Because you can set a really clear attention. Your conversation starts to change who you pay attention to and want to even converse with changes because you've made this switch in your mind and made a decision. This is what I want to attract. So there are two paths that I think that you could consider, and one is, potentially three, one is a consulting gig that is a profit sharing performance-based incentive that is decided from the beginning, so you're not arguing about it. it could be relatively small, feel better not be having a hot flash going on. Okay, then pause is awesome. Anyway, so it isn't about necessarily how big the percentage is, but it's that that there is a growth opportunity, right? Because then the onus is on you is to leverage that. And you can potentially either reinvest some of your earnings into somebody that so you're barely touching it. And that's an engine because it's an engine for you because you brought it because it will keep making money and then you have a person that helps you with it. Like I've been telling you I want you for sure to be using other people's time and talent a little bit more, but first we've got to get you to the money where you can really do that. So that's one version of it. Another one is a you know a profit sharing partnership, but not with somebody old. this is not an ageist thing because some people can be really old and just really just like they're they're still at it there's there's all kind of things but I mean like old in their heart just like right you know like it without fire let's let's put it with that somebody who has fire in them for the stuff that they're doing and maybe they hate marketing but they love their products love the market love but but don't love marketing you know there are lots of those people they're really good at fulfillment and they may be good at marketing but they hate it and they or they also have come to the realization that they're splitting their time doing something that they're not efficient at and can make so much more money so that is the thing I really think that you should be kind of super powering your magnet for yeah Somebody who's very energized very excited and has a profitable product who just realized that They are ready for you know a full-time marketer and can pay a base pay plus performance So your original EHR isn't going to be very high, but your job is to do some really good marketing Research and to see that you're willing to put some skin in the game and go I think that if I put these split tests in if I Created this order bump if I created this continuity program if I Make sure your list hygiene was really good and improved your inbox, but I don't like that's a whole lot of stuff Mm-hmm, but you know, and so it's an investment But that's how you explain to them and justify why you're going to give me this percentage Because there's this is a lot but you really need to make a list of these are all the things I'm doing. This is Each one of these are expert level full time jobs. Do you understand that person like that I'm talking to you? These are all full email, like list manager, full time job, affiliate manager, full time job, marketer, full time job, copywriter, full time job, right? These are expert level things, and you can do all of these things, or you can hire somebody out. So either there's a budget for it, so it's not coming out of you and you make that agreement, to begin with, but either way, I think that that's super leverage, gets you into some exciting stuff, and can keep your EHR around $250 or better. For sure, better would be great. Cause let's do some quick during math. Hold on a second. So if we did, if we had you working at, go away, what is this, these camp? called you base camp. Bye Felicia, hold on, kept you here later. turn 50. I can say, turn 50. the truck times 30 times 4 equals $32,000 a month.
00:36:08 - Chris Mason
River and months, yep.
00:36:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you worked 30 hours a week at an EHR up to 50. So if you cut that in half, and it was $125, then it's $15,000 a month. Yeah. the thing about that is you could easily have $5,000, $10,000 in paying other people, really great other people in any of those departments, and have them split across multiple partnerships, right? Yeah. Where they're really happy, that's the thing. Where do the numbers look amazing? Where you're not stressed out, where your brain isn't the only one on the things, because that is a huge bottleneck. That's if you get sick. if whatever, so many things, right? So you're leveraging by having multiple other people. If you have a copywriter, but you don't have a marketer, guess what the copywriter is also? They're a marketer, you know what I mean? Marketer, not the copywriter, guess what they are also. know, like there's overlapping skill sets. So in terms of like giving a brain a break, or giving your brain a super boost when you get to talk to those people and they give you an idea and you're like, oh yeah, that's awesome. And it's just part of their job to do that. So this is where I think that you're at, Chris. And if you, I don't know where you're going to find them, but I think that if you just spend a lot of time, we were talking about it in 2020, building your network. I want you to be so much more intentional, intentional. What the crap is with my brain, intentional bowl? That's not where Tina knows that. Anyway. Keeps talking in the third person psycho. Okay. really reaching out and looking for people like that who have amazing products, who are still fired up and excited about their stuff, and who aren't talking about. We're going to 10x this year and blah, blah, and making those really crazy statements about these arbitrary goals that are just about getting attention. You want to see that they're having conversations about life is all about family. At the end of the day, this is what matters. So you want to see value statements from them that show that they have a center and a compass that is not money. You also want to see their language being about appreciating talent and really lifting other people up. Like create the avatar for your ideal partner. What do they look like when they're talking in social media? What kind of emails do they write? What kind of videos do they make?
00:39:02 - Chris Mason
What is their language?
00:39:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you will profile that type of, like Jeremy Weiss, always lifting people up, always about his family, super smart, loves the stuff he does, always enthusiastic. And super connected, he may know some of these people. And another thing that you can do is you can do a tiered commission thing like, hey, man, you got these connections. I'll pay you a referral fee if we do some business. I'll even pay you a long term of referral fee of like 5% of whatever I make. So not whatever the thing makes, but whatever you make or 2% or whatever. So you just be like, I mean, nobody pays me. I make connections all the time and you're going to pay me just to introduce you to people. You know what I mean? Like, play differently, but pay to play so that that everybody gets blessed, um, and it's not about, you know, manipulating or anything like that. It's just showing gratitude in a currency that they can use however they want to.
00:40:13 - Chris Mason
Mm hmm. That's an interesting idea, um, because I'm working with him now on this podcast and you brought him up. was like, yeah, he may know somebody, but I mean, heck, he may also be that somebody I know.
00:40:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like him. I think he's an amazing guy. I think the two of you have a lot of synergy chemistry, like, um, synergy was really the word that I had the chemistry was that for sure too. Yeah. Do you know how God be working? He just like pops things in. Yeah. wasn't an accident that that's the name that popped in my head either.
00:40:53 - Chris Mason
Like there's a lot there.
00:40:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's interesting. That's aspect of it. Like he's not going to meet Chris Mason's, Chris, you're very special. I've told you that lots of times, but your values and your quality, your integrity, people aren't just going to find that. How many people like me have you ever met?
00:41:17 - Chris Mason
I don't know. Not many, if anybody.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Never met Chris Mason before. You know, and I can't say that of everybody. There's a lot of people I'm like, yeah, I know few of you. And they're the people that are idolizing Grant Cardone. What's his face? I want to say Vinny, like my cousin Vinny, but that's not it.
00:41:45 - Chris Mason
What's his, he drinks wine, Gary Vee, Gary Vee.
00:41:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, Gary Vee. One of the two of them kind of in the same boat.
00:41:50 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're not that unique to me. There's, there's, there's other ones of them. And it's the grand grand grind, money, money, let me, motivate you but really my stuff isn't just not together and it's like Gary V looks like like like the emperor on on Star Wars. Brad Cardone's doing a video about hustling and grinding in the hospital when he just had a heart attack and his wife looks like she wants to slap him upside the head.
00:42:23 - Chris Mason
He just had a heart attack?
00:42:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, this was a few years ago.
00:42:26 - Chris Mason
Oh, few years ago.
00:42:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah, yeah, no, but he was like, you can't stop me. I'm like, you're the poster child for what not to do.
00:42:35 - Chris Mason
Oh, I remember that. Yeah.
00:42:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like, my nurses are mad at me and I'm looking at his wife out of the side. And now, but now she's all, you know, she's all big and she's in front of, you know, she's got her own following and everything. And so, of course, she's gonna toe the line and play the role. I'm like, anyway, so you bring in not just like you know all your marketing skills and business skills but you you come with a compass that matches just a very small group of people and especially in your age bracket because it takes a while for people to realize that money is not everything you know so that's one of the reasons a lot of the older people are more drawn because they finally figured it out but there is a generation of people that are like they got it from the beginning they're like oh what no this is crazy anyway so Jeremy Jeremy's connections anybody else that you might find through there build out your avatar and make sure that you have a base pay if there's an existing business and it can be relatively low but that's their skin in the game with you because you're going to put your time in they're 100% going to get a benefit out of it And, you know, you can put your time elsewhere and they can say no, but base pay, minimum of 2,500 whatever a month plus performance incentive. And then your job is to start acquiring the types of people that you would need, whether they be an automations person, which you've already got that infusion soft girl. So you might be able to do some things for you, several things for you.
00:44:24 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Potentially a media buyer, junior copywriter, graphic designer, not top of the line in cost, know, optimized leverage kind of people that don't charge a lot, but then you kind of give them incentive to be like, Hey, that did amazing. Here you go. So they're really happy and they're loyal. But I think that that is a good play for you for a while until you've made enough money that you can start putting in investments and getting your money to make money for you.
00:44:59 - Chris Mason
Yeah, I mean, that's So it's like, the thing that I, that I wouldn't want to think about, what is it that I want, is like, well, just want to pile cash away and, and be able to have revenue coming in through from investments. And, and when I think about that, was like, you know, by it, because I really like working. Like, I like singing my teeth into something, into a project. And so, like, if I had that, I don't feel like I would not, it's not like I would just sit around. No, I'm fine.
00:45:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then you could be a really high level consultant if you wanted to do, or just a profit partner consultant. You know what I mean? Not an operational consultant like you are now. I think you and Seth, and maybe you, Seth and I, should do something together.
00:46:11 - Chris Mason
He... Oh, Seth.
00:46:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Now, the difference is he's not making money, and so it's not, this would be, this would be one of those things that you feel like called to or don't, but what he is working on now is teaching people how to create trust and use trademarks to basically protect yourself against government theft. But given the state of the economy and what we all see the writing on the wall, whatever, you know, I think that there are extremist levels of that, and then I think there's just not preparatory levels of that, but I think that there's a life on all the, you know, the family compass, the liberty compass, the hard-working entrepreneur that I love my nation, but my nation has a lot of issues, compass, you know. So, but he just had a baby, his wife just had a baby. Marketing is not his thing. You could do it in your sleep. He can teach the stuff. He does a lot of research. He has very high-level conversations. And he's got millionaires at the Wazoo that just love him and trust him immediately. There's a lot, if YouTube became good friends and really talked a lot, I think that there's a lot of synergy there as well. And I would love to be part of that.
00:47:57 - Chris Mason
Yeah. I mean, I like Seth. have a really good conversation. with them and I don't think like they're all I'm in them through you and so yeah I mean I'm totally open to that like I for example like one of the things that that I there was a guy at the grocery summit that I didn't get a chance to to speak to but he was talking about this infinite banking concept which I mentioned to you for a long time ago this way to use whole-life insurance and yeah I have and I wanted to meet him and I just it would have felt anyway we didn't get a chance to talk but he was he's teaching that concept for Jim owners and I've always been attracted to that taking that idea working with somebody who's an in that and in setting up those those policies and I mean, you've got to love to hear about that, too. Like, I could get, if you get your insurance license, which is not that hard to get, then you can earn on the contract, the policy contract that somebody does. And so that feels like a really motivating message to me because it's like, man, because I see how it works. And my missing piece has always been like, I'm not the expert to talk about it. I don't have all the credentials behind my name, and I'm not a financial, whatever. So that would be both a good partner for me and a good industry. Yes.
00:49:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm interested in you should go back and have that conversation. I'll go back to stuff, too. He almost pretty much doesn't like to work, but that's not it.
00:50:04 - Chris Mason
The work that he does is learning.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's having high level conversations, so it's learner teacher, learner teacher, that's it. But he learns the most high level types of things and he wants to teach. He wants to teach everybody. So buddy marketing operations, so like I would be all ops managing all the teams, making sure the money is taken care of, making sure he stays grounded and doesn't keep, because he will jump around a billion times classic visionary, you know, but you can't take the good of somebody and not take the bad, like we've all got our stuff. So I think if you were willing to, like I would just do some work until it made some money and we'd have the parameters, but I wouldn't be getting paid. My money will have to come elsewhere, but I don't think there'd be a lot of time in it. But what I've watched him do time after time is he makes a post, a millionaire's reached out and want to give him money. So you can't do regular math and regular predictions working with people like that, not working with people like me either, working with people like you. mean, your math has been regular, that's because you've been playing in other people's playgrounds with their rules. But you are, and I've told you this repeatedly, nobody shows up as consistently as you do. You are a rock. You stay on top of your game and you're always helping people, which is two things. One, you just get the benefit of the gifts of but also that good karma, God is out there blessing you in ways you don't even know it. And just helping you through things because You're just always taking care of people. So anyway, I will all set up a three way chat. Probably he likes telegram. Are you on telegram?
00:52:11 - Chris Mason
But I can be.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't what's up. I don't know what's up to you. I think but because it's owned by Facebook and the conversations that we're having on Facebook is super spy. They just are like it was crazy because Dexter had this experience and I'm like, I'm telling you I've been telling you turn off your messenger microphone because he's had profiles of people he was around playing poker with show up and he's never been around those people ever. And I'm like, I like, I promise you it's listening just it's that one app. So because they own what's up and they're talking about end to end encryption, whatever. I'm just, you know, whatever.
00:52:53 - Chris Mason
Okay.
00:52:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah, if you can do telegram, if you can telegram send me Can I say we'll connect all connect us with Seth and then we can have a conversation about it because again, that's a long place. So you have to control your time limited a little bit. But I don't think it's very difficult because you're part of the conversation to me would be offer creation. You know, and that's just an idea. Then Seth has to actually create the content. And my job is to make sure we're okay, let's create the framework and make sure all the stuff is there. Find the resources whatever manage that type of thing. So it shouldn't be a burden. It's not going to be big and fast, although he's probably going to need something big and fast, but he's good at doing that. Anyway, that's his burden. Our burden is make our money. You have to make your money. We would do this together. So just keep in mind it would be something that you need to compartmentalize. Anytime you do anything like that, that's a passion project. You, you got to keep it limited. No matter how it excited. is somebody else gets, don't feel obligated to do more than is prudent to do. Don't outpace anybody. Don't care about the project more than anybody else does. That's just kind of my rule of thumb. I will not work with anybody who I care about their business more and I show up more consistently than they do. I'm like, I'm going to pull back because that's just a recipe for resentment and failure ultimately. So don't do that. Okay. So just to recap everything for anything with Brian, I think that you should just think about all the things that you would want to do and do dirty level of work would be. And I also think that you should repurpose as much stuff as you possibly can. creating those offers. And can you repackage that people have said no to and offer it to them as like vault access at a lower price so that you're getting money out of people who have never paid you but are on the list who have definitely raised their hand with interest but said no for whatever reason why did they say no was it a price? Can we survey people like what are the actions that you can take to get to to extract more out of the existing assets that maybe you've been neglecting because you do book camps and you do TXL and you do everything else like let's really think about extracting from what we have and leveraging what we have then if it's thinking of stuff to do with Brian um a real conversation with him about how are you going to show up and and what you need and just say okay here's what's on the table in every single one of these scenarios it can be done so i need your full agreement, either one that you will show up on number two, that it is okay if I do it and you are not going to go back on the, well, I don't want you to do it by yourself kind of thing. Okay, so either you're all in and you will do it, or I get to do it, but we are not saying we'll do something and not doing it again. Then get what you have a good conversation with Tim, like really meditate, ponder, pray, however you want to handle it about what's on the table and be willing to walk away if you're not respected fully and honored for a time. Don't be afraid that you won't get more of that. You know you will. You know you will. Talk to Jeremy, just nurture the conversation, find out what his goals are. What does he want to do? what's he not doing that he wants to? What likes him up? Like really get to know him because he spends all of his time talking about everybody else. Talk about him. Like what's going on, Jeremy? Um, and then, uh, see who else is around and see what's on the table and I, and biggest thing is in the back of your mind, always $250 an hour EHR, keep that in your mind and do the math and figure out how can I make this happen? can go down to $125 an hour EHR because we did that math. That's $15,000 a month at 30 hours a week and 30 hours. We know that you'll work that and not be burned out, but we really, really, really want to shoot for that $250 with everything new that comes in unless it's the passion project and you limited to maybe two or three hours a week tops. That's, that's what I think.
00:57:46 - Chris Mason
Okay. Yeah. That's, um, did we record this?
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Could you send me the recording? Yes. I had the note taker come in, so yes, I will send it to you. Okay. It didn't, it wasn't at the very beginning, but I think when we started getting into it, I realized it and turned it on, so.
00:58:05 - Chris Mason
Yeah.
00:58:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:58:08 - Chris Mason
Thank you, Tina.
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're always welcome. Good to talk to you.
00:58:11 - Chris Mason
And let's see where we are. guess I'll talk to you in a couple of weeks, huh? Yeah, I sent you a text on my telegram.
00:58:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool.

So anyway, um So and then we're gonna have them complete like I'm gonna make a little road map image for them that once they Get get on that they get you done Aaron Fletcher stuff No, no, okay. Just curious. Yeah, but but you know what I do respect him a lot I've saw it when he and Frank heard of their stuff I think I bought something at Aaron Fletcher's literally 10 years ago and you know, know he's a cool dude I found it overwhelming. think one of my friends bought his stuff and she showed it to me. I'm like My brain just got like overwhelmed Yeah, and actually there's a lot of gaps in it.
00:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:02:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so anyways, um the reason why I didn't want you it's so funny because it's like oh now There's this thing. Oh .

Oh okay wrong Great. Let me I'll bring that over here. Oh, it's like this big. And you to read it that was.
00:04:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, so you know I see your desktop and BSL school.
00:04:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hermoji dot text. Oh, that's it. Okay, I'm sharing one on desktop.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there we go. You see this now? Yes, ma'am. Now I see.
00:04:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, now see you too. Yeah, that's our one. Okay. So my this is my old YouTube channel like if I go. Videos and not if I go oldest 15 years ago.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But here's all these people testimony. So I think I'm going to just use this one because he's a YouTube address. I started a new one because I haven't really used it much and these are really old videos and most of them were just embedded onto a sales page. For testimony of sales. He's like, you know, if you had like 10,000 subscribers and you barely had any activity on it over the last like 10 years. I'd say, yeah, do new one, but I kind of like how you've gone. Like a little bit of subscribe for her one, but I kind of like how you got videos from like 15 years ago Because then yeah Yeah, credible. Yeah, so so then I showed them then I was looking at this and I showed them some of the VSL is like offline consulting Oh, I like self-incorporated. but my business off the money mind map cash flow So this is like look at all this is so cheesy You know what works works. It's yeah, it fascinates me how The humblest videos just work so well. Yeah, so I know these videos I could show 13 years go 30 Yeah, but these videos brought in like in in my You know warrior form whatever I have like half a million dollars of sales 30,000 customers of just $17 $5 $1 dollar little information products, right and showing you've been doing micro offers a long time yes yes but also here's the the aha moment most always had some kind of VSL and you know this is what I upgraded and made a little video studio my background and downstairs like yeah dancing all that stuff your energy is one of my favorite things about you I love it I'm a bubbly girl and yeah I'm just like she is vibing that's my girl yeah yeah so so here's the thing two big things so the aha moment this morning when he's like oh wow you know lot of views over these videos what is that so well that's really like a VSL for on the sales page you go speed sells huh because you realize that Alex Hermoni just did a training yesterday because once a week Alex Hermonci goes and does free training within the school games and he was training them on how to do a proper mini VSL that goes on your about page and if I were to share the right desktop now desktop to if we come back to school, right? So about most people have a video here. So, so like, if you go, don't search, I don't have to go here and search, discover communities. Okay. so, I don't know, is there a VSL here? Yeah, see if she's got a VSL right here? Alex Hermosi just because they have access to all the school communities, right? He said that when people have a VSL on it and also work on improving it, it makes up for like, it was a crazy statistic. I'm going to go grab it from that video, but it was something like, like more than double, like maybe 300% higher conversions. If there's a VSL here. And as you know, they're, they could do Maybe every three minutes, they can be 10 minutes long, but the point is when I was showing the guy in India's name is Harut. That he's like, you're back on the experience and I love micro offers and we wrong, but there's a huge need to to done for you or help them with VSL specifically for your school community.
00:08:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, this gets into the conversations we really need to have, which is to go through your values and really think about your time. So there is this much time that we have, right? But it isn't just about time for money. It isn't just like there has to be fulfillment, excitement, joy, all these things. So one of the things that I was talking about is I love hybrid work. Okay. have so I have an Etsy store that I barely touched, but when I want to be creative and I want the outlet and also because when you create a product and Etsy, stays there forever.
00:08:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'll just randomly get sales.
00:08:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I put things out there that are in my heart, their spiritual things. or funny things but funny clean things and it just stays there there's almost no cost to it and I've only been doing it for and not even whole year but I know that I'm going to want to keep it and I will just get random sales it's not a profitable business but it is one that it fulfills a need and an outlet and I enjoy it and I am okay with it breaking even honestly it could be a loss and still be beneficially beneficial for me tax-wise because I don't have enough investment so then I have my high-level thousand dollar an hour clients and they keep my sauce sharp I have to be on my tiptoes all the time I have to stay on the cutting edge of technology I always have to be thinking about them looking for leverage so it keeps my brain very very sharp to work with these businesses because they want to invest and show up and not have, you know, results every week. And I love doing it. And it doesn't stress me out though, because I have the benefit and especially because of how much I get paid to choose my clients carefully. And they just bring me people that are good matches. I had my attorney gave me a doctor gave me his wife. He's having me work with his wife. Like what an honor that it's just amazing. Anyway, so it's fulfilling. It brings me joy and it's super high level. But my mama heart, my I have been bankrupt from divorce. I have raised four children on my own while this narcissistic threatened them and hurt them and threatened me and hurt me. And I struggled so much. And it almost broke me emotionally. I almost broke my babies and I created this freedom to be able to be home with them all the time. And when they started struggling in school to rip them out of school and say, we'll do it our own way, they're not going to give us what we need, come home. We will fix it. We will do our own thing. when you want to go back, you go back on your own terms and you know that when a teacher or a principal tells you act right or else, you can be like, I got the or else right here. I got the or else. And so now I have these amazingly empowered children and I want that for other moms because they don't have, like I was born with fire. I was born with retaliation and I was born with a brain to be able to create solutions from the time I was an infant. I am not normal. And I can't give people my strength exactly and I can't give them my brain exactly, but my energy is contagious. I can give them fortification, people do feel stronger when I talk to them and they are smarter when I talk to them and they are clearer and they don't have to be me. I give them something that when it attaches to them it's part of them forever but they can't afford a lot so but if I did only that you know I wouldn't be that part of me that wants to operate at the high level she would she would languish and that part of me that wants to be created and put God out into the world on t-shirts and hats and things like that she would languish and so I have all of these things and so while you're creating your offers now here's the thing we have all the time we have until we're not here anymore right there is no urgency unless you can't afford to pay bills. Yeah. So we get time to figure things out and it doesn't have to be perfect. what I think that you should think about is what sparks joy in you first of all to create and to work on but second of all to give and to deliver to someone else. And what kind of people do you have joy serving? What kind of people maybe pay you more money but just leave you feeling dirty afterwards.
00:13:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of those. Yeah. Yeah. And you know when I did some of this too since I last talked about what past things you've done but also I think over last month and looking at it and like it really came down to still being like I really do love crafting like giving birth to these finals. Like I really do because there's so much creativity in it, right? You know and I do enjoy working. can't really take it. side. I do enjoy working with beginners that take action and do it, right? But I hate it if they're the ones though that are stressed for money. It's like, oh my God, Marie, I gotta make money with this or else it's gonna, I'm not gonna be able to say rent, right? And I do enjoy working with existing business owners. Like that was in the joy belt, if you sell stuff, because some of the little take of funnels, power graphics, some of them, I'm like, no, you need to do a VSL, like one guy's that I'm dealing with a channel, a great guy, his dad's a doctor, runs these wellness anti-aging longevity clinics in Vegas, and has a real thing like, you know, that people go in and use that. So we're making little take a funnel for him, like, well, he's got to be on a VSL for doctors' white coat. So, but I enjoyed crafting his VSL for him, like the words, the script. And part of it, yeah, I was chat GBT, but a lot of it was also in my mind and looking at all the stuff. So that's where I kind of thought about the done for you VSL type service, because it's great. creative and it's done in a day for someone rather than like these little ticket funnels as I'm your client of mine can take like now instead of today's months for someone right. So and when I did this exercise a while ago, kind of a Venn diagram of my skill sets, people I've worked with and made money for. And then the third thing is, what do I really enjoy doing? It did still turn out to be working with women, typically they're over 40, typically they already have an audience and they have some kind of form of expertise. And I kind of just help accelerate like put gasoline on their business and accelerate their sales. sometimes it's not like I'm kind of full stack. Sometimes it's not a low ticket funnel. Sometimes it's a it's a free challenge, right? that then goes right to their $1000 course or their high ticket thing. So it's really, I guess it's just babying, birthing, a new marketing. If I had to summarize it and one thing, it's birthing, creative or innovative marketing campaign that gets them sales, builds up their list, audience and builds up their sales. Because you know what, I was looking today, the challenge ads that I created, because it takes a lot, as you know, brainpower to create something that really works and test it to get it working for ad copy. The product boss that went from zero to one million the first year and then one to four million second year, now they're probably at 10 million run rate. They're, I think it's the fourth year now. They're using the exact same ads and. I'd copy from four years ago when we first launched their challenge four years ago today. So I looked at, because they run it every, they run the challenge every September and October, rock your holiday promotions. And then in January, we have a different challenge where it just is more about how to grow your product based sales. But it's the exact same ad. So, you know, they almost got like a franchise in a box for me, like it's everything. And like, they didn't even know what kind of course to sell at the time. They didn't know what to say on video. So I did VSL scripts for them too at the beginning. But yeah, I love being innovative, like with my ads, with the creative, like I had Karina take a picture of you with a pie, a piece of pie, right? and now we're doing an ad that says, Hey, would you like a slice of the, you know, X billion dollar, you know, e-commerce pie, with my black lab, I have a burnagetal now, but when I was like, wow, I used to do videos with putting a pink bra on on on her back when I was walking her or just for something different for a video.
00:18:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:18:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And then so then when I do webinars, okay, the game here is whenever you see the pink bra, one of my slides is like the Easter egg hunt or whatever you call it. You know, someone's gonna win a prize. And so when I was teaching that back then it was go to webinars, Zim didn't exist. If someone the first like I'd then have a big bra baby on the right corner of one of the slides on the 15th slide, whoever said pink bra first, comments, one like a, you know, $50 on gift card, you know, just things like that.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think that we should kind of create this thing with with all the offers, all your products, all your income generating things that you have, even if they're old and they're still on warrior form and I can't. Usually they make sales. I think that we should figure out what your first of all Do you know what what your monthly expenses are just to live and exist and operate as you do off the top of your head?
00:19:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's really not much like 3500.
00:19:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so do you have steady 3500 a month at least income?
00:19:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had up until last week when the whole breaking off with Karina And all that stuff.
00:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so what are you going to have next month if nothing changed?
00:19:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If nothing changed, I would basically have Like almost zero, but okay, I am changing stuff right because right what had happened just so you know So you know how giving I am and how stupid I am Um like there you are Yeah, well about two three months ago. said to Karina Why don't we just combine to both our businesses everything's 5050 so all those little ticket funnels I sold she got half of that right? everything. I know. Yeah, that's why when like, I need to get over because it's the past and it's not a lot. But all the funnels that I helped her make over the last seven months are assets. And I have had her hire a VA and how to find the right VA enough work, who now is just contacting people because she did a two step post in the 5,000 Facebook, she's making about five or 600 a day she doesn't want to split anything with me.
00:20:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to help you with this. And we have to figure out the words, I don't know enough to be able to say what needs to be said right now. But we're going to let her know what she is going to give to you. you don't need to back it up. But I promise you, if I help you with the language, she's going to believe you in terms of like what kind of legal stuff is going to happen. It's not going to be a big, long battle. There will be probably a little bit of confrontation and words, but I can help you all want to know all the details, all the numbers, everything, and then we're going to say this is what you're going to give me, and it's going to be assets, not money. don't want money. We want assets, okay, so, and you can say, or you can give me a very large amount of money or we can go to court, and here's why I'm going to win very quickly, and here's what I'm also going to sue you for, legal fees and everything else. You're going to scare the crap out of her. That's what's going to happen.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Listen, just let me go ahead and finish.
00:21:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're going to in your heart know that you'll take less than what you're asking for. You just need to have some of your assets assets back.
00:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And even you don't So my daughter was about to eat the cats, okay.
00:22:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It isn't about wanting to fight. It's about standing up for yourself and not repeating old cycles of letting people take over. Now we don't, it's not bitter. It's not angry. We're not going to use bad language. We're not going to intimidate. It's going to be way more respectful than it sounds right now, but it is going to sound. But the energy behind it is going to feel so strong that it will feel like, who is this person? It's not going to be bad, but you need to practice, Maria. This is what it's about, okay. This isn't about bitterness. This isn't about war. This isn't about retaliation or anything. This is about you having muscle memory of saying, this is not okay. This is what I'm owed. This is what you're going to do. And I'm going to stand up for myself. So we'll find something that you're comfortable with, but please let me help you have that experience, because here's what I know. Not only is it going to help you, but you're going to now have some new level of experience in handling people that you're, I know you're gonna give to other people. You're gonna give to other people every time. You see somebody in that problem, and you're gonna be like, look, this is what we're gonna do. And we're gonna take care of it. And we're gonna stop having these amazing people be victims of other terrible people who take advantage of them. And for their sake, but also for the sake of who they serve, because we're sorry. So when we're hurting and we're suffering, because somebody has hurt us, we don't get to serve as well. So even Jesus went through and cleansed the temple, like he was and peaceful all the time. But you came into his father's house, and it was Whips. cracking tables, turning cast out. There is such thing as righteous anger. And when you defile the home, you had a home, you had a business together. And she, that was dishonest, that was just to be like, we're just going to parkways, and I'm going to ignore you, and I'm going keep everything.
00:24:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's not Cass and Stone yet, because basically I called right away, and she said to that, I said, well, no, that's not quite right, because, you know, we've spent a lot creating a lot of disasters. of them were hers at the beginning to exist with, but I took her from average order value from $60 to $100 and more. But I, and I said, and I also put in my sales over the last two months into it. I'm just burned out, and I own Facebook, like, I started with 30,000 debt, which I didn't tell you when you first came on as 5050 partner. And I now owe them 7,500. That's why the ads have been turned off for the last two weeks. I just need to get out of debt and make back stuff, but why don't we just revisit this in all fairness because I don't think she's a bad person. She really isn't. She just, she just said, I'm just working out. Let me just see what I can do to drum up sales about ads running. And that's, let's then reconvene, whether it's in one week or 30 days and then let's talk, you know, because from my perspective, I think she'll be reasonable if I just say, I want all the list that grow grew since I started because all that money that went into ads. that's been about 10,000 a month. We made more than what we spent on ads. because you decided stop doing sales calls isn't my problem, right? you, know, that's when the sales always started dwindling is when she no longer wanted to do sales calls. So yeah, and then I would probably ask for some sort of percentage of the sales in the future or maybe just an agreed amount that she still owes me and that she pays it over time. I don't believe she's I really believe she was burnt out. She really was she is in debt. she's never lied to me at that part, but it's just it's whenever I started asking for all the financials because I want to get more granular detail to make better business strategic decisions. That's when she said, Oh, I don't think this is going to work out our partnership. I still to the state never got all the financials, so I know I have to walk away and I'm okay with that, but I'm not okay with I just see like away with nothing. Well, I see just see $2,000 of sales come in the last four days all organic using the VA that I had her go higher and using my go high level system that's from my friend that she's using the contact everyone via social she's using all my intellectual property to continue making this money. So once she gets the Facebook ad debt paid off, you know, I talked to one of my other friends and she said, people when they're in a corner will act and do stupid things even dishonest.
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So sure, and it isn't about thinking she's a bad person, but we still don't get to abuse other people because we're in pain.
00:27:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. so, but if you have a plan, I just don't want to see you just take it. And giving people grace, for sure, that is something the Lord would have us do anyway. grace as much as you can give grace, but also, we have a requirement. And this is the requirement. And maybe it's that you control the money for a while and you're like, I'll take 10%. I've never been to Psalmist, so I will take it and I will give you the money and you can control it because clearly by your own admission, you can't manage the resource as well. If you want, we can have a contract and you can hold me legally accountable. I have no issue with that because I know I'm not going to take money or mis-match it or anything like that. Whatever resources you have, if you want to take things, then rebrand it and just be like, okay, you get a copy, I get a copy, I get the list, you get the list, we're going to do this, whatever, like be creative and think about what would make you feel good knowing that you handled her with grace, the grace that you would want to have given to you if you had been in that situation, even if you would never be in that situation, so that you know you feel right with God and what do you need to feel like, okay, I at least have something I've worked very hard for and maybe I've paid a price for not requiring proper accountability, not having proper boundaries and so this is going to cost me and I will pay that cost and experience but this is what I should have moving forward, so I think that you should get really clear on whatever that is and think about what you control and be smart about that, be willing to use what you control with the grace.
00:29:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right?
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
come off strong and powerful and hard, but it's always like I intend to have grace. And I just want to make it clear that I am not going to be subject to what you dictate. I'll be subject to what the Lord dictates, who tells me a lot of times. Come down Tina. I'm down.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. No, no. And you know, you're right. My fault too, that shouldn't have shared the revenue that was for my business with hers. I just really thought, hey, this will keep things going while things slow down in the summer. And you know, she was traveling a lot on vacation because she has yeah, I think, but yeah, part of me was like a little upset too, because it's like the fall is always the highest sales month for her niche, like how to start a boutique. Because You sell based on get ready for Black Friday, several Monday sales, that's when you can make 10,000 days, you know, but at the same time, it wasn't in my heart to continue always selling how to start a boutique and helping with that, because I feel there's better models online, like if my best friend came to me tomorrow, Tina, and said, I just lost my job, what should I do online to make money? I really want to do something remotely. It would not be started with clothing boutique dropship. And so I think that's why the sales also went down, because I realized over the last three months, my energy wasn't as much into the business anymore.
00:30:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Margins suck.
00:30:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You've had experience with good margin businesses.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For me, with the Etsy store, my friend is like, yeah, yeah, I'm like, I can't get excited about 10 to 20% margins, and you really have to work hard for 20% margins, and then I'm involved in it. cannot be excited, but I can be excited about having a little passive engine that gives me some joy. But like you said, and especially... in this economy right now, that is not where you start. That's where you maybe expand and branch out if you want to. But yeah, anyway, so sorry not to take over.
00:31:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, it's crazy. And I think that's why she needed to make that decision for her own too, because she knew my heart wasn't in as much like she sends out. So that's why I'm saying it's the end result is yeah, I just want to have a fair agreement. And also that we do still, you know, because I do consider that she became a friend, I just know that over the last few months, you know, she had that financial stress, I wasn't even aware of that she told me about so. Yeah, it's hard to end.
00:31:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sure you know what that feels like I think we've all been in a place where whether it was money or relationships where there was something we're like, I don't need anybody to know that that's hard. Not everybody like you hopefully have somebody that talked to But so I would love and I've got time and I've got energy. would love to come up with a plan, especially knowing that you need to generate some revenue. Really, honestly, every chance we get, and we could be talking on it through Boxer, I would love to figure out. So when I'm working, now, I only have one client for the last, I don't know, eight years, who's ever been in the situation of I have to make money. Well, too, everybody else is seven and eight bigger businesses. But I have had plenty of opportunity with the two to really have to go through these exercises multiple times over. it is to figure out what your assets are, including those connections, who would, like, if you put out an offer that is, say, 500 to 1,000 or if you're going to do the DFI, mean you could get your You could do that for $5,000 for the right person and then your your month is done And you're not overburdening yourself with so much work that you can't have enough time to build the smaller offers That are easier to sell that you can sell in your sleep because you know that system really well And in the meantime, you're also sharpening your saw again and refreshing your memory on a VSL on all the market research that has to be done on the language on the system, whatever, and If you happen to be documenting your process as you go, I can't remember What thing I don't think it's descriptive something where If you if it watches your screen record, it will turn it into an SOP Which then you could use as training for the done with you or the do it yourself ESL. But I remember when Ryan Dies first did his split testing on VSLs.
00:34:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And because he always came back with his split test results. And this was like 13 years ago. And then I also remember the first time he did a split test on three pay. And he noticed that there was like only like a two to five percent dip. If you tripled the cost by turning it into a three pay. So like if you had an 80% conversion rate, we'll say 30% conversion rate at $2.99, you would have like a 28% conversion rate at three payments of $2.99. It was insane. I don't know that that still works because the customers are so much more savvy now. But especially in NIM. For sure. I mean, TikTok, Instagram, all the video channels tells us that people love consuming videos. Old school videos where you were trapped in a victim. Now, the conversion rates, because I've also worked with conversion fanatics when they were brand new company with Justin Christensen and Manish Punjabi. don't know if you know who they are. But anyway, statistically trapping people increased conversions. But my premise was that it decreased retention and increased frustration. So the other thing is you have to decide our conversions. The ultimate goal is brand reputation, which ultimately leads to more referrals and leads to happier customers that stay longer, that will tell their moms and their dads and their cousins and their brothers about you. I mean, is that more important to you? So, for me, it's not the conversion isn't the end all be all but it's the quality of the conversion and the quality of the retention that matters and so that's a way that you can stand out in this crowd and be like conversion isn't king but retention is and satisfaction is because of that referral and whatever so you know in terms of like standing out for people like did you ever you know watch somebody teach you about marketing and you felt gross afterwards because that's how I feel about almost all of it but then did you ever watch somebody go for marketing you're like I didn't so I love I can't wait to do that I've seen that happen too and there was a that I mean there was a polar opposite yeah but the these ones over here be like I make all this money but I've been behind the scenes and so have you we know how much hustling you do we know how much lying you do we know how much quitting you do we also know how
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's for you've been. We know that you've been almost bankrupt multiple times. We know that you have partners that hate your guts because you destroyed everything and it almost cost them their families if it didn't cost them their families.
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't want anything to do with that. We want this. So these people might make less money, but I bet you they keep more money. I bet you they have less stress. bet they aren't popping roll age 24 seven and getting the divorce than having ulcers and heart attack like freaking Grant Cardone. Yeah. Whoa, I'm grinding. just had a heart attack, but I'm in this bed and there's my wife looking disgusted at me. He didn't say that, but she was looking disgusted at him because he was in their hustle, hustle, hustle, blah, blah. I'm like, you're an idiot. You're an idiot and you're bragging about being an idiot. You just like, please don't. So anyway, you have a beautiful mama bear. Don't be just douchey kind of gift to give and there are so many women who are like, I can do this, I can do this, and they're going to be so excited to see this. Now, there are women, but here's the thing. Also, a few years ago, and then five, 10, 15, 20 years ago, when I was starting, you were starting, women didn't have money to do this stuff. The moms that we're working with now, they're like, first of all, I have to ask my husband, second of all, we don't have that much money. And third, I've got kids uniforms to take care of, and I've got all these different costs and things like that.
00:38:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Women have money resources now that they didn't use to have.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they can make these investments. if you want to get high ticket stuff, it has to be okay, you're qualified, and here's why, because you're already making money. I know that if you go spend this, you're not putting yourself in significant financial risk if this doesn't work. Because I don't want you coming at me next week and going, okay, did we break even yet? It takes at least six weeks on average, it can happen faster to get really good conversions to be able to dial in the audience, to be able to read out the apps that don't work, to minimize costs for higher ticket, right? lower ticket, it's not as long. But it also depends on your niche. then, you know, we want to test upsells and order bumps and all this testing and analyzing, that takes time. That's very time consuming. You also have to write all the follow-up you have to test that, you have to look at your open wrist, you have to look at your inbox placement, like the funnel is not just sales page, order page, page, page, like there's so many moving parts. And it's like, if you created a flow chart and showed them all of these things, first of all, they have to be created. But second of all, they have to be strategically created, they have to be researched. Then they have to be tested, optimized, nurtured, if you've never done this, you have no idea how much time it takes. Now the one thing I can do for you is collapse my 20 plus years of experience and I have been able to distill this most potent impact in a lot less time than somebody else can because I've got funnel after funnel after funnel after funnel after all these things in my head and all these test results and all of these things to work with. I don't have to go read a book, don't have to do anything. I can just look at it and go, I know this, I know this, I know this, I'm going to go research that assemble and that's what they're getting out of you but you're doing it in a way that because you care about integrity so you're going to help them show up with integrity in their own market, which these slimy guys aren't going to help them do, these slimy guys are going to tell them some practices.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, we're going to help you build something that you're proud of that you're not going to be embarrassed if your mom likes that, or if your children look at and it's going to make you money like we can't promise FTC, all that stuff.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But we can promise that you've got something workable and that if you already have an offer that converse, right? And you're just looking to leverage it and build a more solid solid engine, then what I can do is help you increase conversions and I'm willing to, you know, put my put my money where my mouth is, mouth where my money is, whatever money where my mouth is. And you can put in a guarantee, like if you and especially if they already have an offer that converts. And so you put them through this questionnaire, right? So get all their stats.
00:41:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And you and I both know most of them don't know their stats.
00:41:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so you say that the offer is contingent upon you validating the stats, meaning they will show you and walk you through it if you create the guarantee, right? So no guarantee is you don't have to show me your stats. Guarantee is you have to show me your stats. I have to be able to get access to the conversions and see it even if it's just you and me on a zoom call walking through everything and seeing it because you don't get a guarantee if I'm not guaranteed that you were already performing at this level. My guarantee is I can give you at least a 5% lift. Period. Like 5% but then here's the other thing is so what does 5% mean? Well if they're making $10,000 a month, 5% is $500 extra a month. So how long does it take them to ROI a few months? Depending on what you're charging them, right? No but let's say I get you a 10 or 20% conversion increase and you're gonna you're gonna drive for that, right? So let's say you do that well not necessarily conversion increase but revenue increase because then the other thing you do is you go inspect all of their assets and go, you don't have an order bump. I'm going to create an order bump out of your existing content. I'm going to rearrange your offer, change your price a little bit, whatever. So you're not just DFI VSL funnel. You also do marketing consulting, high level, because that actually makes the most money for you and gives you the best chance at conversion. Look, let me review your assets. Let me repackage something. Then I'll build a VSL for you, but an entirely different offer, because you and I both know everybody's leaving money on the table. They are not doing enough upsells. They're not doing enough complimentary offers, or they're trying to throw everything in this huge stack that overwhelms the screen, and nobody's actually sitting there and appreciating all the things. Whereas if you took something and said, this is $2,000, and they're like, no thanks. Okay. Okay. This is $500, and you get these things, and this is why they're so powerful. Oh yeah, yeah, want that. Okay. Well, here's these three more things, but it's $250 more. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Here's another thing, but it's $200 a month. But this is why you need that. Oh, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I told they want that. Guess what? You got your key, but you broke it down because I got you in an elephant one by the time you broke the elephant down. And now they got to make all these little micro agreements and go, yes, to that little thing. Yes, that little thing. Yes, to that little thing. now I'm not overwhelmed. I know exactly what I'm getting. I'm super excited about it. Yeah, we did business and you got a lot of revenue. Not everybody's doing business like that.
00:44:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know that.
00:44:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But you can, you can do that. Like you could do that in your sleep. If you could see somebody's assets and all the numbers, tell me your brain wouldn't go.
00:44:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know what we can do to make you more. Oh, yeah.
00:44:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally. In your sleep, right? So, um, So you can do that and come up with like, pitch that to whatever, just really break that whole thing kind of down for somebody and say, this is what I'll do. This is what I need you to get me. And this is what I'll create. And this is what I'll back up contingent upon. You have X amount of revenue, X amount of conversions, X amount of daily visitors, X amount of ad revenue. Right.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So traffic is a must existing traffic is a must because you can't be having existing conversions if there's not existing traffic.
00:45:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I need to know you have something workable and I'm going to be your Lyft expert.
00:45:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I love that your Lyft expert. And that's so true because someone in an SP plus, because I'm in that, I'm in Spanish B plus is 500 a month. And it wasn't his fast forward, but. Yeah, one lady approached me and she just paid me $500 last week for a strategy call and right away, I just said, you know what, you need to just offer this new thing for 297. You're people asking for it. Here's how you do it. You just ask if they're interested in email, you get enough yeses. Then you do two preteaser emails, make a sales page. Here's the copy from chat. She did it right there. And created the copy for said, go, go launch this and based on her stats. She definitely has an 875 person list, but most of them are low ticket buyers of her wellness PR bundles to other wellness coaches. I said, you should convert 3%. Like, and I helped her increase her email open rate deliverability as well. that call, it was a two hour strategy go. And so I said, you could make like $26,000 just with 3% conversion. So I'll find out for the end of this week how much money she's going to be.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's going to shoot tomorrow. Yeah. When she's done it, get her to give you a video testimonial because another quick way for you to earn some money is do so.
00:47:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and strategy calls. Yeah, well, and that's what I was thinking. I'm not stressed about it because I was going to launch a mini challenge next week, too, to my own list as well. I have a couple other people that wanted me to work for them. But I said, this was two months ago. said, you know what? Let me revisit this in September, in September, because I do want to take some time off the summer and spend time with my mom and all that stuff. So do you know Laura Catella? She's like, I've heard that name. She's the female copywriter. She's the wife of the famous male copywriter, Georgie Stepheye.
00:47:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's how I know her, because they are friends of a client of mine, Glenn Dotson.
00:47:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So she was introduced to me by one of my longtime students, Greg Gal, Ginger Sorensen, and she entered her math line, and loves it, and I saw Ginger's transformation over the last six months, just be amazing. But. Laura knows me as the low ticket queen as well, so she hired me for a strategy call couple months ago. So I helped her with conversions over low ticket funnels, but I said, you know, you really don't have anything piecing it all together. So she said, would you for 2500 a month in 10% of, I think she said profits, I can't remember those profits or sales, would you just take over all my low ticket funnels and optimize them all? And I said, let me think about it. Um, I know I could make her low money, but to me, I don't feel 10% is the right amount. Because why not just do that for my own offers? Yes. Yeah, but she's a great person to work with because of the influence she has.
00:48:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's really connected. I, that never works out for people. Almost, almost, almost never. Um, and when it does work out, it wasn't necessary in the first place because that person would have gave them all the connections anyway. Um, yeah. Um, so one thing that's what her offer as health stuff, right?
00:49:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, mindset. Um, Laura's is mindset.
00:49:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The girl that I'm helping this week and like last year. Laura was who I was asking about.
00:49:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she's all about mindset. She's a bit about cooperating, but she's now more to mindset. Like, like a Brooke Castillo kind of gal. the best life.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is why the effective hourly rate exercise is so important. And I would do it from your peak time. Like, what was your effective hourly rate at that time? And you want to keep it below that. So, um, if you knew, do you know her baseline sales numbers?
00:49:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because I, if we were to go into that agreement, I'll get all that data from her.
00:49:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So one of the things you could consider doing is reach out and say, okay, I'm looking at some, working with some high level clients right now. Um, and I thought since I was opening up this offer in the summers over, I would give you first shot at it. However, I do have some parameters that have to be met first. So you're positioning from, yes, you're reaching out, but absolutely knowing your heart, you're not taking it if we're not meeting some baseline. So that 10% needs to give you another $2,500 a month. I that at $2,500 a month within, you know, two months tops. Otherwise, it's not worth my time because I've got other higher revenue stuff. But really, I expected to be giving me $10 to $15,000 a month. So if I see that potential there, then I'm willing to do this and I'm not. If that's something you're interested in, then let's have a talk and let's see the numbers and work on it together. So you're still coming from a power plate. And also you're not, you're not bogging yourself down. But if it's. making any kind of money like that, then maybe you could get, you know, go into like Brian Kurtz's world and get a junior copywriter or Colin Therio's world and get a junior copywriter or marketing expert. We can hire people that we didn't used to be able to hire even before COVID. Like COVID got so many people skilled at copywriting and automations that you could teach somebody really well to how to do what you do. So they started and then you go look at it top to bottom and go, yeah, that's on point. Nope. Let's fix this. Let's fix this so that you can take on some high level clients and you're not really managing a lot like really training junior, junior media buyers, junior copywriters and full on just dev staff team, but they don't have to be expensive. The Filipinos, the East Asian people, the talent is amazing right now and the prices that we can get and they deserve work too. mean, I'm a global person.
00:52:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not just American. know what I mean? Yeah, well, I guess you've got to talk this morning. He was only $9.9 a month.
00:52:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how it's crazy. And sometimes you can get way better service because they're more humble and they just love their craft. And you know, and you get to help them rise up like other people have help you. So that's something to consider. Just don't put yourself in a situation of resentment with clients. So if you can think of an offer like, I'd be really happy with this because I know I'm not going to spend X amount of time. And if I want help, then I'm either going to say, okay, I want $1,000 a month budget for automation's copy, whatever else I want. If you agree to that I'm product. So that if there's a mess, right? there's a lot of stuff to clean up, then you're That's a lot of time and you what you're offering me isn't worth it I'm not guaranteed that you're going to stay all the way through it We can have a contract the contract is only as good as your effort and showing up the court I don't want to deal with any of that. So these are my terms. This is what I'll be really happy with You approach me to begin with Got this over and over again, and I've really been contemplating you know what I want to do with my business and where I'm growing and So I thought that there's some alignment want to give you this opportunity These are my requirements And again, it's muscle memory. So if she says no, you just like that's cool cuz I There's so many other things that you can do Well, yeah, yeah, like cuz this other woman if she does really well I quoted her two options last week.
00:53:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what if I want to continue this well, then if you just want me straight up run all your ads and and run all your funnels, including the copy for them, that's 7,500 a month, but that includes, that's limited one funnel a month. You can't ask me to do three different funnels, right, because that's not going to be achievable. But I'm going to do that. And that's what Frank Hearn's Chief Marketing Officer did, Brad, something Brad Bearden, when he left Frank Hearn's, and I worked with him on Duwell on a client. He had that simple business model, 7,500 straight up, but includes everything. Like he'd create a funnel a month, that's the front end, the OTO1, OTO2, everything, right? The client just had to come and, you know, screw up.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that price point works for most people anymore.
00:54:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, gotcha.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then I quote her, or 2,500 just to run your ads, 25. I have been watching every expert media buyer minus a couple who have just gotten so quiet, and they're just doing really big things, but they're not talking about it anymore. And to anybody, they are changing their offers. are changing their price points. It's because that works for an extent, but it's incredibly high pressure. The results that they want from you, the conversations that you have to have with them are not worth the price point. It is so much easier to lower the expectations to get a little bit of lift to spend a little bit of time, but then to not have to keep replacing clients because they want to keep with you because that lift compounds and you're knowing of their funnels compounds, so you have less effort every month that you have applied to it because you know, well, I just need to change this headline.
00:55:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just need to change this image.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is working. Okay. The hook is working, but I bet I could improve it, you know, the little thing. So the job becomes easier for you also over time. My clients last nine, seven, five, they don't go away, they come and they stay. and I do something different. when you're getting results, you've got somebody who is still using your stuff four years later. So if you obviously understand, and this is what I wrote down right here, timeless principles that have worked for centuries, that's what Eugene's breakthrough advertising is all about. The things that have worked always work. Human psychology has not changed for centuries for it. What do you call it?
00:56:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
A years millennia.
00:56:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are the same. We think the same. So you must for it to have converted for four years tapped into that.
00:56:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You must have tapped into that basic psychology that doesn't change, that timeless thing.
00:56:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's no other way that that continues to work, because it would have had to have been a fad otherwise or. Right. So the fact that you have things that can work for years means you understand. stand human psychology enough to create an offer that is going to speak to every human that comes across it, that had that need to begin with. And you can even still stand out in the market because of it. So you have staying power, we know that. So if you're choosing clients who are not like, I want 10x by the end of the year, and I'm going to pay $7,500, but you better get it together. And every other day, Maria, what's our sales life?
00:57:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Maria, why aren't I making more money?
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maria, blah, blah, I know you've worked with those people before.
00:57:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They saw. Oh, yeah.
00:57:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They saw life out of you.
00:57:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, there's never enough. Like, that's why I left the product boss over two years, even though it was like 25k a year, and they would buy me gifts like a Peloton bike and all that stuff. It was never enough. They're now doing like almost million dollar launches on their challenges now. And it's like, it's never like take a break. It's like, go, go, go.
00:57:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, what are we launching now? And you need to get out of that.
00:58:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I sort of have gone out with that, that's also why the whole thing with Karina why I need to know knew I need you something different because she was always like, I'd get a boxer at night, how can we make $5,000 in those three days like it was always like pressure pressure because she her daughter is a question horse jumper. She had to buy her $125,000 horse like she got her huge cost of living expenses.
00:58:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He had to buy her $100, right?
00:58:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not the dollar. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So that's sort of why I was going back to being an offer owner, right? And that's kind of why the school community teach them how to do digital offers, but then yeah, you're right. I looked under the dust and I pulled up my old laptop to fire up from 12 years ago. I had some really damn good products in the past. Like one is called Get Publish Mastering, you know, like teaching people how to get published on Amazon. Those are timeless things. I've got how to make ultimate consulting challenge was was the challenge that it led into to, you know, how to make 4K a month as a social media consultant, I have a lot of old stuff on the Warrior Forum still that obviously would have to be updated, but it's really classic. I've got video ads made easy, teaching people how to show up on video, all that stuff. So yeah, I've got a lot of things and that's why the community, I got, let me give some of them away for free just to start building up that community and then see what the market wants as well, right? Like, is it the VSL or is it done for you ads for $997 a month, you know, but it's only one campaign. They then want five different campaigns, five different funnels. Oh, no, no, the $1000 per funnel now, you know, like everything's manageable like that, you know.
00:59:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm good at domains. That's pretty good, or market mama, marketing, market, marketing, mistress, marketing master. You don't want to go mistress because you're going to get some filthy dirty people, marketing master Maria, marketing mastery, Maria's marketing mastery because everything you're talking about is marketing.
01:00:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So you love marketing.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. You love markets. You love market tours. You love business. You love commerce, commerce and marketing with Maria. Thank you. So if you have this overarching thing, right? So because one of the things is people get, and my guy is one of the worst of them. But he talks about people hopping around and jumping around from this thing to that thing. But a lot of it is all under the same roof. So like VSL's micro offers, getting books published on Amazon, that's all marketing. It's all sales, it's all marketing and sales, right? So if you have a brand, a main brand, houses all of those other little things that you love to do, it ties the tether to say like, I am still, like this is all one thing, right? But this is a branch that's come out of it. So if you have this home thing where you can have all these different types of offers, you know, on the main page, and this is...
01:02:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it could be Maria Godelis, of course.
01:02:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But in addition to it, you could have this page that is SEO-optimized, keyword-optimized, right? because it helps, because when people land on it, if they see the domain, they immediately know, oh, OK, this is what she's about. And that's the one thing that personal name domains don't necessarily give to us, and you could put all of those things there. Plus it also, if one domain ever has a bad email reputation, you can fix it, go to this one, if that won't get different type of thing. So those are some things to think about, oh, Maria's marketing mastery.guru, I need another one. think I did another with a dog guru, but anyway. What I would love to see you do, and if you do, and when you do, I know you're going to do this, if you, when you do some VSL finals, I think what you should do is just screen record all day long, everything you do. you're doing, it's going to take a lot. Use some sort of AI tool. Let me go find what it was real quick.
01:03:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Someone else brought it up on the ANHV.
01:03:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Describe it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So capture that and then you should have some training material that can help you with an outline and you're like, oh yeah, I can go talk about this, but you're not having to rework because you literally had somebody watching your shoulder while you were doing it. And then you could worry out some of those things and blur out and whatever. And so done with you could be, okay, I'm going to have you fill out this template and answer all these questions and then we're just going to have a jam session and I'm going to validate some of your ideas. While we're talking, we're going to go do some marketing research. you get to where you can afford similar web or something like that and go do some solid research with them. Yeah, yeah, little bit of keyword research. with them. And so they don't feel completely alone, right? maybe anybody that does that gets to come to your weekly, you know, chat session that you're doing, coffee with Mariana. So that's done with you. And it's much less. And you're only giving them a little bit of time, but the onus is on them to make it work. You're just having them get further faster than they would have alone. And the DIY is, look, you can't really afford a lot, but you can do something. Go ahead and do this. And if you want some feedback, upgrade to the D done with you, right? I'm joined the community and maybe it's a little bit less cost, but it's a monthly fee that you you do. I think you could kill it on these and these could be much lower ticket, right? The DIY could be super low ticket so that you feel happy like you're serving people. They've done with you a hundred or two hundred dollars a month. Um, you know, that's that it could be cause it prohibited for some people, but you don't have entire characters, right? Yeah. Show up. And also it helps make sure that you've got people who are actually showing up to your call so they're not empty and low energy, right? um, but the bread and butter would be the done for you for a little while while then you're spending the marketing money, building these up, sharpening your saw here, you're getting real time test results to tell the community down here. And, um, then you can, you know, expand to promoting all of the other things and just kind of building your marketing library and whatnot, but in the meantime, you're very active in the nothing held back and commenting on whatever, um, and you can have like a pinned post that be like, Hey, um, I am loving having these conversations. I'm at this point in my life where I want to be home with mom and take care of her. and I love talking to some more people. So here's my pedigree, my marketing pedigree. If you want to talk with me, here's my offer. know, you can get on on my calendar. This is the amount that it costs. This is how many slots I have available per week during these times and they don't get to see those slots until they page for it. So you're not just have everybody go, oh, she's really available, you know. And I am very confident that you could get all the money that you need to get by before you really desperately need it.
01:06:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I agree. Yeah, that's why I'm very calm about it. Yeah. Like, I even had someone like, that's what was weird. Like, you know, also, like, because I've been, you know, reading the Bible every morning and journaling for the timer off for 20 minutes. What's weird is Charles Kirkland out of the blue on Saturday said, hey, I think I have some leads for you for some dumb for you low ticket funnels because he's a friend of mine. We keep in touch Everyone's well, and then out of the blue mind you haven't changed it over because it's in Karina's ClickFunnels accounts But again, there's trust enough that I'm just gonna invoice her and she's paying you back out of the blue Someone bought my low ticket $10 for emotional state marketing course And there's an order bump on there for a hundred ninety nine dollars for one hour strategy session with me So there's like two hundred dollars that came in on the weekend Sale and I didn't know she bought it until she Facebook message. Hey, I can't believe you're having this offer It's so damn good. So I bought it when can we get together? So I'm meeting with her on Friday. So that's cool So yeah, got people like I mean, I was one of them. I saw you know, was like hell. Yeah, give me that Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, so I mean and that's a proven offer to like I know we say dumb for you VSL funnels but really Scripting the VSL is like a separate thing But I mean yeah, the low ticket funnels are there and there's definitely it definitely works when people actually then traffic to it. So yeah.
01:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to see you do some higher ticket, higher value stuff for a while. And then, you know, I would love to see you focus on this and this be as an aside, right? So hey, I'm doing this, but just for just you know, guys, I've got this for you because I know that high ticket can be really intimidating. It really triggers that imposter syndrome. And the truth is the only way to get rid of imposter syndrome is to just keep doing a thing long enough that people give you feedback and tell you what you need to hear until you finally believe it. Because I can tell you, you know, all the mindset coaches can tell you all the things. But the only thing that gets rid of it is experience and um, evidence, right? telling you repeatedly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. the only way over it is the only way to it is through it.
01:09:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I've made this for you. Now, I'm over here doing these things. But look, if you can't afford that, here's this for you. Plus, here's the community because I've been where you've been. And you know, people use that as a line, but that's the truth. I don't know what it's for you, but it is for me. Yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah. You've where you've been. And I mean, I mean, even now, right, like we go through these cycles where there's lots of money and then we're like, okay, life changed. in a new season.
01:09:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care about money as much. got to deal with this thing.
01:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, especially as women, we don't, you know, sometimes we're just like, I got to bear down.
01:09:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can't do anything else right now.
01:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, go through this thing. So anyway, but, but you want to make sure that you've always got what you need to never have to worry about money or energy or anything else, because you serve your people at the highest level and you give them the best service. because when you're not coming from a place of need, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? If you're suffering, you're not high functioning. So keep at the high level, make sure there's plenty of money coming in, but only good energy clients, smart people who really get it. So you know, it's not gonna be mega high ticket because those people have too high of expectations they're not, they're stressed out, their goals are disproportionate, their market. So then you have more money to hire other people to help you with the other things, to manage community. And build your own little company that if you wanna take the summer off, you take the summer off, you go play with mom, play with friends, go on cruises, go do a visit, Tina, that kind of thing. Do the things and have a company where you're giving jobs and employing other people. like you have all of that in you so like you can manage that forever and then you've got extra money for investing and retirement if and when you ever want to my brain never wants to retire but I may have to I may not continue so I want to make sure all of my investments are there and now especially we haven't bottomed out on the economy but when we do it's springboard and the reason it's a springboard is because of us it's of the market because of the entrepreneurs and you're gonna ride that wave build your stuff that is solid and it's all hierarchical right so you're serving everybody in the market from the bottom to the top you're getting a piece of all of that action but you're also giving and serving all of those levels of that market and you get compounding effective it just keeps building upon itself yeah it should sound
01:12:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's by you fulfill you and also make you good money.
01:12:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You let up marketing.
01:12:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I do. I mean, I live and breathe it. I like at nighttime.
01:12:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd rather watch a marketing video than, you know, mad man, you know, something. Yeah, I do 100%. I like the psychology books, the leadership books, like persuasion. I gave, there's this young man at church and he's a very nerdy redhead. And I love him. And I gave him the art of war, persuasion. Originals by Adam Grant, who, which is amazing.
01:12:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If you haven't read it, you should read it. Originals.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yes. One of my friends from church gave it to me. She had read it and she says Tina, I read this book and I got goosebumps because I, it was all about you and she's like, you're an original. like, I, no, I have goosebumps and I'm, what was the other book? Art of war, persuasion. I should have written down what I gave him.
01:12:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
48 laws.
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
power? No, um, actually, it was that's that is what it was.
01:13:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, what I was.
01:13:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't think I'd given up.
01:13:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, but that was it. That was the other one. And originals. How non-conformist moved the world.
01:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but I'd like, um, oh my gosh, I'll tell you like my favorite books are pre-suasion or per-suasion type books. Like, there's a book called Switch by Chip and Dan Heath.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like Misbehaving by Richard Thaler.
01:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, the psychology books. I never really studied copywriting, but I study psychology. And I've been, if I've been head to head with anybody on a split test, I win. Now I haven't been against an agora copywriter, but I know the way people think and I study it. Um, a lot. And so it's interesting because I can see the correlations and all the copy stuff. I'm like, you're just like, you're just teaching how to write according to psychology.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So it's right. Sure. Yeah, I got some psychology books. I got, well, is it Carol Dies, whatever she's got one, one also cyber psychosibernetics, but that's more marketing, but psychosibernetics by Matt. Yeah, Matt Fury took over it, but it was by Moltz. Is it Moltz? Yes, psycho psychosibernetics, maximal Moltz. Yeah. That's a good book. So yeah, no, this is this is good. You know, it's funny because I was thinking because you have corporate world experience, too.
01:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know how a corporation has a board of directors, right?
01:14:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I was thinking, like, if I build this out. Not if when I build this out, like you, because you're helping me and I haven't paid you anything, I know we're helping each other, but I still would like to give you a percentage of this company or the sales or the profits, know, long term, that you know, I don't know if you're like me, but you know when you birth something, know, it's, it's, it's kind of nice to actually also be a part of it growing up.
01:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want to cry. I, that is the other thing is that I'm working on. I want to have rough shared deals.
01:15:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
want to be part of something.
01:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to nurture it forever. I'm, I'm, I was a mom before I was a mom. We have, I think all women with a few exceptions are, and I mean that because of their hearts, not because they don't have children. Our mothers, we love, we care, we nurture, doesn't matter if we burn children or not. And I know that it's easy to say that because I've had mine, but. It's not because I would have more. I would have all the kids if I had the opportunity. But I've known so many women. have one of my previous clients, Francesca, she is a bold, outrageous lesbian, bold, like, she has to stand up. And I adore her and I love her. And she, all my profit drivers, YouTube, she left me a testimonial and she sent me message for my birthday to have a video of her ranch that she got three years early because we went through that exercise, that time exercise, and she's like, holy crap. And she knew what to do. Now, she'd been working with Dan for like three years and they split ways in a bad way. But yeah, that's different things than I do. She was not respectful to him.
01:16:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, okay.
01:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but she understood the math differently and she understood her responsibility in doing her. numbers and managing her numbers. so her dream was to open a ranch where she could foster children.
01:17:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Now she's teacher.
01:17:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And she got that three years and she's so happy. She is so happy. Now I am super religious. I'm LDS and you know like that my culture is very it's it's finally shifting people are realizing like you can't say you love Jesus and go around judging everybody like you you really don't know if that's what you think that he was about.
01:17:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you know like she's always rolling blunts and she's like oh whatever she's got an amazing heart and that's all I care about and she loves me and I love her back and um but this this this is the joy like we get to be moms and instead of maybe teaching our kids how how to clean the house or like cookies or whatever, we're teaching them how to be independent and how to bring their gifts to the world. And birthing that is good. So anyway, Russia, I want that in my business to my, my guy, he's a, he's an angel investor, like he's a big money is almost actually been an issue because he makes so much of it. And his thoughts about it are different in mind are in humble. And I'm like, I, I don't want that. I, I get that you come from this world of life, billions of dollars. I, it, it becomes an issue at a certain point where people are obsessed with it. I said, I don't want to lose myself to that. Cause you always be like, don't let people in your business, Tina.
01:18:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Don't, don't do it.
01:18:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like he's, I'm so smart and he thinks I'm amazing and do all this. he's like, don't let people, I'm like, I'm like, but you need to understand that. Letting people in is my heart.
01:18:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like I am a family woman.
01:18:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love someone I love. of them. And I want to share everything with them. And I will always be that way. And business can't be different. It is for other people. But that's why I have to be so careful about who I do business with. I will have very good contracts because people can change and they can go do. Generally, what will happen though is somebody else gets inside their head and tells them, Oh, and gives them the greedy talk. You should be getting this.
01:19:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You should be getting that.
01:19:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so then they talk the business because somebody got in their head and ruined things. now I'm not doing business with this person.
01:19:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm doing with person business with the person that's in their head.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Oh, can't hear you.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There. Got it?
00:00:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yep.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you now. How are you doing?
00:00:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm good.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you? Good. I was looking at your stats today, looking pretty good for August. Not bad, huh? Yeah. How do you feel about that?
00:00:29 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
It's pretty good. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think it would be hard to take all the credit. did, you know, work my team like a slave driver, but I'm pretty hard, but yeah, it feels pretty good.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do how do they feel about it? They get bonuses too, right?
00:00:54 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
reward them? Oh, yeah. They're pretty happy. You know, they're, they're. They're complaining that they're taxed on those bonuses. I was like, yeah, you get taxed on the bonus or I get taxed for all the bonuses.
00:01:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can say, oh, I could just keep the bonus.
00:01:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
See, that's how I would do that. My kids, my team, whatever. Oh, did you just say you don't want the money? I think that's what I heard.
00:01:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Do you rather not have it?
00:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, 100%. That's how I'd respond. I'm like, OK, can keep it.
00:01:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my gosh, man. I can't even sell the net attitude. I mean, I can. The tax is stuck, but still. Like, you can do not still make more money.
00:01:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't They're pretty happy about it overall. They're just, you know. Because in the past, I had their bonuses. I had just like Apple cash them their bonuses. And now I do it in the show. And so they're like, what the heck, you know, and I'm like, well, yeah, but yeah, no, it doesn't make sense for me to pay all of your guys's taxes on these bonuses.
00:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, it does not 100%. I'm glad that you're not doing that anymore. But a great job managing the team and you were feeling pretty down in the dumps in July though.
00:02:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
That was a rough month. July was a rough month. Very low settlements. I mean, yeah, our next got saved by a couple of big ones, but I think we ended up with like 12 settlements altogether for the month. So that was rough. My, you know, I wish my moods didn't depend on my performance. They do a certain degree.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still, well, the great thing about this is that you get a compounding effect of. all the things that you've been doing. And part of August had to be part of the fruit of July. So July was rough, but that was also part of the fruit of June as well. So we're coming in and now you've been not just working on yourself but working on your team and not just driving but supporting, organizing, prioritizing, and as you make it a practice to do those things, your level of awareness increases, their levels of awareness increases and that reward provided you really want to encourage them to look at the math correctly. So, okay, yes, you had to pay more on taxes. Just to be clear, would you rather not have more bonuses, like, you find a way to have the conversation because of what you want is that they're you're familiar with Pavlov's dogs, your friend's response. Okay. If the response that they allow themselves to have is I get a bonus taxes, that is a Pavlovian response that will continue to happen. So what you need to do is help them shift the response so that every time it's they do the math, okay, well whatever that bonus was so give me somebody's bonus as an example.
00:04:31 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So I think altogether Jessica made $400 in bonuses this month.
00:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay and roughly how much do bonuses get taxed differently?
00:04:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I have no idea. think Michelle just taxed it onto their paychecks.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah so you know let's say 20% tax, right? So was that $80? So She still got $320 that she didn't have before.
00:05:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, so what you really want to do is yeah, but after taxes, you still have bam. You know what I mean? Every person. So have that map ready for you in your mind for every single person when you pay stuff and they go say, yeah, but the taxes and you go, yeah, but you keep X every single time because you want the incentive to maintain its incentive power. It's the whole reason there. It's not just a bonus structure. It's an incentive.
00:05:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And I guess like, that's like, that's kind of what I want to keep going. Like I don't want this month to be this last month to be like, Hey, we hit goal. Great. know, now it's back to business as usual.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, business is usual.
00:05:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not in a standard, you know, like I want this to be the minimum required and. And I, you know, like, I feel like up till now it's been the plucky little Arizona team, know, just trying to, to be all grown up, like the other, the other teams. But now I feel like we're, we're hitting our full stride and I want to take advantage of that.
00:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me screen share some with you here. Because yes, um, so where am I at? Hold on. I don't want last night days. I want last month. So we just go ahead and look at that and enjoy how great that was. at that average fee by team. That 11,000 was really high because I've looked at all the numbers and that's not typical of any time period. Right. Um, and then gross attorney fees by team, you and Samantha were pretty much hadn't had last month. Yeah. Um, this is something that we need to work on big time and that's the thing I want you to use on your team to keep them focused on the fact that we didn't really knock it out of the park you know long term like that that was really a small moment it was great but this start to average 62 days longer than the other longest person so Samantha has the next longest time at 281 days this is definitely where the team pulls away and there's a very clear discrepancy right yeah yeah this is a number i'm very well aware of that i you know it's not something that i'm particularly happy about well i'm not finished let me let me go through here because it's improving okay So this, that's something to pay attention to. So watch this spot right here. So we're looking at, this is just for August, which obviously we know is, it's not a real good view, right? So, but 343 days now, if we go this quarter, watch that number change. 300, actually, we're going the wrong way. Let me do this, let me do this, let me do this. Last two years, let's try to want to do this. Okay, average days to close this one, this report didn't even exist. So 370 days, okay? I don't know if you remember where we were at last month, but it was 343. So we'll watch this change, last two years, we're going to go last year, not a whole lot of change, right? But a little bit, not a whole lot of change, but then we're going to go last. Let's see, last quarter. We're watching that drop. Now last quarter was actually better than we were last month, but the quarter is a much better gauge. And then we're gonna go this quarter. Come on, you can do it eventually. All right, let me refresh and see what happens. This quarter. Okay, 318 this quarter. So don't worry about the month because the quarter's a much better. So I'm just gonna do this one more time for you, okay? 318 and we're gonna go two years ago and look at where we're at now. 370 to 318. That's almost two months.
00:10:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
right? It's headed the right direction.
00:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is heading the right direction. That is important Lawrence. A two month difference is significant. Now, now, so we're going to last quarter. You're also closing the gap. So there's roughly not quite too, like a month and a half difference in speed between UN Samantha. Patrick's still an anomaly right now because of the cases that he gets or not, the typical cases, some of them are Mark's stuff. And Tyler is not the veteran to really match for anyone. His drive is very different. So this is something to also celebrate, but to keep driving, we really want to bridge this gap because that obviously makes an impact on how soon Sweet Lock gets the funds.
00:11:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Right. I'm also interested to know because I know that with higher limits, it does take longer to get to those limits. And I'm wondering how next year we'll look for the other teams when their limits go up to $30,000. Whereas right now, the policy limits are $15,000. So they, you know, Cairo and MRI, usually you can get that with just, you know, a good Cairo and some MRIs, and they'd be a recommendation from a pain doc.
00:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I'm wondering if their time is going to go up or if it's going to stay relatively the same. So is, um, gosh, that was my, I didn't want to highlight this one. I mean, um, Think about this for a minute. I won't. Where. That's me. You should already get there. I want my A. I know. There we go. Okay. So. And then we go back to let it. What are the different and policy limits for Arizona versus California?
00:12:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
California right now. They're at $15,000 for a minimum policy. Arizona's at $25,000 for a minimum policy. So it's a $10,000 difference, which we don't get to with just Cairo and MRIs. We have to, you know, usually we can pop those policies if we have above $15,000 worth of treatment. Unless there's a. you know, an anomaly like a broken bone or something like that, then we can demand right away and all that policy without too much trouble, which I imagine is the case for all the teams.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you know about Washington and New Mexico limits?
00:13:21 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So I know Washington and New Mexico are 25,000 just like Arizona.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't know. I'd have to look into, I'd have to drill down to see.
00:13:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So it'd be interesting to see the distributions between the cases, but that being said, I'm driving hard to reduce that number.
00:13:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you are. And so the whole point of that was just a reminder, first of all, that we're doing that.
00:13:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So we're on the same page. And also to show you that it is working.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you're doing is working, obviously. So what we want to do, and I'm going to move this away now because we've seen that, need to go look at my notes. Where's that from last week? So is to really focus on how do we maintain momentum without burning people out? How do we tap into intrinsic motivators for your team, which means you have to first identify them. And with your monthly conversations, that's the best time to do that. You know, understanding how big of a difference is $320 a month for somebody. Does it make enough of a difference for them to work hard? How much harder did they have to work? Do they have to put in more hours or did they just have to think a little bit better and get off of autopilot, which is what a lot of people do. They come in, they do the thing because they're supposed to come in and do the thing, right? Versus coming in and doing the thing the best way they can, because it's going to have the best results. So like you are motivated to compete, you're motivated for job security, you're motivated to not have to suffer so much by doing the job poorly or not optimally so that it causes more stress and more frustration, you understand that how you work has an impact on how you feel. Right, so if you have a constant uphill battle and you feel reactive, I'll give you a case in point, and which was a catalyst for me at like 21 working in a call center. answer the phones on average, right? Not every call will get answered in that amount of time. But on average, this is your number. This is how long you can put people on hold. This is how often you can put them on hold. This is how often they're allowed to call you without resolution. So basically, the resolution had to be within the first call. A certain percentage of the calls had to be resolved within the first call. like 90% something like that. So in 1997, the reports were gathered by Lucid Technologies. It was the phones. So the phones had different modes in them for answer the phone, for what was called ACW, after call waiting, where an agent would type their notes. There was a hold button, there was a transfer button. All of these things were able to be tracked at that time and generate a report that was like a DOS report. So if I say DOS, like Unix is actually really what it was. So I don't know how Intel, but they're so much smarter than that call center was, down there data, but they knew where we were all the time. Now, the people that worked at the call center and were operators of any sort, including most of the managers were entry-level people who got trained on the job, okay. Now, I live in an area where we rank in the top five in the nation for domestic violence, drug use, for unemployment. It's really terrible. It's a tiny little town. It's not a great people. So the workforce is not very good either. So there's a lot of really low-quality stuff, not great training. But I have a little bit of a not-average brain, and I really don't like being threatened. I've dealt with threats my whole life, and my response is I will flip it everything around. I will make it it mine and I will fix it because I'm not going down without a And if I'm going down, I'm going down swaying and harm. So we have getting threatened every other week. We're not meeting metrics. We're not meeting the metrics. Somebody's going to get fired. If I'm getting yelled at, you're getting yelled at blah, blah, blah, And I was 21. I'm like, man, I grew up with this in my house. I'm not having this in adulthood. I'm not having it as a job. It was stressful. People were constantly stressed, smoking left and right, anxiety. That was the whole dynamic in the whole place. And simultaneously, we get to deal with like technology. And I loved all of that. But then there was this stress. one day I saw one of my co-workers, the co-managers, I got promoted into management within six months of being hired there when I was 19. So I moved up really quickly. But again, there wasn't really hardly any training, kind of sink or swim, figure it out. And he was running some reports and he was putting it into a spreadsheet. And I didn't know spread cheats at the time. So I asked him a bunch of questions and I saw him use a formula and I'd never seen a formula. And so I doing what I do ask them questions, well, could I do this and this and this and this and where do I get this information? What I figured out was, if I pulled five different phone reports, I could figure out all of the different metrics that we needed, because none of them told us how we were performing according to the contractual metrics. There was not a single report that did that is ridiculous. So, but across five different reports, I was able to get the information and then I had to go and create a formula in a separate tab that drew from each one of these sheets in the workbook. And so, So, so basically one report gave me ACW time, one report gave me call time, one report gave me the whole time, write all of these different things. So then, and then one report told me all the different calls across all the time. So I had to go create a formula that told me what the averages were across that. It took me a while to build that, but from that, from that point on, it only took me 15 minutes to get our data. So what I did was, I just started getting my data every week, which meant I knew exactly where we stood every week, which means I didn't need somebody to come tell me my team was out of metrics, which by the way, they almost never were, because I was already running that proactively. The entire corporation didn't have a system like that.
00:21:46 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
They adopted my spreadsheet worldwide and other call centers.
00:21:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was 21, like it didn't and the business I'm doing that. How profoundly badly things get managed and people aren't looking at the things that matter most and they're reacting. They're not getting the information that tells them where they are and showing them where they've been so that they can see their trajectory and also so that they can see if I do this, for example, if I have monthly meetings with my team and I find out what's bothering them and I find out what they need and I give them what they need and I set some specific goals. Whoa, look at that trajectory line. You know what I mean? So I promise you that what you're doing, most people aren't doing. What that gives to your people, although it may be added stress to some degree, is a level of comfort as a result of the level of clarity. Everybody on my team always knew exactly. actually where they stood because they had their stats. They knew that they were safe. They were doing good. And when they weren't doing well, I trained them. I showed them how to do better. They never had to worry about their jobs. And I never had to worry about my job ever again. The only people I ever fired were people who didn't show up to work. Except for one next point, she her name was Cynthia. She just didn't have the mental capacity to do the work. She just could not. She was as sweet as I hated having to let her go, but I had to let her go. But everyone else was trainable, provided they had the information, and they cared enough to show up to work. Nobody had to be perfect. They just had to be steady enough to do a good job. And with the right information, they were able to do that. So my point is, is that by showing your people, your team, and giving them in criminal mental steps forward and finding out what motivates them so you know is an extra $320 like what does that mean to you does it cover your power bill and your phone bill like does it cover your car payment like really make it relatable to something like now you've got that money to go do this thing like is that too really awesome date nights is the concert like make it something other than a dollar amount that you know that they're interested in then um ask them well did you really have to work that much harder was did you put more hours in or did you just you know be more conscious and do the job and then a month or two later ask them like was it actually harder to do better or did you just change things a little bit and it and it really got you that result because some of it can just be like we make a mental correlation that says better performance is harder to work and takes more time and energy. One reality is sometimes it's just better systems and being more intentional on while we're at work, being more intentional on a call, controlling the call flow, keeping in mind that the end result that they really want is not to chit chat with us but it's to get their money and to get taken care of. So the truth is Lorenz, most people never have those kind of conversations with themselves or anybody else and they especially don't have those conversations in correlation with the data that shows them where they're at and where they're going. So clearly now, I can't say that there's totally a possibility that August was a fluke, but... I really don't think it was. I don't think it was. I think it was more than anything a direct result of your management. We will be able to see that if the trend continues to be that the stats are improving, not necessarily that they were the same amount of fees, know, attorney fees or average attorney fees as they were in August. the average time to close the case should continue to shrink even if it's by a couple days every month because that's a long runway to need to shrink. And if the average attorney fees don't go lower or there's not something where you can say explicitly, this was something completely outside of our control. So what I would love for you to do, let's see, meeting structure goals. So what I would love for you to do and kind of it takes notes where I can send this to you. But I would like, and I want to talk about Yuri, you've got Yuri to help you now, right, too?
00:27:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yuri?
00:27:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
am I wrong about that?
00:27:19 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know who that is.
00:27:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a new law clerk. I was thinking he was going to help in Arizona. Oh, maybe it's for Hank. I don't know. There's a new law clerk that's coming for a little while.
00:27:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Like a law student? Huh? Is he like a law student or something?
00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't ask enough questions about it and I should have, but we were talking about a whole lot of other things and it was kind of an afterthought that Mark told me in passing. But I was thinking he was on your team, so I have to find out maybe, maybe not. But anyway, so... But let's see, I gotta go to my document here real quick. All right, so Jonathan, Jessica, Vuri and Mike. Do you feel like you know enough about each of those to know where extra money would meet them happy? Something they value?
00:28:24 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I think John we're pretty close, you know, he's got a baby coming. Jessica has her wedding coming up.
00:28:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:28:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Mike, he's a young man on the prowl. He's always looking for, you know, extra money to go on his vacation, go on trips and things like that. And Vuri is a single mom, so that's easy.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All that extra school supplies and band trips, choir trips, whatever her kids might be involved in, uniforms, things like that. So what I don't know is the earning potential for your team in correlation to the cases. don't know. I would like to understand so like, what was the difference between July and August in terms of incentive pay for your team, each of them?
00:29:36 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Could you tell me that you have it in a spreadsheet or anything? Well, in July, they didn't make anything because we didn't really make anything. Right, okay.
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when was the last time that there was bonus pay?
00:29:48 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Before that, June.
00:29:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and what was it?
00:29:52 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
you remember?
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't. Do you track this in a spreadsheet?
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
The You know, because it's directly related to the money that we bring in and fees.
00:30:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really like you to do that because, for example, at the end of the year, you can say, hey, you got this in bonuses. job. Like, if you hadn't done all this work, it wouldn't have been worth this to you. Or, hey, these are the bonuses that we didn't get. You could have had X, that type of thing. So, here's a big assignment. I really like you retroactively to go back really through all of 2023 up till now and track bonuses for anybody that's still on your team that was on your team at the time, if that makes sense. So, let's do it with their name in one column, and then the month starting with January 2023 to February 2023 and so on, and whatever bonus pay that they would have received, and let's start with that and kind of look at it, just, when we see the bigger numbers, like, did $3,000 last year not make a difference to you, Jessica, or whatever, you know, if she did get it, or would it have not if, you know, if we got that? And here's all we have to do. This, this is a great tactic, but it works on us too. It's not really manipulation, but it's perspective. All we have to do to get that is X. We know we can do it.
00:31:40 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Why? Yeah, no, I can tell there's a different attitude. You know, the second half of July, second half of August, there's different attitude regarding the meetings or regular meetings, like, does not care for meetings, does not like them at all. Things generally, things are a waste of time. But he had to admit that ever since we started doing the meetings, we started getting more value out of those cases. mean, even along a lot quicker, too. So it was refreshing to see him on board with it.
00:32:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's another way you only have to, right? now what was Mike's incentive pay?
00:32:28 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Last month, it was about $400, dude, but he made a couple of case that he saved as a Spanish case, that was about to sub the sound, he saved it. So Mark gave him an extra couple hundred bucks there, then they have the firm incentive paid to the $500,,000.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when Mark or Mike complains about the meetings, okay, so how many, how much time I am how many hours do you think he spends in meetings each month each month. Yeah.
00:33:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So all of my meetings are always under an hour, it's never a meeting is more than an hour and usually that's about 40 minutes. So let's see. So we have them every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Monday meetings are shorter though. So that's one, two, six, eight, 20 minutes for those Monday meetings, divided by 60, probably seven hours meetings.
00:34:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright. Roughly an hour and a half week.
00:34:20 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:34:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know, I look at it. Really, he doesn't have to do anything else other than just improve based off of what you've learned in the meetings, right? Mm hmm.
00:34:34 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
So. His main complaint is that, well, we do these meetings, but afterwards, you know, we've got a long list of tasks that we have to do. And I'm yeah, that's. That's the point of the meeting. So we figure out what we need to do for each.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Very fine. Yeah. um, if you write the direct correlation to we need and what happens on the meetings, we have, we get stats. We get reports. like, here's where we're at. We get assignments. Here's what we can do to improve where we're at. And then you get a reward. Here's the money on top of your actual payment and wage that you get because you have a job. So this is just extra for doing the job you're supposed to be doing anyway. Yeah. That's kind of a fair trade, Mike. And like, say something a little bit playful. Like, I was like, yeah, me like, you know, whatever. And like, I mean, I mean, because otherwise, it's almost like you think like, people should pay you to do the job the way you want to and not the way it should be done.
00:35:44 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
But you're not saying that, right, Mike? no, that's silly. Come on. I'm not saying this is just showing up money, right?
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. nobody, nobody, I mean, no law firm is going to hire you just to come in and collect. to pay track and not care about it. This is a competitive industry. Why did you get into it? Now he's not an attorney, but he's still in a law firm. It is a competitive industry period on the story. Like if you wanted to have a job where you didn't have to think or whatever, like, good luck. Anyway, I don't mean we're going to get that, but you're not going to earn very much money doing it. And you're for sure not going to get incentive pay and things like that. But you know, it is what it is. And the other thing is, sometimes it's just the maybe there's a specific thing that's happening in the meeting that he doesn't like. And one of the questions could be, I mean, like, do you want to get better at your job? Like serious question, because some people don't care. And I'm like, right, right, right. So like, like, like, you don't like the meetings, but I'm pretty sure you're the guys. it wants to compete and like wants to be better. So really, the meetings are like our superpower. Like this is this is what we're doing. is where we're downloading the information. This is where we're getting the playbook. This is where we're figuring out how we're going to surpass the other team. get on board man.
00:37:18 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Get on board.
00:37:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know, everybody's different. The language is different. Their needs are different. Their drivers are different. job is to figure your people out. Figure out what drives them and be able to make a correlation between what the company needs and what they want. Because there is definitely correlation because more money does, know, money doesn't buy happiness. No, but being broke really is hard to be happy and you can't pay the bills, know. also the thing that you want to point out to them constantly is that technically and hopefully you're working smarter not harder not longer. I want you to go check the the law reports and check who worked when but if you made that difference without increasing hours worked you need to point that out to them. If you increase hours worked then we need to do the math to compare because July was not good enough was it were people not showing up or were they there but in presence only and not actually mentally. And that's life in that human beings and it can't always be helped. However if we continue to optimize our systems then even when people are not well we could potentially still get bonus pay because of the rest of the team you know working the best that they can. So you know off our one one for all kind of thing, like we each have our different roles, we each have our different drivers and your job is to know what those drivers are and to keep reminding them and to keep giving them the perspective to keep giving them the support and keep reminding them why sweet laws goals should matter to them. And that the dollar amount isn't the real value. Money is money. It doesn't do anything until you trade that money for something that really means something to you. You know, an amazing trip for Mike with the friends with the girls, whatever for very an amazing weekend weekend getaway. Getting some new gaming system for her kids or, you know, letting them be able to go on to some school trip. Whatever it is just getting door dash once a week so she doesn't. have to cook that type of thing like really figure out talk to them and try to obviously you know you can't cross certain conversational lines but you can listen you can just have conversations and really notice like what do they enjoy like you can be like so would you spend your bonus on like or i spent it whatever like because you can't probably i don't know like you would got to really be careful how to ask questions but um things like that so if you can figure out and then watch their faces and listen to their voices when they get animated when they light up whatever they're talking about is really important to them so if you can draw a correlation to let's say it's the incentive pay but also it's the incentive pay and you don't have to worry about your job very has job security issues you have job security issues not everybody does some people just they have this thing And now I'm where they're just like, yeah, whatever, easy, come easy, go. I'm not that person. Well, I wasn't. I am now, but I wasn't. So it's always a different driver for people. You have to know what it is. So if you can tell somebody, look, nobody is going to let go of somebody that's performing like this. Look how good you keep doing. And if you can show them their improvement, like I showed you yours, I don't know how you would measure that. So I definitely want to be able to dive into that with you. And we're not going have enough time to do it today. But I would love for you to think about how do you measure their performance? And do you have a system for tracking and measuring their performance individually? Could say how Viri was better in August over July? Would you have any way of
00:42:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
of quantifying that and well probably not I mean right now it's self-report I asked them to to keep track of their goals over the month and then to kind of report back on our next one on one but for me to verify and to track those numbers I can probably come up with something nothing else I can probably track it manually just from the the traffic on slack I would love for you to figure out a system for that if you can if it's really big then bring it to me let's figure out how we can make it worthwhile but every time I've asked somebody to create a tedious report
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The data that came from it was worth the effort. There's always an aha moment. I just did this. I have this one client, he's new, he for sure, so he has multiple businesses. He's a doctor, thought that one business was his bread and butter, made him the most money. Does not like doing the reports and gathering the data and organizing it, but no shock because nobody does, nobody does, but has a very kind of dismissive attitude about it. I'm like, you just pay me big, big, big dollars to do this. So you probably want to do it. And then we did it and it took five minutes. All he didn't even do it himself. I extracted the data and plugged it into his spreadsheet and you want to know what I found out that the business he's been working on growing but thinks is, you know, 33% more profitable than the one he thought was his main breadwinner. Had no idea. The one average. changes him about $2,000 an hour. The other one $3,600 an hour. He had no idea and didn't want to do the work to figure it out and the work took five minutes.
00:44:14 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What was that difference?
00:44:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a doctor, so he's got different types of ways that he provides service and he thought this type of service was the most profitable when really it was this one and he had no clue because he didn't check his numbers because it was a pain in the butt and there wasn't a database and nobody told him how to do it. Nobody made him do it. It wasn't necessary to do the job, but nobody works with me to just do the job. We work together to do the job optimally and optimize isn't just the most out of the least for the business's sake. It's the most out of the least for the person's sake, meaning the most results out of the least effort and stress and overwhelm. anxiety for the people who are doing the job, and everybody wants that. But most people don't think it's possible. It is 100% possible to be so much better at the job that you do now by a few little tweaks of fortifying systems, scripts, documented processes, and SOPs. There including just leadership, talking to your people, knowing what they need, knowing what drives them, and showing them how they can get what they want, and it's completely within their power, and also showing them how they can avoid the consequences they don't want, like losing a job, and how it's completely in their power. So, if you will figure out how you can track their performance and results. Now, this is not about micromanagement, but it is about the micro data. Okay, you're not going to go tell them. I notice you did you got to fix this little thing better. You're just going to show them the stats like I showed you. I'm not telling you on any kind of minute level how you can improve your your average resolution time. I haven't got a clue. You do that. I'm not going to tell you. I'm just going to tell you this is the thing. This is the impact it makes. And here are some of the things you can do to improve your team within that figure out how improving your team gets that step improved. Right. So you're going to do the same thing and say these are your goals. These are where you hit your goals. That means something's measurable. Something is measurable. Right. I'm trying to remember because I have your list on.
00:46:56 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I think I can come up with ways. It's just they're not going to be automatize, it's going to be like just manual tracking a lot.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you figure out what it is, you could probably narrow that, that, you know, manual work down. So it's fairly quick, but probably imagine about 30 minutes a week on reporting. Once the hardest part is figuring out what needs to be reported and where do you get the data? So in the beginning, it's going to seem like this is a pain in the button, it takes a really long time. But once you figure out where all of the data lives, and you create a home for it, is a spreadsheet with the relative data, potentially with some formulas that make a correlation to percentages, things like that, then it becomes easier and you get there faster and faster. And at some point, it might be something that you can outsource, but you probably don't want to. This is really important. This for you Lorenz, I'm going to tell you why it should motivate you. The clearer you are on their stats, the clearer you are on what you need to coach them for and how you need to support them. And when you're clearer on that, you get to your goals faster. Your incentive pay is improved. Your job security is improved. This thing that I'm telling you that has to be done manually, that's its power. So I'll go back to the doctor client. He was spending the majority of his time in the business he thought made the most money. What do you think happens if he goes from spending, what if he took five hours a week from the one he thought gave him the most money and that was at $2,000 an hour and gave five hours a week to the one him $2,000 an hour? That's more than $5,000 extra per month. It's almost, well, because it was $3,600. So it was, whatever, we'll say it's around $8,000 more, a month, week, a week times four, so 32. $32,000 more to shift five hours a week from one business to the other, now that he knows the numbers that he should have known and didn't want to get. That's how important this information is and who runs people don't do this. Look how much you grew your team, their improved their performance with the few things that you've already done. We talked for an hour a week, three times a week, that's it, we've had effectively about six calls. Look at your stats. You did it. at that. We had some conversations about what you might do, but in that six hours, I, you know, all I did was help you think thoughts. You did all the work and they did all the work. But that's the power of leverage. Six hours of this time together was that insightful, and then you went and took that and put it into a system, into a process, which went into their operations, which got you shocking results. I looked at it. was like, am I looking at this wrong? the data wrong? It was like, that's amazing. It was profound. Now, I don't know if you can maintain that because there are so many things that go into what cases you get, you know, all of these different things. But for sure, a significant portion of that results was driven by you.
00:51:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Well, yeah, I think that's what these calls do. They help me focus narrow down what will produce them the most results instead of like being overwhelmed by all the tasks that I need to resolve and more proactive about the driving factors that I'm actually going to impact the results most.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what prioritizing does and leveraging, you're doing all of that. So keeping all of that in mind, however difficult it is to figure out how to track the data, do your best to figure out how to track performance of each of your individual teams and yourself because you want to know what you're doing and the impact that it's having. So the things that have the biggest impact you want to give more of your doing all all time to. Same reason, right? Five hours from this business to this business was worth $80,000 a month for him. Over the year, that's $800,000 plus $2,160,000. $8,160,000. Crazy. I got to go do the math for him. Just let him know he paid for all his coaching that day. I got to go tell him that. Thank you. You're welcome.
00:52:25 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Big count.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes I need to do my own app and be like, round. Did you say?
00:52:33 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, my success is, is your success too.
00:52:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
suppose that's. I'll take that. I like to share. It's, it's my joy though because, I mean, when I know something that can help people, I want to give it to them. You're the same way. I know you are. If you knew something that could help somebody, help them be happier, help them be less stressed, help them take better care of their family. 100% you're going to give it to them. Just because you're also getting paid and you're also getting blessed when they do the thing because you told them doesn't, doesn't remove the fact that you would have done it for free if you'd have known.
00:53:13 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I care deeply about my team. I care about their welfare, I care. I'm invested in their long-term success.
00:53:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now I dream about my clients literally. I say prayers about them. And if I see people on the streets and they're talking about their business, I cannot keep my mouth shut and I give free advice. if people reach out and they're like, hey, can I talk to you? I can't afford you. Let's go. Let's just. So I get you. I know that. So remember that the things that you're asking them to do is for everybody's reward and benefit. And then you want their buy-in. You want that. You want to know and you want them to say it that that's what they want also. You don't want them to just say, okay, they'll do it. You want them to do it because they know the value of it. That's the buy-in. Because then they're going to continue to talk themselves into it. Otherwise, you have an uphill battle constantly. You have to keep reminding them. You have to keep dangling a carrot. You want it to be their reason for doing the thing. But in order for that to happen, you have to know what drives them and help them see that correlation. So that doesn't happen immediately. Sometimes it can. Sometimes you can get lucky and just have the right conversation. Sometimes you can be inspired. I'm always praying before calls. like, please help me to know what to say, how to guide things. I think a lot of times there's inspiration that comes out of nowhere. I'm like, I had this thought. like, where'd that come from? um, I think you're It's a simple thing. We're talking about the same things every time. Data, people, stats, goals, then the why behind it, how we can think things a little bit differently. There is nothing magical about what we're doing. There's nothing shiny, new, high-tech. You got to go scrape data and stick it into a spreadsheet. How long have we been using spreadsheets? It's archaic. But it's almost magical because then you go look at those numbers and you're like, yeah.
00:55:35 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
This is where I got to work. The resolution time is where I got to focus at my energy zone.
00:55:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in case I didn't ask it clearly, I do want you look at hours worked in July for everybody compared to August. Because if, and I know, people were out sick, but what we want to try to figure out is what is our capacity with the amount of time that we have. We want to be able to increase our capacity without increasing time because we work better and smarter, which means they can increase their revenue, right, their incentive pay, without adding more stress and adding more labor and work, just improving our processes. We don't want to be slave drivers and with crackers. We don't want to do that. We want to be optimizers. And I want you to use that language with them. I want it to become part of your culture is we work optimized so we can enjoy life. We want to get paid well. You want to go enjoy our life outside of sweet love, but also when you're optimized, you are serving your people, your clients that call you that are going through difficult times in their life, you're serving them as efficiently as they can be served, you're getting them in and out faster so they can get back to their lives and get back to some sense of normalcy after whatever they went through. So it's win-win-win all the way around and because of that, it's worth the effort. Now if somebody on your team doesn't care about other people, that's not going to work for them but I don't imagine you have that.
00:57:27 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Now they're all the people. I'm blessed to have them.
00:57:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah so show them how their effort doesn't just bless them but show them how it blesses everybody else first of all because of what's a team so we're not hitting the bonuses without everybody doing their part. So you doing your part makes us extra sure that Barry gets her bonus and Jessica gets her bonus and so-and-so right so you're putting that community value there. But also Hey, guys, when we get these things going and we move quickly, our clients are getting their cases resolved quicker, when we're getting that higher attorney fees or we're hitting the policy limits, we know that they've gotten all the care that they could possibly get and they have the best chance of surviving or just thriving after, you know, the traumatic incident that they went through, we're improving quality of lives. That's part of our job and the way that we support each other, we're improving each other's quality of lives, we're making working together more enjoyable and rewarding and the work that we do more enjoyable and more rewardingly. Where is the reason to not do this? But people don't think like that generally unless there's a catalyst for the thought. And that's where you come in all the time. Remind them who we are, why we're here. Let's go.
00:59:09 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
What we're doing?
00:59:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm looking forward to September stats. Well, what's team learning to be like, that's my boy right there.
00:59:22 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You know, I'm not as loud as the other attorneys, but I'm intensely competitive. I like numbers matter to me. I I've been competitive ever since I was, and that's the reason I went to law schools because I'm super competitive. so I enjoy getting big numbers.
00:59:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenzo's going to come in with a sneak attack.
00:59:45 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're like, oh, you thought I was the underdog. I don't talk trash.
00:59:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't, you know, get to the games and , but I. I love trash talking, Lorenz.
00:59:59 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Even when I'm losing, I don't care.
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's just fun for me.
01:00:03 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I wouldn't never guess that about me, right?
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:11 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Should have been a lawyer.
01:00:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the one profession I wanted to be and the only reason I didn't pursue it was because I wanted to be mom more and there was no way I couldn't have those two things competing because I would want it to be the best at both. And I want to be those very compatible goals.
01:00:32 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. That's a hard, that's a hard choice.
01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm working on finally finishing my psychology degree. And I think I want to work towards a PhD no matter how long it takes me. So I think that I can help more people that way with just with their mindset, know, and help them find the logic and the reasons and let them do their magic and be supported.
01:01:00 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
I did my bachelor's in and said to go to law school because the PhD were out to seem too overwhelming to me.
01:01:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm all down when my kids are almost grown so I'm like you know what are you gonna do with your life I'm just gonna learn.
01:01:15 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
You're the better person for it that's for sure.
01:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then it's just helpful it's fascinating if I had all the time in the world for sure the three PhDs I would get would be neuroscience psychology and quantum physics because I am and then all the languages and then all the arts and then all the dances and then all the instruments. Let me live forever. Right well do you have any questions anything that we didn't talk about that you need to bring them up?
01:01:49 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
don't think so. The thing that sets my goals for the month pretty clearly will be be working on those reports and figuring out I'd have to best correlate the firm's goals with their needs or vice versa.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So let me check. So next week is we meet together and then the week after that is, is you get your off week. So yeah, let me know what kind of reports you're able to come up with next week. So remember time reports, let's compare July to August so that we can get some kind of corollary data in terms of getting a shell to pull that up for me. Perfect. And then how do we track individual performance and just get the raw data and then what you can do, if it was tedious, show me your process when we meet and obviously if there's a way that I can help you kind of improve it. But yeah, it's a work in progress, but I think it's worth the effort.
01:02:58 - Lorenz Schuerch (sweetlaw.com)
And I think you're seeing that. I like it. Yay.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're awesome. It's so good talking to you. I'll talk to you next week.

Hello.
00:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. I had a horrible asthma attack today, this morning. You're just on the Great Week. Oh, dude.
00:00:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You didn't know.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The crazy thing is, like, I started, like, copying and gasping. My throat was closing up, but, like, the rest of my body, my skin was, like, on fire. I've never experienced that before. So, yeah, that is fun.
00:00:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it sounds like good.
00:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I might call from time to time. I'm sorry. It's exhausting, but, like, my brain is fine. Um, my health is fine. Yeah, it's just like, yeah, anyway, it's wild. So, um, but I, um, my brain is fine. Not mostly. I, I have struggling a little bit still to get everything. Um, notes. Hold on. I have them.
00:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How are you? Um, we covered, we covered you.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We covered them. But I am really happy with my mission and getting to do that. And that's been pretty amazing.
00:01:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Doing this genealogy work and getting to have all these like spiritual stuff. have won't hear a quick three minute story. Maybe three. Less than. So, the work that I'm doing. So, we do, we believe that, um, have always existed, like, the Solomon, the temple of Solomon, things like that. And that we believe in proxy work for the dead, because not everybody gets to hear the gospel and be able to accept it and be able to be baptized. in temples, work is done for the dead by proxy. So somebody else does it on behalf of that person, and then they get to choose whether they accept it or not. So, and then we also do ceilings of families together. in the Bible, there's a reference to Peter having keys, and that whatsoever he seals shall on earth shall be sealed in heaven.
00:02:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And whatsoever he loses on earth shall be loose in heaven.
00:02:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So ceilings can be divorced and families can be put together forever exist in the family unit forever. So, we do genealogy work to be able to do that, that temple work for families. So that they can be sealed together so they can be found and and have that work done for them. So our church has got crazy huge genealogy like Before ancestry was there we had family tree and family church and everything Anyway, this weekend last weekend. I was doing work for family. So my assignment is really short I'm just supposed to append records of parents to children that are they were already identified, right? So it's like a this spreadsheet and Because people have most of the missionaries are really really really old and really really slow And they don't have anything else to do so they kind of me and or and they do all kinds of things and they get off task So it was given a time limit of five minutes, which I follow so I'm really doing this anyway I was trying to figure out for this dad because he had a Polish name and an American name Which name I should use because all of his records like his census records and things like that were attached to his American name, but I felt like I should use his natural born name that was on his naturalization records. Anyway, so I went off to pray for it for a minute and figure out what I should do, but when I did that, I kept seeing this flash of all these other records that I had looked at like super quickly because I fly through stuff. And I was like, I had seen what I think was potentially duplicate records, which is really common of the mom and dad. And then I went back and looked at them and they had 11 children, but only five of them were on one set of records and six of them were on another set of records. And so I was only supposed to attach one child. And I just started bawling, like bawling, sobbing, could not control it. it was like, I didn't see things. I didn't hear things, but I had this feeling of like there's all these people and they just really really wanted to be together. But in order for that to happen, everybody's records had to be fixed. The duplicates had to be fixed. They had to merge together. Names had to be correct. They had to be correct, whatever. And so I'm like, okay, I'm just going to do this. And like, it's almost like they're all hovering over my shoulder. And I'm sobbing the whole time. And then I did it and I did the last lady and I got to the last lady and she had nothing. Like she hadn't, she didn't even have enough dates to be able to go to the temple, even if she wasn't attached to her family. And so I looked her up and I'm like, well, I'm just going to go see if you have a husband. I'm going to see, make sure you have everybody once I get finished with you. And I found out that she died being the head of household. So she died living with two of her sisters. They all lived together. So it was definitely a really close family. And I had no way of knowing that. And anyway, but as soon As I got done, I felt really happy and it was just a really, I'd never had an experience like that before, and that was just kind of amazing, and with some of the things that you experienced, I thought, maybe that was...
00:06:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
All right, so what you're doing is sort of like creating a record that connects the records. were like, oh, belong with each other, but you would never know that. Oh, that's interesting.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because we have census records, social security records, new You can't go change those, so you're like, oh, I'm gonna connect, I'm connecting these thoughts. Right, so like FamilySearch and Ancestry.com, they have their person records that are created based off of the existence of those like federal records, birth records, voter registration cards, military things. Yeah, so like there's all kinds of teams of people who like read those, oh my gosh, census records, I don't know you've ever seen them, but some of them... Yes. Yes, they're terrible and the voter registration things versus like all of that stuff is hard. So there's a bunch of missionaries that just go around and they spend all their time trying to read those records and so they digitize them. And in two weeks, we got 95 years worth of the work done. Yeah, I don't even know what it was. It sounded like a motor.
00:07:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I did not hear anything. I went away from my phone. Oh, don't do that, damn. I know. was like, what am I doing? So Denise's Italian citizenship project that I've been working on forever. They recently contacted me and they're like, we cannot find Margaret's birth certificate. Like, we can't find it. We don't think that's her name. I didn't know this until I didn't know this when the project started. So, Everyone in the family knew her as Margaret, but that was not her name at all. It wasn't her middle name It was none of her names her real name is immaculata Yeah, we we think her name is immaculata. I go it is I Just learned that they go. Okay, Then we can go get this record because we found that and everything else lined up But then what didn't line up was the name and And yeah, you're talking 1910 yeah, not only no, you know what I mean, and this is all in cursive.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like, yes Person and a lot of times they spell things phonetically, so it's wrong because they don't spell it all over the place Yeah, all over the place, right We I kept running into Joseph spelled different ways. I'm like really or the names are flip-flopped It's like a middle name Or they give the nickname and that's not actually their name.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I'm spending with their zippy even though
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got his name.
00:09:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He changed his name to Joseph. His name was never Giuseppe. But he called himself. Yeah. So in America, he became Joseph. And then someone just assumed, Oh, they probably mean Giuseppe. And it's like, nope.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
His real name is like a Jessup name, which is in between them. It's not Giuseppe. It's not Joseph. It's Jessup J E S E P.
00:09:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's like Denise's dad. It's like, Oh, I'm Nicholas Leduca the second. And then the son is Nicholas Leduca the third. No, you're not. Did you your dad's name was not Nicholas Leduca? Like, was it wasn't Nicholas, Joseph Leduca? That wasn't his actual name. And then I said that to me, goes, Oh, yeah, I know. I got the why are you why are you calling yourself a second? Because he wanted to look like, Okay, no one's no one's gonna stop you obviously.
00:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. So I'm don't
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Getting 12 hours a week doing that and it has been like making me really happy Which is great because also because all these old people are so slow and are they are people Are is it like people submitted? Hey, I I need this done for me and then No, so it's a it's a genealogy Database like are you familiar with ancestry calm?
00:10:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you're just saying hey this person's in the church Therefore we're going to do this for them No, no, no, no, it's everybody so think of ancestry. We have a site that's just like it basically It's called family search and we have a partnership with ancestry. So Because honestly our church has probably got the most genealogists the most genealogical records like But the closest one would be ancestry, but it started with Family tree maker which was called my art church.
00:11:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, how do we know someone? How do you know which records to work?
00:11:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do we know which records?
00:11:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? The work on like you're you're serving like, hey, this one needs to be done.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is that? Thanks for all. Yeah. So it's first of all, it has no bearing on whether people are members of the church or not. Because the whole point is that we believe everybody in order to be in the kingdom of baptized in God's houses, immaculate in records. Eventually, everybody's stuff will be done. But anyway, so sometimes they're found just because it was attached to a whole bunch of records we got, like social security records or an even at records or military records or census records. So basically every type of document and record naturalization records, like those, like that's probably how they found out about her name. Alice Island type documents. any time we get a document, every single person just gets put in them. So then they go through and methodically attach and try to find, well, do we already have some of your family in the database? And so they go through and AI goes through. Yes. Did you know one of the biggest revenue sources in my church is patents. The church owns a ton of patents like technology. It is so fast. When we ask for a change, it can get done within hours. No corporation in the world works as fast as those.
00:12:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's been a whole nother kind of lesson. I'm like, holy crap, this is so cool. didn't know this.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't know it. I did not know it. Go ahead.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? How would you like, you know, the things that we don't know?
00:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know. don't know. Right. Yeah. But it's one of the things I'm fascinated with. Anyway, it was just a whole between the like, you know, I was special side because we have those conversations and then I did not know that Denise was going through all that with her family. So anyway, oh, yeah, um, close to those docs, see them. It's just funny but interesting. It is. It's just the world is cool. Family is cool. The work to figure out family, especially when so many people are being pulled apart by technology simultaneously, they're being brought together. And like that's the whole polarization. Like people are either focusing on the bad or the good, but 100% the bad and the good are happening side by side all the time.
00:13:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Dark and shadow. I mean, shadow left all the time.
00:13:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Like Tina's having an asthma attack and almost nine, but also angels are visiting.
00:13:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, I heard a quote the other day and I was like, I'll never heard of that. But they were like, it was something like the the brightest light cat. That's the largest shadow. I was like, oh, wow, that is true. Yeah, I've heard that before. true. The thought about that. So it's like, there's the dichotomy.
00:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I've heard that. But I've never thought about it with the yin yang type thinking.
00:14:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally. Right. Exactly. Which is also literally white and black. Right.
00:14:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there is light inside of the dark always and always dark inside of the light. Yep.
00:14:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Totally.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Boop boop. and tittishy.
00:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.

Okay. now that we have had our whole spirituality portion of the conversation out of the way, let's go. All right. But it is the spirits that do the work. So let's do this work. Okay, let's start with another 71. So I can get an update. I'll rock it along.
00:14:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just got, I got Lucy working on my special project. Literally, I just scoped it out for him and we ended our chat. He's I've got it, but he's now doing my thing where I mentioned this months ago, right? going to create a user upon form, submit, make sure that they can. There used to be an issue years ago that I think is resolved, but I don't know where if you already had a preexisting user, like checking out with Wu was an issue. But I think that was like a early days, Wu, like, Oh, yeah. Yeah, we probably should make something for that. And they pretty sure they fixed it, I was like, just make sure that if we create a user on form, submit that user can check out without issue. Hey, we'll do the next step. I sort of sketched out the next step, which was it would be return the PGT tracking data into user meta and attach it to that user. these are on creation. If they're PGD, PGT day, which would be basically our UTMs, right?
00:16:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we, oh, okay, translate them.
00:16:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you have PGT campaign with new team campaign. But then we have some extra one for us that we lose to a different way.
00:16:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you've explained that before, but I forgot that that's what that was. Okay.
00:16:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
use user. If they become a customer, we'll get pulled into Metarick. And then when they're in Metarick, I'd be able to say, hey, what was their PGT basically lead data? what was their PGT data, which would be lead? I might haven't actually do that. I think I need to create a separation between lead UTMs, the PGT and then customer. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that, but first I just want to get, like, sort of the gears in place and start spinning them and go, okay, yeah, they're worth it, they'll together.
00:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does PT stand for?
00:17:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it'll stick in my head better. Performance gravity tracker.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:17:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, get back here. Get back here. Wandering dogs.
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bellers in the .
00:17:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's Bell. He's a wanderer.
00:17:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my youngest baby's name, so. It's actually Isabelle, Isabelleona, but I call her Bell.
00:17:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, okay, so I start calling her Bell, like it's easy, or B, with B.
00:17:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds like a damn thing. So then, okay, so they get pulled into my I reckon they become a customer and then you can go look at their lead data.
00:18:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, then I can run these custom meta reports. So what I want to get at is I think ultimately what will happen is I can attach meta lead, meta cohort, meta. Metric has purchased meta. So I can be like, okay, fill me purchases from Google, which would be, let's call last. I haven't really, I got to talk to GPT because it's not touch. They've actually done, they've done more than touch purchased, right? So it'd be like purchase attribution and lead attribution. I could be the way I go better. So I'd say, Hey, show me the purchase attribution that you have that says they purchase from Google organic. Okay, great. And then in that same view, I have their. need meta-exposed and be like, oh look, all these Google organic air quote customers really originated from Reddit or really originated from Facebook and specifically the quiz type, whatever, forms. Now that might not happen, but then I'll know. I think there will be a pattern in there somewhere. And then similarly, I'll be able to apply their cohort, right? So I've been collecting their cohort, post-purchase. So once their cohort is applied, I can then say, hey, go into the, have the meta cohort to that record too. And then I could go into meta, I can say, show me all the cohort zeros. And then look at that, look at the, all right, what was the purchase source of cohort zero? What was the lead source of a cohort zero? And start to figure out where these people are really coming from or where I think.
00:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I'm going to see it.
00:20:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's pretty dope.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long is it going to take most you do you think or to get you that set up? And then you have to collect data.
00:20:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, and then so once he's done. think I can go, I think I can go backwards. Oh, yeah. So I think I could. So anyone that has a user record. I'd be like anyone that's a lead and it's like you have a user right now.
00:20:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean your customer. Right.
00:20:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So in Ninja, I would say. Hey, here are all the leads here are all the customers. Okay, now with the now let's get all these leads. And then apply post like back apply their meta. And then I'd be and it'll be thousands of leads.
00:20:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be really cool.
00:20:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, wait. And then that'll be it. That'll appear. better within 24 hours.
00:21:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When do you think Moshi will be done?
00:21:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know, because the first go around, he's like, you can't do that. I'm pretty sure I can, but I looked at that six months ago. just now, I'm just chunking it out. I'm like chunk one. Create a user from a gravity form submit. Do not change the form. If you have to change the form, you have to tell me how it needs to be changed. And I'll tell you whether not I want to do that. So like, assuming, know, and he was like, okay, so if I take the notes, form a creative user, that's what you're talking about. Do that. And then as that user try to check out and make sure nothing happens. So I assume he'll, he'll probably be done with that within a day. And then I got to think through, then I'll look at the meta, the PGT. Like I was just doing this too. I'm like, what? is the meta? I don't know what the meta nomenclature is. Like it's, I think it's under school war. might start with underscore meta, then you can put whatever you want. So then I would just figure out my naming convention and say, okay, make this PGT that maybe run that by Norio, be like, hey, we integrate this into PGT somehow? Or just kind of go dirty at first, and then loop back around, Norio, which I'll probably do actually. So then once he gets the PGT applied, has a meta on an actual lead cement. I'll make sure that she's, well, that won't show up in Metarick until they buy. Well, so once he does that, then I'll go, okay, how do we go backwards? That'll be a bit of a, that's going to be a bit of a lift because there's no way to export all the gravity forms in one go. demanding they dump them all and merge them, it's going to be a bit of a pain in this. But it's doable.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and what we've learned is the data is worth the effort.
00:23:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting the good clear data is the way that you spank everybody else's .
00:23:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I don't know the answer to this, but I do know if I answer this, then I think I can do it.
00:23:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can skill with it. I want to show you something that we figured out, and you may not think that this is very cool, but I think that it's very cool. have to go. Are you, are you on a mobile device? I am now, outside with the dogs. They are very interested in this dude on the roof next door. Well, it doesn't look good on mobile, and I think even if I screen share, it's not, it's going to look the same way, but I'm going to show you. Anyway, turn it sideways. Please. Oh, that was weird. Oh, she must be playing with it because it does not look good on desktop now.
00:24:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dang it.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll never mind.
00:24:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'll show you later.
00:24:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I figured out, though, actually, I'll show you on James Wedmore because that's where I found it. Um, to do work with me. Okay, so where's my zoom to screen share? No, that's a bit. I did not know with this. There is sure. Let me know when you see this wavy movie line.
00:24:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What? I see the song.
00:24:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't see the wavy movie line?
00:24:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I do.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So, um, well, first of all, I was looking at different sites and I was trying to find something, um, I wanted to model for, because it's easier for me to get somebody to build what I want if I can give them a visual example of this.
00:25:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, what I mean by inspiration, Tina, very familiar with my level. Yes.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but what I like, first of all, is that I know that James attracts a lot of the people that, that I resonate with me, I should say in that way, that resonate with me. Um, I also think that he's very good at getting his message across and he's very just non-dushy, I think he attracts a lot of females, his vibe is just not not the whole, like, in your breaking up content so that it flows and you get, you know, like these big, big words, they're bright colors. It definitely seems to be attracting female colors. Ryan Lee does the same thing. And so, but there's, if I go to his home page though, watch because there's movement everywhere, which with 80D people really, which especially the women, it really captures it. So anyway, I was doing that, but this was really cool to me. I love that.
00:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This would be updated. Hey, buddy, this is such an own page.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what was it?
00:26:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
On his home page is the chunk missing.
00:26:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It says this, which it needs to be updated. Oh, I didn't even see it. That's hilarious. So, I was like, I've never seen this before. How does somebody do that as an image? And so, if I gave it to chat TPT, I'm like, what is that? Can you give me the code for it? Because we were looking at it. I was like, it said SBC. Yeah, but what's the image? It's not an image. This SVG is created through code. This weight is just code. And I had never seen that before. anyway, so I have not all browser support them yet, but they're pretty close. Yeah, and the way that we'll just do something else or nothing. Right. So she had replicated it here on my site for me. But then I said, I needed I wanted it to look. Oh, I told her to change play around with the shapes to see what other shapes that we could do. And and that looks terrible. But she did have it replicated completely. And like, this is the element or theme. Oh, yeah, I can tell. Yeah.
00:27:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So those his. Oh, is that what that is? We were in the bet money.
00:27:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I was guessing.
00:27:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so anyway, that's what I was looking for is trying to kind of do something like that. Oh, there's like a browser extension that will it's like a WordPress browser extension that will tell you all the deets of a WordPress site when you're on it.
00:28:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be like theme.
00:28:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's it called?
00:28:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I forget.
00:28:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I used to use it years ago.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it built with?
00:28:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, you can use that. I don't think they you the theme.
00:28:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
use that for just like, Hey, what's I just use that like yesterday for somebody His book like it was built on kajabi. That's why I was like, I don't Yeah, cuz it is from and it's probably WordPress and as courses are probably kajabi. Oh So the kajabi code is only on there because it's tracking or isn't using it to log in or wherever. Yeah. Oh Well, anyway, I just thought I don't think kajabi does all the fly in stuff with that blueberry element or Yeah, I that's what was really surprising to me. Oh, so then I went to see think if it because I was, you know, you know, I've been looking around for the thing to use and buddy boss was just too complicated for me to figure out on my own, which I don't need to do on my now own now because I got to go. But I went to, so I was just playing with all of these things, got all these accounts, I was like, what happens with this. So think if I gave it a paragraph that had all of my chapters and what they were about and, but it wasn't, it wasn't very long. And it's a I created all of the chapters in a module for me with a sales page, landing page, and an opt-in page within minutes.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I got catchy PT. This is the first time I've ever been successful with it. So I started, I lost the song. So I've written this song, I had like, so I just sort of, I just sort of finished the song. Now I'm going to take it into full production. And then but while I was writing this one I had this other one in my head I was like I gotta go find that one. I'm trying to figure out which one to do next and I lost it. It wasn't in my phone. It wasn't in my G-Drive. I'm like, oh my god I cannot believe I lost this and what it was was just me mumble singing over a guitar riff but I Separately what I do is like I'll do the mumble singing I'll come up with the melody or whatever and then I'll write all the lyrics in notes and in my notes I'm not doing whatever and Then I'll go back and figure out the riff and you know when I go start record it So this I had done all that I had like this version of me play like what I'll do is I'll take a Clip like it's a clip of me playing with someone or whatever. I'll go. Oh, that's it. That's that's the guitar part I'm gonna write over that and then I'll mumble sing over that and now So I'll have like the original just us playing guitar then I'll maybe I'll edit that down and then I'll Mumble saying over that into my phone and then I'll go set. I'll be in notes. I'll listen to it All right lyrics and then I'll be driving around like singing it in my head and I'll go. I'm gonna go right that lyric But I never go back to or I rarely go back to that mumble singing thing, right? So that one I was like Oh, I'm gonna go find that and I could not find I literally spent six hours looking And I couldn't find it. I was like son of a So I was convinced it was in Slack I'm like, I must have shared it because I know that I liked it. So if I liked it, I would have shared it. So I'm going through six years of slack Trying not to Trying not to waste time by making and you can't search so whenever I'm literally scrolling through So I'm scrolling through And I'm about to give up and then yesterday. So I'm going through I did over three different days so like two hours at a time and yesterday I I'm going through and I'm listening to these various things that are in there. There's tons of that I've put into slack and I find this one guitar part. I was like, oh, yeah, I remember that. I never did anything with that. I'm listening to it. And out of nowhere, this is what's so interesting about this stuff. Out of nowhere, I start mumble singing over it. Never did it before. And then I just, for no reason, sing Ophelia. And like this sort of like, it's almost, it's basically the chorus and I go, oh, that, I'm going to record that really quick. Right? then I do the thing. I play the guitar part and then I mumble singing over it and I record it onto another device and then I'm like, oh, that's pretty good. I think I did that yesterday. then I went back and I listened to it or I did that two days ago and then I went back and I think I came up with it and I just remembered it. And I like, I really got to record that. So then I recorded it. Yesterday and I was listening to it. It's like oh, that's kind of interesting and I'm like What the hell is Ophelia right like Ophelia's from something right so I go to the church and I'm like I'm like who's Ophelia? Thanks. yeah, she's like from Hamlet. I got all here. Right and I asked you I go what if I wanted to oh no it said Ophelia was this character In her the Ark of her story was told through songs her songs and Hamlet and I'm like, I don't really remember that I go what are Ophelia's songs and it lists these four songs and like chunks of the Text and I go that's interesting and in my mind Right, but in my mind I was singing To her not about her So because the first lines I was mumble singing was like I was singing to her So I'm reading the synopsis and I was like oh, this is really interesting. Oh It's like, hey, what if I wanted to write a song about Ophelia where I'm singing to her about, you know, her arc or her stories, and it goes, oh, well, you could do it like this, and I you not. What it spit out, I was like, oh my god, that's a great idea. And then I started pulling its words, and I literally wrote pretty much the whole song in like 10 minutes. And I was like, finally chanting, but again, right, it's the person prompting it. It's like, it's not just, it's not going to just write a song. If you ask it to write a song about Ophelia, it would suck. time I've asked it to help with lyrics before, it's been horrible.
00:34:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also the fact that there's a huge database around. So it didn't just get to tap into that story. It got to tap into Shakespeare, like a much bigger library. So, like, if you had asked about Sarah, like, what is there a depth about Sarah, there may be something, but my point is, is that the sort of course of the information was deep.
00:35:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of people writing about that. Right. Good point.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but even more than that, Shakespeare stuff himself.
00:35:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
00:35:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, he wrote over 100 plays. Yeah, and his all his information has been broken down. Yeah, that's that. So I had today based off of something I saw from someone. And I was like, Oh, a reference point that that that uses a lot of because like I use a lot of analogies and people like, wow, you should write that down. I've never heard that before. then like, Deepak Chopra and a couple other people. The right so minor different. I don't talk about the universe to talk about God. But every now and then, like, I use these analogies. And I'm like, if I could find a way to blend what it already knows about that. with my own philosophies plus because there's there's way more of his words written than I have written to train with. But actually what I really want to do is go get somebody to go through like all of my fathom recordings and find just my stuff, copy and paste my stuff like not client stuff, but because because fathom will say this is Tina. And then use that because then that's a huge library that that I don't have created. So that would be awesome. But yeah, that's amazing. Hold on second. She may be to go. And my daughter's texting. Who is that? She's got to go like over a mountain. That's what we call it over the mountain to this place called Metford and pick up a car door from a junkyard because she's going to replace her own car door.
00:36:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's my kid.
00:36:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's also going to beauty school. She does tattoo. She does like wild makeup and my kids. I think they're awesome You try me, but they're awesome Okay, um, all of the stuff is gonna be so cool. Oh How did we even get to the music stuff from Mushi FBT Oh, yeah, so just the pace of this evolution like here's what I think is going to happen is these Small solopreneur type people which you're not that anymore, but but the people like you and I that have super creative brains and Have a difficult time sometimes it's financially But sometimes it's just because you can't get somebody to get your vision which has been your biggest issue from the beginning We can train because you can train AI faster, right when it's good But but we're learning how fast it's going to get good like it's going to pull away, like your ability to get the bigger. Did I lose you? Hello. Oh, you're muted. You're not muted anymore. Can you hear me? I don't hear you, but I do hear like something.
00:38:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't don't hear you. What is happening? Uh, yeah, missed all that. Sorry.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, what happened?
00:38:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Let me see. Couldn't get my vision.
00:38:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. So, but the way that AI is evolving, your ability to be able to train it and train it quickly and be able to get some of the things done that you couldn't, just because you go. to it and it will give the instructions to the lay people, right, the other people that you need it to. But what I'm thinking is that this is going to be, so we've watched these different stages of technology and how it's helped small people, small businesses pull hard and fast up through, you know, to compete with bigger, like your goal of getting market share, increased market share, those types of things for somebody that thinks so differently, like you do, like I do. I think that there's, this is going to be like a catapult for people that are using it and I think that that's going to be fascinating because I think that this, I don't think it's the disruptor people think it's going to be en masse, like on a big scale, because most people last week was.
00:39:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah? Yeah, so that a big part of that was tied to the reporting on and how the AI companies are not profitable, none of them are profitable, and they're not gonna be. So reality, right? we're so steep, and we're not even steeped in it, but we are, like, compared to the lay person. We're like, it's like, we're in the deep end. But yeah, all these, they're not making any money. No one's paying for it. I am. You are, but we're, we're unique. Right. You know, who's, you know, who's not paying for it? My neighbor on that side, my neighbor on that side, my neighbor over there, my neighbor over there, none of them. No one I work with is paying for it, right? No one I work with directly here is paying for it. Not one person. They asked me to pay for it.
00:40:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, and we're sharing an account. Hey, that's $20.
00:40:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh.
00:40:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. All my clients have it, but I have almost no clients now because I fired people and yeah, that's a whole nother conversation actually. Um, yeah. So actually, I was thinking about asking a question, but the question is just on, could I tell you things that you never repeat to anybody? They're not inappropriate or anything like that. Or like, pretty much, I don't ever talk to anybody about what we talk about. Well, one of them is related to somebody I never ever speak about.
00:41:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. I don't really matter who it is.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, I'm like, I'm like a bald tina, like a bald. Except in case we like you just get, you just get annoyed and like you say things and I still think that you're a bald. just like, I would need you to be a mindful vault about that. Because the only reason I would hold on. Uh, uh, you, it's been a long time since he's posted, but have you seen any of the posts related to any government entities?
00:42:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, we're talking about Facebook.
00:42:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. No.
00:42:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, he's made a couple of, um, references to it. Uh, SCC, FTC.
00:42:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:42:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but, uh, I, I've literally barely done those. So, well, it's been a long time since he said it. And most people, I don't think pay attention to it.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Unless they've had to deal with those entities before.
00:42:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. But he's been talking about it for years. You know what they can do to people when they're investigating, right? Uh, Yes. So that situation has been going on for like a decade. And, um, geez. But indeed, I get emotional. Sorry. It's really annoying.
00:43:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, please. Okay. That works.
00:43:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have locked everything up that long.
00:43:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which way?
00:43:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Huh?
00:43:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
For who?
00:43:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My guy.
00:43:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
For Dexter?
00:43:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:43:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he's a good person about this?
00:43:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He hasn't for a long time, but he has.
00:43:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never seen, I've never seen his stuff. But I've never seen him talk about this. Oh, I've never seen him to harass Dan.
00:43:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, they are thieves. what those entities do is criminal.
00:43:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:43:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are, you lose. Yes, okay, the only reason he stopped fighting them was because of me and he knew that it would just Like you can't you can't win.
00:44:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You're right.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You lose But but because of me he's trying to play their game and just not die Right Not because the money. I don't I don't care if he has any of it And he's willing to lose it all this had cannot go anywhere else.
00:44:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've not told his business to anybody Yeah No, no one I know knows who he is.
00:44:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah Yeah, the only vision that we're not married is because of this because and they can get into my stuff Yep, totally. So we've not been able to have the lives that we've wanted to because of this and yeah and it's it's it's the government like drag it out okay but on top of that um we have relatives who have dealt with cancer and being homeless and I've been financing everything um I really hate emotions I would just I'm fine sometimes it just like comes out and physically like it pisses me off because I'm like I I'm fine it doesn't feel like this but anyway um I have just been getting I don't want this on text or email so I had to do it on a call I've talked to Mark about it too because I'm not I can't keep up and I have to do something but I don't have an engine like I don't mark it I've always had enough for me. I have plenty for me, but I have been taking care of three other families for years.
00:46:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:46:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm I can't anymore. I mean, I'm going to I can't but I can't afford it. I've got to generate more money. And so I've been working on the course. But the problem is I have to hire people and I can't afford to hire people. I don't need a lot. Just to extract it from me. The whole course issue that we've discovered, that's the biggest thing.
00:46:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Somebody needs an extraction.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I have that. I have, I'm going to text you my little whiteboard thing. You can see this. You have an extractor come in. do.
00:46:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do.
00:46:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She comes into my house. She also cleaned. I have to be able to afford her. And she lost her job. So I really have. have to be able to afford her because she needs it. And it's just another family that like, I'm going to take care of everybody until I can't. And I will do all that because I can make money. I can make all the money. That's the thing. have no scarcity mindset whatsoever. That's why I'm willing to volunteer 12 hours. It's in your text. I have so much energy.
00:47:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've done so much healing.
00:47:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mood is good. Like if you pick on it and like zoom in.
00:47:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I am. I love you.
00:47:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the orange things are concepts. green ones or they switch colors because those sticky notes are action items. So everything is a concept with a tactical practice. And then of course I teach it's a constant iteration. So these are the fundamentals. These are everything that we do. all the time, but I teach people that it's, you know, everything builds upon itself. So anyway, there are two things that I need. First of all, Mark sending me Fuji, the doctor, and he paid, I told him, so this wasn't my new pricing structure, and it's not for IM people because they can't do it, but doctors, doctors, lawyers, expensive professionals who have spent a lot of money on education who immediately understand the benefit of it. I said it was $5,000 a month with, you pay by the quarter with at least a 90-day commitment because I've got to have at least 90 days for you to know if there's anything.
00:48:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, we figured that out, yeah.
00:48:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. then, or $4,000 a month, but you pay six months at a time, and so he did that. So, was $4,000 a month for him, and he's immediately happy. His wife is so excited. His wife comes to talk to me on the— videos. It's amazing. I'm so happy with it. But anyway, what I'm trying to figure out, and I gave Mark a pitch, I've got to stop worrying about money. don't, it's sucking the energy out of me. I need to be able to just have the team. And you know how everybody else is like, oh, go to have this person full time. Well, I don't need full time. I need like 10 hours from my developer. I need 20 or 30 hours from Stephanie, which is my, she cleans for me, but also she does this. She has run businesses. She's a business. ran a retirement center. she flipped that thing around, man. She is a workhorse. So she, she understands things professionally, but she also is like my best friend. She claims she's like one of those amazing rare people that can do a few different types of things. And she is and I'm learning from her too that I could teach my stuff to people that manage who maybe they're corporate managers or whatever like there's so many different entry points like I would market it as though it's a completely different product but it'd be the same thing just with a different entry point so like same product but I like Fletcher yeah his theory is that you bring them in on any of the nine column headers here but actually they could all come in on the same thing it would just be the story is different as to why they need it yeah they're saying I need time management or I need how to build the team but in reality we know actually you need yes you do need that that's just the pain that's right the face that you have right yeah punch in the face you have right now but we all know you don't know your numbers so the pitch that I gave to Mark out of I can only call it does it what it's It's not just desperation. was, it was inspired by that, but I'm trying to figure out what is the thing that makes sense for somebody else. Like, I don't want charity. I don't want somebody just give money, but this is going to take a little while to build out. But I'm like, I can't even tell you, you know when you know that you've got all the things, I've got all the things. Every single time I teach anybody anything, anytime I have a conversation, at some point, somebody goes, holy , I've never thought of that before. And then there's something that they can go wrong with because the people I'm talking to have brains at their homes and they do really cool and exciting things. Anyway, and I know that I can market this. The reason I started, you know, showing up on video is just to get over any shyness being on video.
00:51:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I was like, jump on Zoom sometimes with video. Just there was a reason.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just conditioning myself. And, and And the point that nobody says anything. So I'm like, that's that's the whole thing. I need to tell myself, nobody cares. Nobody cares. So anyway, the pitch that I gave Mark was that I'm like, you're gonna be like, yeah, you got some brass balls. Anyway, I want to get $100,000 and not think about anything and hire everybody, build my marketing campaign, go nuts on it. I don't even care if I I've got people who cannot, they're going to be homeless. They would be wasn't for me every single month. Anyway, but but the deal is that I would give 10% of any money coming in and up to $200,000 or for the next 10 years, but it's going to be faster than that. So that they double their income period. In addition to that, I would give any time they want anywhere, but I want to be able to know that I don't have to go chase money. I'm gonna and a building engine. But the other thing is like, so Dexter and I have had a rule. I don't have male partners. I'm like, you don't get to dictate that anymore. I have to do what I have to do. You can be afraid. You can be afraid and break up with me if you want to. He would never. But it really makes him afraid. And this is terrible against his ego. If he knew I did this, he might. I think it would crush him. Which is why he can't know because he can't handle it. But the up you see will kill you.
00:53:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I don't have any other options not to take care of my family.
00:53:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But this is not coming from a place of weakness. I'm on fire damn. Like I just I have so much energy for working and building this out and this AI stuff with the Dev girl that I got, which you have your own team. But with Stephanie's help, Maria just It was something kind of to rip off of. She, that girl takes too much stuff on her.
00:54:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But, but there are. Yeah, she, uh, she's ping pong's around.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She does. And I don't want to ping pong, which is why I want to be able to hire people direct them very specifically, no favors. Like I, the other thing is the girls, like I'm down to one, basically. The other one is going to start school. She may be staying here, but also I need to pay for her school. And, um, I just, I don't want, when you worry about money, it's Maslov's hierarchy, but it's also his paradigm. You can't think about higher level things when you're in pain. So I need to get rid of the pain so I can be high performance, but I feel high performance all over the place. I just am not working with anybody and I don't have the financial resources. And I need to figure out how to get to that. And if I can figure out a way to, but I, I can't tell anybody. That's the other thing.
00:55:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can't help it.
00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
two. So I told Mark, I'm like, can I give you a dollar? And then anything I tell you, you can't say because it's privileged. He said, yeah. Yeah. That's true. then mowed him. This was like two months ago. And that's when he got Fuji and he's like, I'm texting two people. It was like 11.30 at night on a Saturday because that's losing my mind per minute. So now you're in the loop. But I don't know if there's anything that you'd be interested in that we could do. I will partnership. I don't care. I will work like crazy. You could have ownership. This would be, I'm not even being clear about anything right now, really specific. I could build that. But it's mostly a download of information and your brain does things. So that's where I'm starting. And you have your own puzzle. I don't know if there'd be something you'd be willing to invest in with an income guarantee contract like you'll get your money back however long it takes kind of thing and obviously there's risk involved but I don't think it's much of a risk because I'm pretty sure you know I can do these things so that's something to think about and just whatever part of it would just be benevolence like a huge part of it that would be the initial thing I know that but the other part of it would be I'd make sure you get your money back I have no I made a million dollars in coaching 10 hours a week or less in six years but it's not enough not while I'm taking care of other families and I fired the pain and he asked people that were draining me So that's the other thing.
00:57:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not making nearly what I used to make. Right. I have that as well.
00:57:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, and I can't bring on just anybody. And I really want my time needs to be leveraged like everybody else's. I've got to build the course, but it's happening.
00:57:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm doing it. all you need to do. That's literally like if you don't, you shouldn't even be building a website. You shouldn't. There's no reason to have a website if you don't have a course.
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not building it.
00:57:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm making sure I have something to do it. It's always the time. Right. They're all, it's all sort of, you know, which isn't exactly accurate, but it's all like proactive. It's like, oh, I'll just go work of the website. Well, you know that the teeth pulling or whatever you want to, however we want to not authorize it. It's doing that bit now. You got a lot done though. So props, but it really comes down to that like if there's It's like you're building a house for something that doesn't exist. And it's like, you know what? Build the shelter for it after it exists But nobody makes the damn course like I just went through this with DK DK is gone. you not two Years he's been working on it And I said it's not with it. I'm like, dude, and he's getting hung up on like the names of the steps It starts really cool gives a So there's a 82 pages like this has to be this is not enough I have to fix it and then I know but I mean I can see it. I know you right. I'm looking I get I read the nine things I go yeah, there's really good like I don't I My feedback would be like, yeah, okay This seems like a good framework, but like then here are the bones right here's the skeletons Now you got to go throw the meat on it and then it's like, it's got to be, you know, so that when you do sell it, because the ease, you know, the quote unquote, easy part, right? easy part is building the funnel or whatever, right? It's like that's the easy part. Yes. The hard part is all the work that you put in over the years to get the know how and whatever, right? mean, that's ultimately what they're buying. Um, do you go, I'm just going through it. Yeah. And I mean, just go hard at this. Go hard at this and just get it done, whether it's video, I don't know what, however you want to deliver it, like, but like build the thing and then go build the parts around it, right? And then, then you get into the funnel metrics and then split everything in the blah, blah, blah. But it, and it might be, if you have this and then a website, then you can do a damn thing again, right? Go go to Meredith and like do that pitch. Like look back at things that worked, except this time you're like, I'm not, I'm not putting them in a one-on-one opportunity tonight. You go make a similar pitch, but it's gonna be for this. Yeah, and maybe some people do, as you know, they will, right? people are gonna go the Fuji path, but it's like I was on the horn with a hannock the other day. So like he had to fire the number one, the number one salesperson, and then that turned into a total show where she came, she came back and started poisoning the well and all this stuff. So he went on vacation, air quotes, and while on vacation, he worked four of the seven days, and he just keeps coming back to, I'm like, dude, are you just not seeing the part where like you hate the business model that you have? are you, when are you gonna get that message? You you built the wrong business and now you're you're like you got at this life preserver Oh, and then his his ops guy Went totally sideways. So the integrator dude all of a sudden start talking about how he doesn't understand Some of the metrics and I'm like he's just bringing this up now What are you talking about? But it's like he should he should have he's like I should ever recurring revenue business. I go yeah You should right so like you're saying yours is gonna be hybrid and it's like So you could end up with like I think wedmore. I do not like him by the way There's he just rose me the wrong way.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's something off about him.
01:01:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I don't either but there no I know but I think his Yeah, his presentation is good and I don't think his content's great. Your versus better You have more probable probable probably have more actual legitimate success that he does, right? mean, he's slinging courses to people that are never gonna finish them.
01:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which you'll get that too, but that's not your intent. That is his intent. His intent is full well-knowing, like, and that he's gonna upsell.
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I will get what I know I will get is whatever time they're willing to spend with me, they're gonna think a new thought and they're gonna change something. I guarantee you know what he's gonna go through any module and not think that even just slightly differently and operate just slightly differently. that's iterative change. And that's all I'm promising. And if you want more, you just keep coming back.
01:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So. And then once you have this feedback loop, it'll get better.
01:02:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
100%. That's the thing about being on the mission and everything else. Now that the girls are grown, I don't have kids to take care of anymore. I do. I have these, but I, the capacity that I have for wanting to teach and lead, but also I'm constantly learning. So very few of the teachers are constant and intentional students. I always am a student. Like I'm always, you know, how humble can you be if you say that you're humble? But like I'm very aware that I don't know what I don't know.
01:03:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm always learning.
01:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's the thing too. 100%. I know it's unique. So I can create this stuff, but here's where I get caught up and you know this is I overthink things. You don't be the only one that I know who doesn't sugarcoat things, who has the experience, who knows the benefits. So what I need to do is keep this minimal, sufficient enough that somebody can comprehend it. like MVP, right? Smallest actionable stuff. Can I get you to and I can pay for it? I don't care how it happens But as I create a chapter get your feedback on it and say I think you're missing this I think you're this is too much I think whatever because I will overthink it if I don't have some sort of feedback loop.
01:04:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to have it Yeah, totally. Okay, that would be really helpful to me I think that should be the short-term thing like Right like forget about the other Energy the thing that I need you to understand about other people. It's not just proactive avoidance. It's it's I know I said it wasn't the exact right word.
01:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes. No, right. So I don't spend any time on it I talked to her an hour a week and it literally is mostly it's just like a battery pack for me So it gives me a little boost of energy it 100% is a placebo effect But it still has an impact of like, okay, it feels like there's something happening, but where my real time does go is this, is actually writing this stuff.
01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's the difference that separates me from other people is I'm aware.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, you've done a lot too. That's pacifier. I better be looking at it go, I'm sucking my thumb. Okay, let's go right. Anyway, but um, so if you do think about it, and if you can think of anything where there would be terms and maybe you talked around that, don't know of something where I would I'm not going to stop working. That's the whole point of this where you can get your money back. It's not a charity investment, but maybe it's a just it is a an investment that takes a little while to get back. If you'll think about it, if you're like Tina, that's just not, no, that's fine, whatever, I'm at the point where I can't be proud.
01:06:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I've been there.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't enjoy that, by the way.
01:06:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I've been there. Well, I've also been on the other side where I've been too proud, both both are not great.
01:06:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Despite the fact that I like get emotional cry, I don't feel weak. I don't feel trapped. don't feel helpless, but I do feel like the biggest thing that I need to do is trust who I can trust, ask what I can ask and get by us to work and stay at work. So, I'm doing all the things, I'm not letting pride get in my way, I'm not being lazy. If I suck my thumb for an hour, we're talking to a developer, which it's just more about there's somebody that I'm training her how I think when the time... I mean, I get it.
01:06:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I get it. Yeah. Right. So, that was also before you showed me 82 pages, so I'm like, all right, you're doing the thing. Right. Because it's all about the thing, right? It's all about the product, right? You can... You have to have the product. I think you do have the product. Within you, right? It's like so and now you're making the product and then it's like okay now go market product Now I'll get the product out there, but where people People get hung up on never building you did too, but now all of a sudden right Or not the best reasons you're like . I gotta I gotta jam my nose against this grindstone. Here we go And you're doing the thing. So it's like, okay, great. And then I'm more than happy to help you Review it or whatever And then I'm I certainly will consider it, but I'm obviously going to be like All right, is this progressing?
01:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what's going on? But that would be perfect because I Responded really well to that Right I don't and I don't give excuses I'll like stay up all night and be like, okay, here's something here says like whatever I don't have a Tina in my life. I don't have anybody that does that and I do needed. So that's part of what's so funny.
01:08:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's the comedy is that literally two months ago maybe three I told my sister you should call up Tina and you guys should For lack of a better word harass each other to getting your courses done like that was that would be the best thing you guys could do for each other and she didn't do it because in the reason she didn't do it is because She doesn't really want I think she does want to start a business But I don't think she really thinks she can do it and I'm not gonna say that to her But that's exactly what I believe and now all of a sudden she finds herself That was up The years up like she wasted a year like you should have spent I tried to tell her she should have spent a year Doing once she just got a coaching client for 25 grand. I'm like there are more but you're I, of course, you and I, you know, universe, religion, we want to call her. I'm like, she's closing herself off from it at like a subconscious level. See, it's telling herself it's not really real yet.
01:09:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
here you go, you just made 25 grand.
01:09:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. How many more of those do you need? And I was trying to get her with something like, you've done it, but she's never done it. like, what's the math? What is the math we're working with you? I can't help you if I don't understand the math. And like, she can't tell me, hey, I need to make this much a month of money. then I'd be like, okay, great. What I want to know from her is, how much money do you need to make a month? And how much money does Robin need?
01:09:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is your not? There's two elements that go into that.
01:09:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You got to live and you got a fund, let's call it. What is that number? Yeah. you can work backwards. You have the number and now you're trying to work backwards.
01:09:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how you have to do it.
01:09:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So you can tell her, oh, I need to. make a million to our month, it's like, good luck.
01:10:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can tell her, because I think that she thinks whatever that I'm, I won't say better, but at something that she's not at, and it has my experience doing it myself has no bearing on it because she just, she just did it in a different world. So the valuation is what's different, that's all, skill and ability is not what's different. And her knowing that she can exist in this world is what's different because I know I can because I have. And I know that I do it really better than anybody else I know because for what I do make and how little I work and how little I worked for it, because it's all been word of mouth. I don't know anybody else who has done it to that level. So I have confidence from that.
01:10:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And dumbfounded by the amount of money you made up on, it's like dumbfounded. Yeah.
01:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I missed that.
01:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did she really make it all by?
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
heard about it.
01:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally. She doesn't have a court. She should. She should have a court that she doesn't. But a big part of that was parenting and motherhood. I was just gonna say you didn't need to do it before. Right. At some point, it's like, Oh, needs to happen. And then the need or at right, it's pacing all the things to you.
01:11:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly. All and it's all the things that I teach. So if you want to tell her, because that, like I said, I draw energy from the the riffing kind of thing. But it's very difficult to find a running mate from my brain. Lisa. I mean, she she and also she does like you that she's like, like the very first conversation we had. She's like, wait a minute. And like, like, yeah. she's very frank, which is amazing and awesome. And yeah, so if you could, I would give her we could give each other an hour a week and it would just be give feedback, give suggestions, whatever.
01:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I of bill a buddies.
01:12:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.

I still think she should do it. She did two interviews. talked to me and it was like, one, was like, if they offer you the job, you got to take it. And neither one of them hired her. And I was like, you are now your client. Like in my head, I was like, you are your client. Like, so what would you tell your client, right? What would they do? So she's interviewing for another place, but I'm like, maybe they're not going to hire you. But you know, she did the coaching thing or whatever. She never watched like her stuff. And again, I don't think it's the greatest, but I do think they're I still think like you can use it to come up with to sort of structure something.
01:12:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think honestly, if she looked at my carbs and what I think that she would go wait, these are the things that I do. So like, I just have to sit there, and that, by the way, that has come out over the last year and a half, maybe, of going, okay, what are the things? Well, and it did start with Fletcher stuff, but in terms of, like, I saw a road map, and then I was like, I hate all of this, let me do my own thing, but all I needed was to see a road map and to know, oh, I need a road map.
01:13:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, and that's the thing about so does your client. Yeah. Yeah. think that he's so right about that. Like, people want to see a solution.
01:13:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, oh, I can, can absorb that.
01:13:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That makes sense.
01:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. They want to know that there's not just a point A and a point D, but they want to see that there are steps in between, which was something I did innately, but I didn't map it out. So what I would say is, hey, tell me where you want to go and let's work backwards. It was the same concept in my mind, but I never showed that. to anybody and seeing it, I was like, holy , they need to see it.
01:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, your B, your proverbial B is, hey, I'm not working this much. I'm not working this hard. I'm making more money. All the, all the things I don't like are gone and the things that I do like are still here. And you're like, yeah, your A is where you are right now. I can get you to B, and you know how you do that? It's these steps. And they go, oh, and it's true, right? If you, you know that those nine steps, and they don't necessarily go in order, right? Because they could come in on whatever, but that pathway or the learning those nine things, whatever the hell it's, you know, displayed to them will get them to be. Like, your people are all looking for the same B. I want, like, Mark. Mark's a good example. I'm sure Fuji's a good example. So, yeah, totally. And Mark's, I love how Mark on the phone the other day is like, what are we doing? I was like, I'm not, Sure, what we're doing, but we're going to do this math here, buddy. Can do that.
01:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, yeah, and we had an extra column. going to that's the one that I accidentally sent the notes. The whoopsie, which all got smoothed out because really the AI.
01:15:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, how, how is that what your summary is? That was not. Oh, sometimes they're horrible.
01:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So anyway, but all right. Well, we, I just totally used up your time.
01:15:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So sorry about that.
01:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
actually knowing you that if it came out that Lisa finally got something and she gets talked into getting help from somebody that can, you know, actually run with her extract things from her. Um, I, I adored her. I think she's amazing. She is incredible. And this process would be, I think the biggest issue for her would be figuring out the market.
01:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Think about your day. If you think of one, write it down. then when you get home, take that post and know that you thought of and put it wherever the hell it belongs.
01:17:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm sure you can start with nine.
01:17:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It just ends up being late.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So no, I had like four or five. That was the original. And then I realized that there's, um, there's the next level stuff. So like the sharpen your saw and like mind your heart, those two last ones. They are like, how do you feed the visionary? How do you keep that person, um, up with everything, sharpening your shawl, whatever you're the best at, you have to keep doing it. You do it normally and naturally, but basically it's the shield against apathy and complacency. And then the mind's your heart or yeah, mind's your heart. So that's about heart and mind. It's that we're human beings. Um, and if you don't constantly feed yourself with positive information that strengthens you, that encourages you. urges you that uplifts you when it's a fan because it will, when you lose a spouse, when you lose a child, when you lose some function in your body, when you lose a parent, whatever, whatever happens when we go through a recession, something's going to happen to you. If you haven't intentionally been fortifying yourself on a daily basis, on a steady basis, when that comes, it's going to crush you. So that's something that is a part of my process, right? We do it in our coaching sessions and things like that. But it's not, you know, technically the business stuff, but it 100% is a strategy. It's an intentional strategy. It's a regular part of my practice. And so it got added into it. And yeah, anyway, so that's how it came about. So with Visa, I would just say, what are the things you always teach people? And I would show her how to use chat TBT and a Google Doc, and just go like, what are the things like, tell me some of the stories? Well, in those stories, we're going to extract a concept and she could start by telling chat GPT stories and then go okay what is the premise what is the concept that I taught and I could teach her how to do those things and then now she's got something that she can be working with if it's three o'clock in the morning and she can't sleep and she's like these things are on her mind but you don't want to go call somebody because everybody else is sleeping because they're saying they're not really um you know what I mean so that could be I could teach her those things because that's what I've been doing with this is using chat GPT telling it stories and then having it give me some like extraction like what did you notice I'm like oh yeah that's what I do and then I go write something what yeah yeah so anyway okay so sorry that was just there no even clear ending point I've got lots of questions for you and I've already taken a letter of time so I'll wait till next week but also thank you for being
01:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
the exceptional Dan that you are because um well I can pay you a dollar to put you under oath like where you can't see me but I can trust that so anyway you for being that awesome I appreciate you before I go though is there anything that's like I don't know something crazy that happened this week or something problematic so I can we can either talk about it or putting notes down so I can ask about it next week no I am just waiting for the supervised guys though they came back with like they can do the code when they came back they quoted doing the authorized dot man so they're up to like 20 grams it's like 20 grams to do all the customizations whatever and now and they're like do you want to make an offer for the copy the software do you want us to I'm like you can which they wouldn't do before so I'm like okay another willing to do it. And so I'm waiting for them to come back with that. So it'll be like 20 grand plus that. And then weirdly, the universe, I got Noria working on his or the employee or whatever, or high level. So I'm him and I'm sort of teaching him that like he asked questions like, Oh no, do do this. Look at this. This is how this works. And then in I look, I found something yesterday by accident is high level just randomly releases . Like there's no way you can keep up with it. And they're releasing something next week called third party integrations that I read today. And I was like, this is exactly what we need, I think. But I never thought about it. I had, I just thought they're never gonna do that. They're doing it. So I had this function that I wanted to put into follower flow. And Like, oh my god, we're going to be able to do that in a week. So I said it tomorrow, I go, hey, look at this. And I think this is where we need to go. I'm pretty sure he's going to come back and say yes. So yeah, that's like, wait. I'm waiting on you. I want to see what those guys come back with.
01:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's awesome. Oh, I'm Marsha stuff. Just quick update.
01:22:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm now delving into the custom JavaScript. So I haven't heard back from Melissa. I'm to hit up Melissa. She's going to it. I want to see where she's at. I've decided that I'm just going to rather than take a Tilla's container, I'm going to build a brand new one because Marsha, I didn't realize that they had all these pre-made templates for GTM, and he uses a bunch of them that we would use, like, Clarify or Clarity. He's like, oh, we use the Clarity template. We use this template, and then they have a template. So I think I'm. better off just and and the one that Attila built for ninja is custom. It has like a domain look up table. So we have like a master container that works for four sites. And it's cool. But I'm like, yeah, I don't think we'd ever do that again. So I need to build like one that's single domains ready. So yeah, I'm like, I'm gonna go I'm gonna finish this thing and then build my first container, which actually uses his starting container. then I append that with some other stuff. And then I'll push it onto woofer. Oh, and those guys met with Frank yesterday. I'm going out to lunch with Derek to get the Frank update. I decided when Eric was like, oh, we're just talking about getting stuff, the meetings at 6 a.m. You can be there or not. was like, or not, sounds good. I'll be in the or not column. That's funny.
01:23:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So wait, Frank was meeting with woofer?
01:23:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, no, with Abhishek,
01:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you switched here so fast. I did. Why had you?
01:24:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, that was the third thing.
01:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, that's the only other thing to, that I'm working on the things that are lurking earlier.
01:24:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
01:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when do, when does Frank think Wolf be done? Wait, Wolf was already.
01:24:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know. Yeah. So they updated him on that. So he was back on his vacation and then they did all the get stuff and then recovering that with him and then I decided not to go up, show up to the meeting and sleep for another hour. So I'm going to take Eric out to lunch and just text it on, have you eaten and I'll get the update from Eric today.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. Okay. So here's what I'll say. If you, I don't have to have the number that I said, that was the one that will give me like six months. Don't worry about it. So, because I've got Mark and I've got Guji, and I've got you, and I've got one other client, and that's it right now. There's a couple of me, but I really don't want them, and I really want to be able to stay focused on this. So if there's anything that you end up thinking of, okay, I'd be willing to invest this for that kind of thing, and it'd be a long-term turnaround, pretty much everything helps me not stress out about it right now. And then the whole Lisa thing would just be, it's just whatever, whether I get something out of it or not, I told her, would just do it for her if I got nothing out of it, because I want to see her do it.
01:25:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is she doesn't, not that she doesn't want to do it, it's that she doesn't think it's possible, I guess. I haven't talked or I'll hit her up. She's supposed to call me an item, call her back, oops.
01:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll text her, be like, well, yeah, I'll probably talk to her So the other thing is, ask her what she's What is the it? So when people are not specific, that's that's what makes it harder to believe it's possible. What does it look like? And exercise in the nevetsal. So for me, it was x amount of money, x amount of time. I'm happy not working with . That was it. That was it. So now that I knew what it wasn't, I'm not working with . I'm not working more than 20 hours a week. I'm not making less than x. Those put the parameters in place. So then it's like, what do I have to offer? Who will say yes to it? What's the math, right? How many people? And like, so what's the math of the number? How many people? What's the minimum amount of people I can have to get to that number? If I offer x, can I deliver x at a no-brainer price? Well, they'll be happy that they for sure see enough value in it that they'll pay that price. it's really simple math, but you have to answer some questions first and specifics, and I always start with, what do you not want? I don't want to make less than X. I don't want to work more than X. I don't want to work more than this time, and I don't want to deal with these kind of people. That creates the first container. That creates the first part of the mass. anyway, if you have enough of that conversation with her that she thinks that there's some positive, because the thing that I don't do is wrestle with people. You don't either. It's your sister, so it's different. You should wrestle with her a little bit and help her have some confidence in it, because we get to a point where jobs just don't make any sense. Age-wise, life-wise, it's just not worth it. But I don't know if you know anybody else who can figure out how to get everything I want within those parameters, and I did it. The only exception was the pandemic. Being with somebody who's dealing with this with the FTC and wanting to take care of three additional families. is at all costs, which is not normal.
01:28:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Most people don't have those things going on. Yeah, the only other person that knows me. Right. And how many people did you know? It was, I don't want to work for anyone else, initially. And then it became, oh, I need to make five grand a month. And then it became, oh, I want to do this. But it was always about, I don't want to work for anybody. So yeah, I don't know what her is. I don't think she knows. So it's a very good point. So it's like her it slash you're not like somewhere. If you define these two things, then you can and she, you know, sort of the perfect day concept, which is, I think the problem is just that her paradigm, she has this, she has this NPC, right? Sort of a paradigm of like, oh, you go, you get a job, you have a career. it's like, yes. Yeah. That is up.
01:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the institutional thinking. Yep. And that's what I told I her when I talked to her is that and that's why school is so difficult because your program to be an institutional person to go get a job in an institution where you continue to be programmed as an institutional person, which is you are there to serve, not to be served.
01:29:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:29:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so if she was be willing to talk to me one week, once a week or a month, just come spend time with me, I will extract things out of her. I guarantee you that she will have a paradigm shift unless she refuses to do it.
01:29:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, which is the current methodology.
01:29:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Yeah. But if after that much, she still refuses to do it, then you know what you know, and that is that until the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change, wait, pain of change is yeah, that's what I
01:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
in it.
01:30:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then she won't change, but at least we'll have resources when she is ready. Okay. Anyway, okay, I'll be quiet.
01:30:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thank you. Have a good day.
