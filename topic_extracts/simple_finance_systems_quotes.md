Oh, that's not good sound. Hello. Can you hear me?
00:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I heard that.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was really garbled.
00:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Don't give me that crap.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what it is, Dan. I can't help it. Are you there?
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
About now. I think it's because I was on Wi-Fi and data.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can hear you. It's still a way. Not great sound quality, but anyway. I had to do this real quick. How, what happens, I mean, unless it's personal and stuffs Monday, that you couldn't come to our meeting?
00:01:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I hired this dog trainer that Glenn recommended, because it's like completely transformed Glenn's dog, blah, blah, blah, long story short, the guy basically kidnapped the dog. So, I had to go to Phoenix to get the dog back, because his life fell apart. He had no car, he was homeless, he had no car, he's got some crazy girlfriend, she kicked him out. The girlfriend started sending me all these weird messages, and I'm like, is going on? He was supposed to bring back the dog on Tuesday, and he's like, I can't do it. like, oh, got to be kidding me. Nice. So, I had to fly to Phoenix and drive back to get Zinnia, and she's now trying. Right.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As far as I can tell, I just that's terrible.
00:02:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so you and Glenn are talking again, friends or like, no, he, well, I mean, I do talk to him here and there, but you not me, Tina, I don't do emotional . So he had recommended the guy back in the fall and I talked to the dude briefly and then I just sort of blew it off. But then I was like, right, we get this other dog, like she really needs to like, I just need her to like, get a catch up. Right. So I'm like, can't train two dogs at once, but I'm gonna have to know. And the dude has like great reviews. I guess Glenn never told me this. Glenn told me this recently. the reason when I had like two trainers and neither one of them could really train Malu, which is his German Shepherd. And then Malu was like really fear aggressive. And he was also just sort of not, he was like, unwieldy. And then Malu bit Glenn's mother, she had to go to the hospital get an operation, like, and then that really freaked Glenn out. He's like, wouldn't they wouldn't let anyone come to their house. The dog got worse. So then he found this dude. And now the dog is like, it's a different dog. It's like the dog's like, everyone comes over, we go on walks, no, no more fear aggression. You got to go to the other. And I was like, Oh, yeah, there you go. And then Glenn sound like, other people to the guy. They all raving reviews. They're like, Oh, this guy's great. And then his online reviews are like five stars. So it's like, All right, don't mistake it.
00:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, that's wild.
00:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
wild. It was unfolding. I'm like, what?
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now I'm wondering, did your psychic tell you any of this was going to happen? Like not specifically, right?
00:04:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it was this wild. I don't know.
00:04:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What a story.
00:04:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how much, how has been getting her and.
00:04:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it was like four grand to, like, I, when it's all said no, I'm like, but I, he had videos of her and she'd be doing all the things. So I'm like, all right, she is sort of and then he's like, the dude is very apologetic. I mean, I think he just didn't see it, but I'm like, best intentions, bro. it's like they don't mean a whole lot so I'm supposed that he's supposed to like do video call on Friday I'm like this is all for Denise this is not for me it's for her but but yeah so I saw videos of her like healing like a pro right next to him to do that with me so there's still a chance I did some stuff I was doing but the whole rigmarole of flying dude there and driving back yeah but that she doesn't bother me alright whatever that's what I gotta do I'll go do that I mean yeah that's you you choose how you handle things yeah yeah Eric was like I would be so pissed I'm like what's the point what it
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
point of being mad really about anything?
00:06:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's like, and then I wrote some really great lyrics on the ride home. So there you go. I was looking at them this this morning and then someone sent Dan Burks and a new song and I was like, oh, I think those are going to work. Here we go. So there you go.
00:06:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're lining. Yes, that there always is one. I really always this one. So during COVID, I got my daughter access to masterclass and they had some dog training stuff in there and she did that with my havinies. It was a little punk and he so healing, sitting, staying, and there's something called door dashing like when the door opens, they run off the door and he doesn't do that anymore. So I don't know if Mario would be interested in training Zinnia and you're getting like an online thing.
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I got a different trainer for the puppy and Denise and Mario lasted approximately one lesson. And then they're like, I don't want to do it again. like, well, then I'm doing it because this is not happening. Yeah. I had an hour lesson with her yesterday and Belle did great.
00:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Aw.
00:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay. Yeah. okay, good. We talked about last week, I need to, I probably should go back and remember that it, but talking about, I think I probably just need to do that because my brain is like not dialing into the details of it. And my AR notes aren't good enough about this section, but basically scope of support and creating an SOP for like you were saying, I don't remember who did it. I guess it. was Glenn, I think it was Glenn, where Vijay and Abhishek did things that they shouldn't have done and it was a lot. so how even did it get to them in the first place?
00:08:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So in reality, Bobby's the one that stopped because he kind of okayed it.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's what I was asking is what's the routing process?
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how did the ticket come in?
00:08:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Who saw it? How did he get to Abhishek and Vijay? Exactly. That comes into the desk. Typically, Bobby is the first person to get on any tickets. I never do. Sometimes, sometimes they'll tag me in for whatever reason. Eric, Sometimes it's tagged in, but usually Bobby's the first person to touch it. Maybe they're trying to get him or not entirely shown.
00:09:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Typically. So is that not even a standardized process? Yeah, I guess so because I asked you a question, you said typically Bobby's the one that sees the tickets first. so you said typically that makes me ask, is that even a standardized process who's checking and who's assigning and who's accountable?
00:09:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I think they all are assigned to him. So buy him.
00:09:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is the volume of tickets?
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, like, one a week, maybe.
00:10:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Glenn asked for something and Bobby said, okay, and sent it to Avishak and Vijay, basically.
00:10:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Not realizing what he was asking for was more than what it seemed. Because the framing of it was, oh, yeah, just take this funnel and make it that funnel. Bobby didn't realize, like, yeah, that's part of it. But then you also need a new calendar. You also need a new automation. also need to tell you also, right? So it was like, it was the behind this. It was like the underlying functionality that was time absorbent, not the, like, duplicate this funnel.
00:10:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is part of the. the process be then if there's a technical request that comes in that whoever assigned it, like, let's just say it's Bobby for right now, which long term probably is not the best thing. But if it goes to a dev team saying, what is the scope of this, like, what is involved and if they say, okay, we think it's this, this is how long it would take, then whoever comes back and says, okay, this falls within your scope of support, anything beyond. Like, if you have additional requests or we find out that it needs more, how, I'm just trying to figure out how would we word the contingencies, the, the qualifier.
00:11:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, so Bobby's working on that.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he's like, and we had started this many moons ago, right?
00:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it was like, this is included, this isn't. So if it comes in and you're like, oh, yeah, that's, you know, we could. categorize it at that point or tag it and go content update, you know, site update, content update, new page, right? All the stuff that's included is that. And then we do these other included things like monthly plug in and we're pressed like that's all non-request based. So if you look at the tickets that come in are three kinds. Update content, which is all we ever get from Mark or Isaac really. Customer support, like I just bought strong marriage now and I can't log in. So we handle that, we'll forget those but Rebecca actually does that so we have her in there because they have their own help desk person but she uses the centralized help desk. And then the third one would be, I mean an example would be length. thing, which to me would be new components. But you could also, what would also fall in that not covered category would be new landing page, new form, stuff like that.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which I'm new name.
00:13:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, just very specific, right? a new content page? Sure, yeah, that's going to be an opt-in page and a new form, the most negative. What they were requesting was a new funnel, like straight up. And it was like a book, a call funnel, you could call it, right? was. Yeah, it was like, yeah, was a book, I would call it a call funnel, which we, they had one. So they were right and like, oh yeah. We just want to make another version of this, but there's no, it's not cut and paste at all. Well, I mean, parts of it on, they don't know that. So their interpretation of this cut and paste, whole thing done. And I think Bobby's interpretation was also cut and paste. Oh, yeah. And he just set to damage it to BJ. And then they came back, they don't question anything, right? They just do, which is very developer-y.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, done. We're gonna get it done.
00:14:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they got it done. And then it was like, oh, PS that took 10 hours. And Bobby was like, wait, what? Which in the grants do you know things? It's not that big a deal, right? Because most of the time we get zero requests from Glen and Ross. So we're just making 700 bucks a month, doing nothing.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
except there an allotment of developer time that a person can have. So let's say all of the requests.
00:15:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, they get none.
00:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:15:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They only get what they get and there's no custom anything. There's no whatever. It's like, hey, you get these things. So, and there's no limit. Like, you could add plenty of new content pages, but no one's ever going to do that. So it could be later on, we change that button right now. It's like all framing and do like set it and forget it. Like, you don't need to be adding blog posts or if you do, you can do it or we can do it. So, those guys were, they'll also add like a product here or there and that's like super simple. So that's included. It's like, oh, they want to add. They always do some weird . Oh, you know, need a 3K 150 month. All right. Well, no, I mean, fine.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a good perspective. Is there a due date for Bobby having this documented?
00:16:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've missed the meeting on Monday, so I don't know where it's at. I I think his first line was just going to dig up what we already did. I feel like it's already done. We just didn't really. We got to figure out, like, I guess, in a way to help us do this. Hey, a call bundle takes 10 hours. So therefore, the price of a call bundle is 10 times the hourly rate that we already have, which I don't know at the top of my hand. I want to say it's like $90.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I feel like I remember. like two years ago maybe that you had a price chart for hourly rates.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yep we have it if you're looking somewhere and probably it's based on Abhishek and DJ's black quilts like Greg's.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Anyways, of time right?
00:17:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah or they buy the thing. So we say okay it's gonna cost this. So some stuff you would just need little pre-priced. Hey a new landing page of form is this. Hey a new funnel book a call funnel is this. A new sales funnel, three steps sales funnel thing. And then we could have these things pre-built as important templates from the basis cloud library. just don't because we can't build them yet. Because that part doesn't work. Because the theme isn't done right?
00:17:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
guys are fixing another dragon.
00:17:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. My version of it, it's like, hey, we would have the Cloud Library template of, hey, this is a automatic customer funnel. But they're going to charge them what we're going to charge them, and the fact that we have a Cloud template, not their concern. We built it, we use it, you still pay 900 bucks or whatever it is.
00:18:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is named Frank back from vacation.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think he got back.
00:18:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he gave some deadlines of when he thinks the first thing will be done, but you think it'll be done soon. I'm trying to remember what the first thing was.
00:18:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I had it written down. He wants the wolf or site.
00:19:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no, the first thing was to build the wolf or side on 2.0 Oh, you just like got really far away or muffled or something He wanted the wolf or site built on basis 2.0 But he didn't know it was already done.
00:19:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I didn't either. I was like, I think that's done But I don't I'm not I'm not gonna say that on this call And then I think I have to check me to let him know, but he was on vacation. So they were like, hey, we already did that So we're gonna go work on this stuff What's next? They just start working on the theme And they sent the code For review, I think they tagged in Nario Then they sent it to Frank. So ultimately Frank is like, hey, I want a code review before I get it and then when I get it we're gonna come in I get it and review it and it's good It'll get committed for there literally are waiting for Frank And does he have it Huh, huh yes, yes, okay, yes Or like it's in the get waiting Oh What's what's the status of brain tree and moving and all of that There Eric was all pumped So he thought he had it solved and then this morning reset you got hit again It's like oh well not solved But no one else is getting hit. It's just reset you now so that makes me think that Ross or Glenn's admin is compromised. So I was like they don't need to be admin. So we removed that like an hour ago and then I was going to look at one thing, but I didn't have a chance to look at it yet. We installed this, we installed two plugins, but one looks for attacks and the other, like, logs a bunch of activity. So they're, like, getting in through an admin, it should show up in there. But there's also the idea that they were already logged in. And they just, so then we just unlocked, we logged everyone out. It moves WP log in. So if they were going straight in, or were already logged in, now they should be logged out. And then if Glenn and Ross were compromised, they no longer have.
00:21:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was one of the main things that I learned a long time is a long time ago is not have WP admin as the login, like, we would use secret link or something like that.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
instead of it.
00:22:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that there are zero admin accounts like the admin default is changed to something else. So that anything that's default basically got changed to something else.
00:22:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then prank was like you need to rotate your admin password like every 60 days. And we should use this thing called one pass. We don't log in. We log in through WP Manage or I do. So then I was like, everyone just needs to use that. We just change WP Manage. Okay, breaking up so bad and trying to figure out what you're saying.
00:22:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I got the gist of it. He said change your passwords every couple of months or six months? 60 days. 60 days. Okay, that I was like, it sounded like two. I remember a six, okay, that was every 60 days and he said use one pass and you said you log in through Managed WPAs, WPAs. So you don't have to get rid of rain tree?
00:23:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Known at this point. Okay. Maybe it seems like a maybe we can if no one else has gotten hit, which makes me think that there's and the Presidium guys did find malicious code on reset. You and they didn't find any on other sites. So it could be that they're only able to get into that site through whatever backdoor they created.
00:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You Well, hopefully that gets fixed. Oh yeah, where are we at with more surf stuff?
00:24:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just finished. We are advanced. No, it's not done. And halfway through is a Google analytics board. And beyond. But finished the first two sort of. The steps of. Yeah, like their. Valley and now I'm moving into. The next level. I'm doing the GA for one. Right now. and then he has like a GTM advanced that I'm doing after today probably and then uh there's like uh oh there's uh oh and then I hit up Melissa and was like hey are you out there she's like yes but i'm on vacation of course you are in european that's what you people do uh so she got back from vacation today maybe they all go away at the same time uh and I sent her all of his stuff so he has like two forces whatever right so he has like two it's really two videos he has two videos on looker from their kind of point of view and then he has um those reports his eye on the journey Report thing and they have all these graphics that are like pre-built for you that you can use start like hey Log in here. Watch these Then I want to build these reports. I set up a bunch of the events for it. I think correctly and then let me know when you're done and We'll take the next step. So shoot price started looking at that yesterday Okay Okay, so oh no, I'm sorry today today. She's back today Sent it to her yesterday What would she be doing is like creating your version of the report for you? Yeah, yeah, she's she does all of our GDS stuff So she built like that that screen cap I sent you the other day of that report.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's all her You built that What screen cap of a report did you send the new subs and new cancellations? I don't remember seeing a report.
00:27:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you didn't look then. And what's the report was like, there's like, there's a graph.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yes, chart chart chart. Okay.
00:27:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have a bunch of different charts in Google data studio that are based off of blue data and gravity data. We don't have anything that's, you know, extending Google analytics or not Google on the floor. But she's our, she's our go to for that. And I think like, you know, it's going through this course. I set up the variables to do or to mail or get the variables and the parameters or whatever. I said all those up to be able to do it for two journeys. it's sort of the path. the journey path to purchase so which path will they go down and then just like the straight product journey which would be a product checkout purchase so those should all exist as data in Googling will explore now for like you know only like a week or whatever but and then they'll just continue to accrue.
00:28:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you describe those journeys again path to purchasing straight product journey.
00:28:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So path would be the go to the two paths page then they go down one of the paths of winner ninja only then they go to the product page and then they check out the other journey is that they start on the product page and then they check out or everyone that goes to the product page so even if they came from a path I just want to see hey what happens or project project page on and then I can connect to build three journeys so it would be path one path to and then like home page button to product page which is the probably the most popular way people get there.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is it like a I don't know like a goal setting kind of like with behavioral so I'm not referencing GA for because I haven't used it but previous google analytics you could map out goals and they had customer behavior where you could look at their journeys from where they entered this page this page. So no, what does this look like? Like in a layman's professor?
00:29:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah yeah so what you are talking about doesn't exist anymore at all. So everything in GA4 is event based. So, like of those reports, I'm firing events for those steps, but then in order to visualize it and see it as like a funnel or see a breakdown of people going through each individual step, right? let's say, hey, how many people hit the product page? Well, that event is product page, page view event. So, it would take that level and be like, okay, you had 100 people, this is the product page. So, instead of it being URL base, like it was in J4, you're using events and the reason you're using events is because they can only fire once, right? So, you don't have to worry about, oh, did this person come to get, right? The page views are not really page views, whatever, it's really like this many, it was 100 people, 100 events fired on this thing, conceivably. And then you'd say, then you have multiple events on the page. So, then the next event is add to cart, or the next event is, you know, you can have multiple events. so, you're doing, you're doing, we have a report based on the events. And then you can put it together by like, OK, event one is page view of path page. Event two is page view event of path one. And then event three is page view, obviously, this person above the priority, right? This page view of product page. then the next one is page view of checkout. And the next one is page view of purchase page. So then you could say, OK, show me that. Show me the breakdown of that in percentages. So he has like, one side is just like the numbers. OK, 10% of the people saw the page one. And 20% went to path one. And 80% went to path two. And then you can start. And you start basically right now, we're just establishing a baseline. Like, I need to know what's actually happening. And then. And then he's got some like, he says, oh, what's his number? He's, I'm going say his, he says that everyone's card should be 10% add to card. It's not like that. He's like, we've done so many sites and you'd average as 10% if you're not getting 10%. That's where you start. You should start figuring out why you're not getting 10%. So we get the number. And then we see, are we 10, are 20, are we 2? Then that's the right side of the screen. And then the right side of the screen is more of like an actual funnel visualization. And it's showing you going through the steps of the funnel, but his funnel is that those eyes, impression, interest, interaction, whatever the five eyes are. And then those events are separate events. could, you can have some of them might be like impressions is the same impressions, but then interest is hey, they scrolled and saw the variations or they, whatever you decide. So I don't have those ones set up yet, because I have to figure out what they are.
00:33:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I love this. mean, because how many times have you talked about how much the data matters and that's. Um, so does it have a built in heat map where you can see the activity or the equivalent through the events, like can an event be mouse over the cart button or, um, to a certain page or click or hover or things like that?
00:33:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So like one of his events for like interest would be, um, scrolled to make this up, right? And was at that location for four seconds or more. So then that event would fire. He's like that shows that there's interest and you can sort of Find these events right find those more specific events by Watching like clarity videos or whatever, right? You might go watch a bunch of clarity videos and go Oh, there are people doing this like I should I should track that. I should see You know, whatever whatever it is. I'm good example But your example is correct, right? You would define The add to cart button is like, okay, they or the for us it would be like the Drop-down menu of sections, right? like oh, went to this they stayed in that sections area for this long So they were thinking about it or and then or maybe you can find an event like they interacted with that menu That's gonna get more into this advanced GTM. That's part of a gun to that's where you start writing your own JavaScript and you're and you're firing events using JavaScript based on Thumbs up so but other stuff like scrolls already built in so you can Take the scroll data that's already there and then you're going to marry that with Hover and whatever that's not built in There's a bunch of basic stuff that's built in you just have to turn it on That sounds so awesome Yeah, he's definitely it's definitely been demystified. I'm like, I'm almost there. I'm like, okay.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm starting to pick it up now That's good And I love that you had Melissa because with Google Data Studio like it should provided the the new framework right the user interface um is being understood she should be able to be useful in So you being able to say which is to me the main goal of you having enough of a technical understanding of what needs to be done in the business to hire and choose the experts to actually do the thing, work in the business, and also to be informed enough to direct them specifically to the most leveraged activity, which I think is, you know, like Melissa, you have Norio the code overlord and Frank and Melissa for analytics and Bobby for meeting management and conversation, so that is to me the way that, so I was, I started EMeth again because I have Mark and the guy who referred me to reading that, and so I was just, I'm like, well, it's been like 12 years, I should read it again, and I was looking at that going, I was listening, thing just in the very beginning and thinking about the 30,000 foot view that they start describing about what needs to happen in the business and then I'm thinking like why am I not out of business yet and other people doing this stuff and then I heard the thing and it was like this is always the issue with EOS, EMITH, with any of these things is that the work that I do and the way that it's work with are different is that we want the good business practices and the good business systems and it lines up with a lot of that but we want and prioritize freedom over time and who we work with above profits like for Mark his priority is I don't want to go to the office if I don't want to go to the even if I don't want to go in for a month. He wants to work, he wants to have his business, he wants to have it profitable, but come hell or high water, he's going to figure out how to do that without having to be in the office for a month if he doesn't want to go in for a month.
00:38:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's new.
00:38:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and that's why I'm having conversations, because I'm like, he's definitely not there.
00:38:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I don't remember hearing that before. No, I definitely did not exist before.
00:38:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it does. And the thing is that there are always trade-offs, but these trainings don't talk about human trade-offs and making anything that's other than prioritizing the absolute best health of the business rather than the absolute highest value of the visionary being that which is what I'm always going for. And because a lot of the times we do think like for you, it's pace. Like that is more important to you, I think, than well, then then profit, but so is no drama. So not feeling like things are stressing you out either because of the people that you're dealing with or making yourself go, you know, this is the deadline. It's the deadline. It's got to be the deadline. Realizing that deadlines are arbitrary anyway, really. It's this because we said it's this and it should be this, which is what happens most of time, the same with financial goals. That's what most businesses live and die by. And even an email, and he's like, and it's hard work, but it's worth it. And I'm like, it depends on who you ask. And how hard it is. Like, so none of us are opposed to work. We all work. We work consistently. something we show up all the time. But I think it's kind of almost the obsession level and the required discipline. Like even, oh, what's his face? see it. It's the profit profit first. Yeah. Yeah. What? So none.
00:40:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's creating a job.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, oh, I'm never doing that. None of these, to me, are the simplest forms of success. Right. There is always extra and and they talk about the 80-20 rule, but I don't think that they really understand it or they they just overcomplicate it because We really don't have to have that much organization and structure. The bottom line is what are your most profitable activities, effective hourly rate, that kind of math, right? And what are the things that have to be done in the business or it fails to exist or it diminishes that is tedious and takes the visionary away from the most profitable activities. Those are two massive leverage points. Number one, you spending more time doing the most profitable thing, which almost always is also the thing that people love most. That's why it became the most profitable thing because you loved it first and we're good at it, almost always. In fact, I have not seen an exception yet. And the other one is as quickly as possible and creating a path to this if it doesn't exist. all the other things that pull you off of that off of your plate on someone else's. Specifically, someone who can work autonomously and not need to be micromanaged or anything like that. To me, those are the first two levers to go after. And then systematizing inside of that. But mostly, it's just a huge awareness of the greatest value in the business, starting with human resources, starting with the visionary, depending on how small it is. And then a single person of support in the highest level. So like Seth Ellsworth, his biggest person would be a salesperson, or a lead generator. The next biggest person would be an automations person, because what he does is largely automations. For Mark, Mary, um looking in the documents or looking at some of the reports and managing managing the people being available frequently and then having attorneys over their pods just being better leaders has you know those are his leverage points for you a developer because so much of it is technical and then a person to track tasks and move them forward and not necessarily a single person in any of these things but those are leverages and so you know there are things to glean from email from bill to sell from EOS but yeah anyway just contemplating all of that and but but things like that so you understanding going for a full circle how staying on top of technology has been a massive lever for me is for you, too, because the technology itself is the lever. So GA for being able to provide so much data, but the first thing is you have to wrap your head around GA4 and how it works in order to unlock the gift that it has in its data. And knowing most people will never do that, most people are just kind of going in the dark because they don't have good data, they don't know where to get it, or they won't put the effort in if they do know where to get it. anyway, you just leveled our leopard game, that was a long way to say that's what you just did.
00:44:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, I just come back, it's like, it's the age old thing. It's like, there is no system, there's no system. Not working a system and there's no system if you're not building a system. So I'm like, you gotta build the system first and then work it So I'm no problem and usually where people fall down is they never build the system So it's like, you know, you didn't set the weather. It's like he hasn't built the the way to get an automations person in there, right? and it's like oh, yeah, you're gonna build that mark but it's funny about mark is like The other day was like, hey, I think you need to start recognizing that and your right hand not Mary Here we go Salka's getting deeper and deeper in there.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would like to hear more of that.
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What how He's deeper and deeper in there like he's interacting with Sam and Are you saying Salka is the right hand? Salka was saying that he said that to mark. He's like you need to Start recognizing that like I'm your right hand not Mary And that his right hand needs to be someone like Salko, not Mary, because Salko can go into an arbitration. Salko can go in and tell Sam, hey, no, you're doing that wrong. And like level up the things that matter. Mary's more like a ops person. It's like, no, should just be the, like, I think you just nailed it. Like, she's the one that should be looking at dashboards. That's not Salko's gig. You should be the one that's like, hey, your leads are down. Hey, retainers are off pace. Hey, but you know, calls going out is low, right there. But you know, our job, you know, is getting those metrics in place to be established and be then set that baseline and say this equals that. Therefore, if this is not happening, then that is not going to happen. And I think I actually had Josh did something with phone calls that he sent me. I haven't looked at it yet. Because I started, look, I started wondering about that. like, okay, if we can't track an intake person, which we can't, which I understand, because they don't don't get assigned the lead. That totally makes sense. It's like, well, they all do the same thing. They all make calls. So there's got to be a relationship between all volume and whatever, right? what was the differentiator about July? What made July different than every other July before it, right? Part of it was lead sources. But like, what even the best lead source hit the bend. So it's like, well, it wasn't just that, right? Like, and what's really great about it was like, in the mark three years ago, monkey did that to him three years ago in July. Totally different stories being told at that point. You're like five alarm fire, we're at, because we got zero retainers this month, right? like, he would have been like, so underwater. And I was like, no, that's not you can now have your best lead source totally crap out on you.
00:48:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and you set a and you set a record. And that is the leverage.
00:48:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's a risk. Yep.
00:48:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're welcome. Mark. Right. Thank you. Because he's like, well, because he didn't even have a system for it. He didn't have a schedule for it. He didn't, whatever. I'm like, who goes and buys new vendors? do. do you do that? How often? Well, um, like, okay. Yeah. Yep. All these things. Um, hold on. Let me. Oh, you were so lead. Let's talk about mom for a little bit. I have to cut off right at one. Um, unless there's something else you'd rather talk about.
00:49:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Another Sunday one's just chugging along it's high season and we're just I'm it's all It's me just figuring out this the analytics piece is gonna unlock it all I'm about to ask ask Mercer my first question yesterday, which is something missing in their training some of their trainings old I'm like, hey, this doesn't exist anymore. I Don't even really need the thing, I'm wondering if they have an answer and then I'll get to this other bit And then I'm gonna hit them with my KPI. Hey Let's say I want to try new customers. I still got to get that answer But that's gonna be my big question for them. The rest all make sense And I'm just gonna go on the Legos in place. We just had an hour and a half long call about mom.
00:49:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So go. Oh Yeah, huh. Yeah.
00:49:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, got moved to today.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh Yeah, cuz well our last call was an hour and a half also Cuz time flies I'm like I was this call almost was over already. Um, what was I? Oh, yeah. Okay. So another 71, that was kind of why I wasn't pausing on that because because of the analytics. And I already asked you about record stuff and just seeing what's going on there. But I haven't asked about mom in a couple of weeks, other than you know, was Mark working on the book. And I don't remember your answer, but basically they're doing other things.
00:50:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, the book is done. It needs to be edited. And then Katie comes back on Monday, so I'm going to yank around the side and be like, I need you to help me edit this book. So her and her husband will probably help me edit the book and then the book will be done done. So that'll probably be done hopefully, you know, next seven to ten days from Monday.
00:50:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what's next?
00:50:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then I'm going to revisit like all the all the checklists. So we had like a release checklist, that checklist, I gotta make sure all those are up to snuff, you know, as far as Greg goes, because I think he made one, but I don't think he made them all. Make sure those are done and then sort of revisit the mom's site and be like, okay, now let's make it really show what we do. So I was on a call with them today, and Sean's label wants to sell land, so they acquired Lansdown's catalog as part of being signed to the label. And now the heads of the label got ousted, he literally just texted me that because I'm like, what's going on? So they got, they were like, hey, you can buy your catalog back. And they want to charge them 250 grand, which I just went on Chats UPT for like a while, and I was messing around. The value of the catalog. like is way higher than that based on what Chechi PT was saying, right? Me going, Hey, how do you do this? How do you do that? What's a multiple, right? So I got to verify some of that stuff, but it, you know, as Chechi PT does, I'm like, Oh, that's not real. Like, I don't know if this is real, but. And then I was querying it, whatever. So there, there's definitely like a formula that you could use. So of course, Mark home, you know, home run, Grand Slam. Grand Slam is like, Hey, we could go around and start buying other outer catalogs will go get investments money and blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, bro, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like, why don't we go back to AFM, which is Sean's label and we make them an owner finance offer. So we buy lands down catalog back. It'll be money down into paying interest rate, firms with a payout by whatever, they'll get a monthly, a guaranteed monthly payment. And then we have some sort of bio clause that we can buy out whatever because my Arc was showing me and Spotify what happened with his band, so he's been playing around with Cross-McTill using some of the fan flowy stuff. And their streams are just like going up and up and up and up. But they are nowhere near as big as Lansdowne. And then this other band that we work with, they signed with a company called Amuse, which is sort of like what we're doing. And those guys went and started promoting non-point, and their streams started going up. And Amuse is getting a chunk of that revenue. So they're like, Lansdowne has better bass numbers than both of those bands. And what a shock Tina, Lansdowne has never used any of the fan flowy stuff. Because why would you when it's right there in front of you for free? So, of course, today they're like, do you want to buy Lansdowne's catalog of like no? But after I did the whole thing, I was like, wait a minute. Like, what if, Angela, what if mom bought Lansdowne's catalog, owner financed, right? Don't, none of this go out and raise capital because you're just inviting people in that you don't want around in 10 years. Like, so you go in and your owner financed it. And I, with GPT, I was like, hey, how long has Spotify been around? So I sort of came up with this custom formula that says, well, Spotify might not be around in 20 years. So don't give me evaluation on 20 years. But the calculation that I did give me, it was saying, which I do feel it could be pretty valid. just got to go, you know, find something. And it had like, oh, this source, this source, this source. So it might mean some tweaks, but, you know, over a 10-year period, it was saying that the stream revenue is worth, which is based on actual Spotify data, that it's worth 1.5 million. I was like, okay, so if we can come up with that formula and then we can actually figure out like what it's worth, then you could go do this with other bands. You go to the whoever owns the catalog and you just keep doing these owner fine hand steals. Like, hey, we want to buy this one for that and then you bring them in and then you put your promotion engine behind it and then whatever those numbers were, they're wrong because you're now going to increase all that revenue, but you're going to do it to an asset that you already own. So I like, all right, that's kind of interesting. That's like building this asset, like this recurring revenue asset that can go out 10, 15, 20 years and then God forbid, one of these bands breaks, like, all right, yep, we need to look into that. So we got our first there, Sean and Eric are setting up the staff stuff tomorrow. We're bringing on a DIY client, it's going to be the first person to like, just, he's going to pay, I think, $97 a month and he's just doing it himself. So what he wanted, he was like, when can we get access to this? he's going to be our little beta tester. Norio, I got to send him a video today. I don't do right after this. So he has, he needs some help with his. He's building this song lookup app for us that uses this service called song link. That's part of the onboarding that we have. It's part of the promotion engine that we need the artist to be able to quickly get all the links for all the streaming services by searching their song. He's building that, those search their song. They go, yeah, that's it. And then it will update like 10 custom fields inside their account. So they could do that for like up to three. So we promote retell them to pick three songs. So hopefully when I send him today, we're. Yeah. Hopefully when I send table, get him over the hub and then he's going to look at this DNS app that we might build is the biggest sort of hurdle for use or so far has been getting their DNS setup. They're like, OK, not going to go, daddy. Hey, person, there's no idea what we're talking about. Go in and add this MX record, that MX record. Oh, yeah. Yeah, good luck. So people are just borking on that. And Mark found this software that looks like it's exactly what it does. And they have an API and all that good . I'm going to kick that to my own next.
00:57:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll your MX records for what they need to be.
00:57:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does it all. Yeah, it's just it's wizard or fives setting up all your DNS.
00:57:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you just give it like a registrar or something or how does it.
00:57:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. No, you give it your domain name and then using their app, you're already approved with like Wix. And like so many of these people are using Wix or bought their domain through Wix and then never built the site. And high level only works with like GoDaddy and CloudFlare, which some we had. Some people use GoDaddy, but, you know, if they have Dane, whatever, this, this middleware works with anybody. So then you, when you're authorized through them as fan flowy, then you're authorized to go in there at the DNS records on all those other providers. the person is just, you know, essentially. So like MailChimp uses them as an example, one of the big clients is MailChimp. So anyone that goes on MailChimp and needs to update their domain, they're going through MailChimp's app that's using this third party.
00:58:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then the third party goes. You don't have to log into your register.
00:58:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, I get the access.
00:58:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do you validate that somebody actually owns that domain?
00:58:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like, what is the verification process? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I haven't, I just looked at to go play with it, play with the API, and then he'll come back and go, all right, this is how it's going to work.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will check because if they have that kind of permission, I mean, our is your domain safe. If anybody can get into it without.
00:59:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
If it might be that they do just log into our login and it passes it all through. That would make sense. That's probably how it works. So you're like not oh, I think, but it's sort of like that.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Like plaid or something like that.
00:59:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a good example. It's probably like that. They probably pull from a drop down. It's probably very much like plaid. And they just have every frickin provider. And then they can go in. Yeah, it's good. I was like, oh, that's interesting. But it would totally solve the problem.
00:59:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not paying attention to the time.
00:59:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
got to pay attention to the time. right.
00:59:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then that app.
00:59:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then I just reached out to the follower flow. guys for an update and haven't gotten an update. And the Spotify app no update waiting for that I think that's gonna take like two more weeks Until we get an answer if yes or no or nothing.
01:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what you said last week.
01:00:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's five weeks total So, okay, I think I still do the date. I say in the date. So five weeks or whatever the date I said you is most likely when we're gonna hear back.
01:00:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, I kind of recall that Yeah, um, oh what I was gonna ask Was next steps, but oh no, okay, so let me just say this because I do have to go but What you were talking about with chat DPT and its calculations And I know your brain already goes here, but the thing that I was thinking is how do you validate its formula and you would have to know what its formula is but if you understood its formula and you could validate it by Whatever it's playing data from and however it's making its calculations but basically replicate that formula, those calculations, that outcome so that you understood it and could verify that it works, then you've got a solid valuation process that you can be using for potentially purchasing other catalogs or helping people to sell their catalogs as a service or just another way for mom to generate revenue, but it just really stood out to me that having a formula like that would be really powerful.
01:01:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what I said to it. I was like, I want to build a formula for this and then it added some stuff. go, well, I don't think Spotify has only been around, you know, Spotify has been around whenever I go, yeah, but how long is it number one? And it's like, oh, it's only the number one since the late 2010, like, oh, great. So now we're going to use that. So let's say, you can't say, you can't give me a calculation based on 2020. years is when I'd be around 20 years.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, you make a good point. We have to consider that they won't be the market leader. like, right?
01:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it can't it literally created like a point system, like based on the age of the band, the age of the band's catalog, the number, whatever. So I need to get it to like integrate some other things. But then the math of Spotify or a stream is 100 percent correct, like 0.004, like it's some ridiculous number. So yeah. Now the question is, will the label go for our finance? don't see why they wouldn't. It's positive cash flow. Right.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to pause the questions that are popping up my brain so I can keep to my schedule. But it just goes so fast. So many things to ask and then anyway. Have a good day. Take care of yourself.

Two Mark sweets.
00:00:01 - mark sweet
Yeah, I wasn't sure which one was right. So that's all right.
00:00:10 - mark sweet (3)
I just don't know one. They're just down just to one me.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just you. That's OK. I just got up with Fuji this back to back meeting. I'm not used to it. And I'm like, I got to go.
00:00:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, he was asking me a question about multiple company names or a different company name for each day. what we have, if that wasn't really helpful. But his situation is a little different than mine because the tracking by a doctor name, not the only reason we have different companies for different states is more because of our trust account and because each day has different laws where it's a little different for him. So I mean, I'm the whole, it's better. But I don't think it's going to make a big difference.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like. like um oh so I got to flip something for him. love when people think one thing about their business and then I'm like oh we go do some math and then you find out it's not that at all so July is actually way profitable way more profitable for him than Q and P.
00:01:18 - mark sweet (3)
Good.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's pretty cool.
00:01:21 - mark sweet (3)
One quick thing from the legal side though just in a facamot, the CUNY practice that's legitimacy to his personal injury stuff.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh I'm not telling him he shouldn't do it. Okay. That was a nice like exciting thing for him to know that July was actually like that.
00:01:38 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah yeah good tea faces.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh you guys always join on video and Fuji he said that it's more intimidating but like accountability so he's like I like when you're there because like I feel like I've got a I don't know pay attention so I think facial expressions which makes a difference rather than just seeing if on the earth. It's not okay.
00:02:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)

It's it's it's always going to be about the promise. And say it from the beginning, he who engineers the promise wins. But the adoption rate by, you know, the general public is already on the decline. It only ever really hit 5%. And it's on the decline. So they're like, or this 's not, no one's going to use it. Most people don't even know what it is. They don't even know who the vice president is. And now she's running for president.
00:03:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They still don't know who she is.
00:03:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She doesn't know. That's fine. And it's like, but, you know, there's the whole strawberry thing that just went around, right? couldn't count the R's and strawberry. It got it. If you ask Chachi B, Chachi Bt4, how many R's are in strawberry? it will tell you to right now. They haven't even fixed it. It's like, you should probably go fix that one. No, it can't do simple things. But that being said, I was talking to this buddy of mine.
00:04:15 - mark sweet (3)
The stuff that we've done that's really interesting is. I like fixed it. Now says the worst draw right contains three R letters.
00:04:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There you go. It literally didn't work yesterday.
00:04:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is it for me?
00:04:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Really?
00:04:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:04:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See, it's not trustworthy. But if the stuff that we've done that's interesting is giving it the data set. So I think it's called RAG. I think the three letter thing is called RAG. And it's like, you're basically giving it a data set and then using it for its large language modeling against the data set that you trust, that you've said, hey, this is the thing. So it's good at that. And then if you, and if you then have it, you're updating that data set and or you're creating an application with it so that it remembers things and all that good stuff, then you're on another level. Then it can work. But what most people are doing is just like API and into chat, GPT. And it's like, yeah, not great.
00:05:25 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the training the models were people are missing the huge problem. I agree with you, but it's time consuming and boring.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but most people second communicating and the way to make chat GPT work really well is to give excellent parameters. It's not just the prompting. It's the parameters of the prompting. Here are the boundaries. Also, here is the level of effort that you need to apply. So like if you ask at a basic thing, it puts forth basic effort. If you say, I want you to apply it as though you're this person using this logic, there's parameters, right? Completely different type of output. So like it said, there are two R's and I said try again and instead I apologize, there are three R's. So the other thing is you need to build in a check and balance system. So like I just told Fuji, I said go do your reports. I said, but then, because he's like, I'll use chat GPT do this. I said, okay, but then you need to go validate the data and make sure that what it told you is correct. And you can offer it for formulas and things like that. But the other part is most people aren't building in a check and balance system. I mean, have it in our government and not that it works, but whatever. there are also need to be something and that the problem is, and it's the same problem in every kind of business as people don't delegate. They, the hell is the word? You just give it off to people and you forget about it. My brain, I know this word is driving me nuts. Abdicate, people abdicate. So as soon as there is somebody that they think, can or will or something handle a problem for them. It isn't delegation. They just stop thinking about it. That's how embezzlement happens. That's how a lot of things happen. It's because people advocate, oh, this is my person for this. This is my system for this. It works. But we all know nobody and no thing works the same all the time. Life happens, human error, system error, economical error, whatever. So whatever system they build, there needs to be a quality assurance kind of check and balance system that gets built into it and whatever. It's not just about chat TBT and why I'm going off about all of this, but this is the thing that destroys a lot of businesses and a lot of more people when they get to the point where I can pay to delegate. Case in point, Mark, you haven't done anything bad, but I'm just saying this is the thing. You need to be a aware of in yourself don't how to keep the delegation right like we've had issues with our complaints and missing a statute because yeah so dealing with it yeah yeah delegating is one thing advocating is a thing you can't ever do and it has to be the most critical parts like why we why you resist the non-attorney model because attorneys have liability right and it's not just you owning all the liability you have somebody else in there that's got skin in the game and that's important because that that keeps a layer of protection against you strategically and i agree with that so the one interesting thing that keeps coming up and dandy you probably know more about this than i do is they're having these bots listening in on the calls for tonal shifts and for I guess voice for lack of very term is the person sound happy to add positive for us
00:09:00 - mark sweet (3)
some of these things. And obviously they're trying to pressure their problem like flags the call for a manager or supervisor to listen to it, whether it's a training issue or potentially an upset client or what happened.
00:09:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way it's listening to the tone.
00:09:14 - mark sweet (3)
No way.
00:09:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No disagree with you.
00:09:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure they're saying it. It would have to be a third party. They're not doing it.
00:09:25 - mark sweet (3)
They're using something that's already done it. If anything. Yeah.
00:09:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's probably more based on stop words than tone, right? Because just think the individual aspect of people's voices in general, right? how people speak differently. whether it's like people can't even pick out sarcasm text. People can't pick out sarcasm voice. Top words. Words of frustration. Words of anxiety. Words of that all day long. can see that being more effective than. and then looking for a tone or trying to identify tone. It could be a combination of the two, maybe, but I bet it leans more towards the word itself first.
00:10:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do think it's the word. So right now Chat TBT can tell you the tone of words, text. it does that. don't think it's, and also how much you can pick up sarcasm, especially thick sarcasm. I don't know how good it's at that. But the thing is, if people keep it in perspective, and this is what I think most people won't do, which is actually a benefit to all the other people who are going to be smart, is that you take it as a potential data point to go, like basically a flicker to go say, what's happening over here and go listen to it yourself and go, is this right? than I'm going to go and this is a problem person because Chat TBT keeps saying all their people are angry. angry and maybe it just can't even recognize it right or whatever.
00:11:03 - mark sweet (3)
You be able to figure out something like yelling or screaming.
00:11:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's it's going to be in this middleware. They're putting a middleware in place. I don't think that's yeah, I don't think that that's necessarily native to Chad GPT. So, I don't know if it's something else. It is. That's all anyone's using.
00:11:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, we'll see it open AI. That's what Chad GPT is, but it's open AI. it's all it's going to be so interesting, but keeping here's what we're talking We're talking and you're interrupting you.
00:11:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That don't track anything.
00:11:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't track anything. It's important to keep everything in containers, but that's what to your point of tracking is it's easier to do when they're in containers. Right. Daniel.
00:12:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's all sizzle, right? It's typical lawyer , right? Those guys are the most easily sold people on Earth.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's It's unreal.
00:12:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I'm not very excited by Shawnee Ball. And I have no idea how to implement it, what it actually does in the background.
00:12:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and then they're not going to track it. So it's like, you don't even, if you did it, are attracted to what it is? Oh, yeah.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I'm pretty sure you got to have a lot of that to be an attorney, period, or just collectively coming from somebody that was one of my career choices.
00:12:45 - mark sweet (3)
There are multiple more to do this. Coquitos, one, apparently.
00:12:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What, Pekker? What?
00:12:52 - mark sweet (3)
a weird name that is.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
See you. Yeah, I just thought about it.
00:12:56 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are you looking at?
00:13:00 - mark sweet (3)
So, could you use a real-time AI system to analyze the live phone calls that take customer sentiment provide agents with live cushion and feedback, uses voice analysis, introvert motion, infuse like stress or enthusiasm. There's the observed.ai, does kind of the same thing.
00:13:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I don't think you need a real time, right? you could just find something that allowed you to download recordicals and mass-analyze those to like help nail a script first, right? Like, you know, they don't need like any or support yet, right? If you got a script that worked and you're like, okay, this script is solid. Now, the only way this script goes sideways is through the execution thereof. Therefore, now layer on something where you know it's not gonna try, it's just gonna sort of try to make them be more successful with the script, but maybe.
00:13:55 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe, I mean, the issue, and I'm sure we're coming up is these larger teams, right? Because if you've got, take, for example, and it's alerting you that Marie is not doing a good job for whatever reason, right? You would want someone to listen to it take it over because you could potentially have a large case, right, your hands. Doctors office was calling in super frustrated. You want to know right away rather than after the fact, after the problem.
00:14:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, so like, I like the large case, right? But that would be like a word that could be like a stopboard based thing too, right? It's like, hey, if they say UPS truck, 18 wheeler, you know, you're like, oh, those are like, not stop words, but those are like flag words. Uh oh, this could be a commercial, you know, that kind of thing. But that would be the extracted via the script, right? So there's where the script would come into play to then sort of like was Tina was saying, sort of like what I was saying, you're not writing a prompt, you're just making making data available to the prompt, that's the prompt will say, hey, I can use that. Hey, that's something that I'm supposed to be looking for, and then it does its thing.
00:15:11 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no, I mean, that was one big one. The other big one is, you know, even up does AI demand writing, which I don't know.
00:15:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that I can see for sure.
00:15:20 - mark sweet (3)
Makes sense.
00:15:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But you would do it, you could do that right now, but it's just a matter of you having a self, I mean, it seems like the, and this is what I literally was doing yesterday because, you know, I'm a loser. But I'm like, okay, I can just have the data in the Google sheet in like a row. And I just say, hey, this row. And I keep telling chat GPT, like, I don't need to build the database at this rate, but I need to someplace to store the data and say you're using this. Then it's a matter of like, you give it a demand. Let's say you get, let's. it's a demand for a dog bite or whatever, whatever it is, it's a car accident.
00:16:06 - mark sweet (3)
That's what we do.
00:16:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do a car accident. But like, give me an example of one where you'd be like, it's a tip, like the setup where like, this is the demand is based on these four or five things. Like, is there a scenario like that?
00:16:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So you're generally going to have liability. Number one, like, how did it happen? Who's that fault?
00:16:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay. So you're saying, yeah, injuries and injuries is the part you spend the most amount of time on.
00:16:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. Three state specific, which state did it happen in? And four is the rest of the board of plate template, quite frankly, you know, the terms and conditions and kind of the opening and just the boiler plate template.
00:16:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So you have the first one probably has a fault, not a fault, right?
00:16:56 - mark sweet (3)
it just binary or is there a third? No, there's a third. Okay.
00:17:02 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you, it's one of the three. And then the next one, so the injury would be the most complicated one, right? You'd have to then go through your database that you have, and litify like, Hey, here are all the possible injuries.
00:17:15 - mark sweet (3)
And then you'd have to build like a sort of matrix, which I can totally see with. Hold on. So when I say injuries, it's pulling from the medical workers of that specific client with what they had.
00:17:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Right. So, but you'd say, like, Hey, had an MRI. They had this. had that. So what is the number more based on the treatments than the actual injury? Like, Oh, it was their neck MRI. you build like a matrix and say they had MRI, this, this, this, this. And then maybe, and then the prices or whatever are included. So it's like, if you could dynamically say, Hey, like imagine, filling in a form and you're like, it's, it's not at fault, it's MRI, that, that, that, right, select checkboxes. And then it's whatever, whatever the next one is. So they submit the form, that goes in that then temporarily updates the set of fields. then the prompt go, then it hits the prompt and the prompt set, the prompt is written to say, Hey, you're going to look after it's half fault and you're going look at this and you're going to look at these injuries, then go look at this data set that has the injury pricing or whatever, or you're including that price. You're saying it's MRI 5000, it's this, blah, blah, whatever it is. And then the prompt is just waiting for you to give it those parameters. And then it goes and looks at your ideal demand, let's call it, which there's probably an ideal one, right? then boom, you'll write it and then the quick ideally you would write all this and you'd have a demand that's done well to compare it to. You say, okay, if I feed it this data, does the demand that spit out come out like this? Yes or no?
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3)
you see how to train it, like the ones already being written first, hey, mean, this information, no, here's a better example.
00:19:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's no way you could train that. Then you just start massaging that prompt in the middle.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like what we were having Fuji work on with his reports is feeding the data and the analytical process as much as possible. But then the other thing is the system for sure that should be built in is human approval.
00:19:42 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't just get sent out on and so.
00:19:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, well, and you could human score it at the end to go, now that's of three or the lawyer scores. Somebody, somebody that you trust their scoring.
00:19:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That right there. Mark's score basically for a while, and then train somebody that scores according to your approval. That's the thing for, okay, so going back to the application conversation and just the pace of the technology and the evolution, the innovation that is available right now is leveraged, all of this is AI stuff is leveraged if it's used right, but all of it has to be something that you learn firsthand, everything has to be. For example, okay, so Dan, the foundation of basis really is numbers tell the whole story, so we need to be able to have the numbers. When it comes to online businesses, most of those numbers come through the website, so the analytics. So he's diving into GA4, which is Google Analytics 4, right? It's a whole new beast. We've been using Google Analytics. I've been using it since 2002, probably. I think it was out. Maybe it wasn't that old. Maybe a few years after that. Let's see, 2008, I was getting into split testing. So anyway, we'll say maybe like 2005, people were already starting to use Google Analytics. And now it's an entirely different kind of thing. It's this whole host of a suite, basically, of things that you used to have to get somewhere else. But Google owns all of it. And because it's so new, even the experts are still just kind of figuring out how to use it. So he has a massive leverage opportunity to be an innovator right now, which is a business owner who understands how to tap into Google Analytics. And so he's doing it. He's been studying it for weeks. From an expert who I know personally and I've met and he that's all he's been doing is this this whole time So he's been going growing with it But Dan can't delegate this to anybody right and If he could it would cost it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth it The only one he could delegate to would be another expert. So for you with the marketing with the with the AI but also The business the culture all of these things coalesce into Something very unique for you specifically and subsequently sweet law, which does have its own Unique identity and culture, but I'm just saying The things that interest you If it's innovative and leverage the more you spend time on that and getting real data Talking with Dan. I'm kind of helpful with these things Sometimes he spends more time in it. But anyway, um, there, there's a lot of opportunity to at least figure out how we can shave a little time here and there. So we've been talking about the path to growth is optimization and leverage. This is it. If you can improve the script through analysis data, right, with AI, if you can improve, and not just the intake script, but the attorney's want to script two for certain types of scenarios so that they can be handling things more consistently. So like Lorenz for Mike or the case managers, actually, basically everybody, certain scripts for certain scenarios, they feel like they could be trained better to handle specific types of people and scenarios. Because they know their job that people handling is not what their best at knowing the law and case handling is what their best at people handling is a necessary part of managing the case well so like we've been talking about call control scripts or just I brought up the phrase a few times but when I brought it up to runs sorry hold on and when he brought it up to his team they all want training I need to tell you this by the way it was the last last week conversation but so using AI to kind of help us find scripts if you are listening somehow to all the calls in sweet law and can identify who handles inside the team already the best types of people like if we were able to and that we're not here yet I don't think with the AI but something to keep in mind about like best case scenario best use cases would be okay who handles um specific death cases who handles any type of thing or any type of person and they could label it by the language that's used um and then say okay this person does a really great job of handling this type of person like Mike with distributions. So what Mike does that Lauren said that stand out is Mike doesn't take it personal and he kind of scapegoats the the law firm he's like my hands are tired I can't this is just the rule like I'm I'm not the one deciding that this is what we're gonna get paid this is policy but for whatever reason the way that he says it diffuses the situation and then he can get the full attorney fees more often than other people without people being odd and so that's a skill right but is there a teachable not not necessarily scripts but maybe a logic so is there a verbal cue of some but he says this, respond this way, and the result is this. This kind of analysis, which you'd have to listen to so many calls to be able to do that, but if we could get to the point where I think we can, probably in the next year or two, AI could do that really well, and you could identify, you read the book switch, right? Do you remember the phrasing, bright spots? Okay, so they are the anomalies where everything is bad and then all of sudden you've got something that's just amazing, and a lot of times it was something that already existed, so it was a resource that you already own. I'll give you the example and I'll throw this in for you Dan. So there was this guy, he had to go to some Asian culture, I don't remember where it was, where the children were malnourished, and he had about six weeks in a very minimal budget and had to overhaul it and improve their nutrition. And he was a college, something that was funded through college and so you know he had to succeed with all these limits but what they did is they calmed all the data and they found out that there was one location where the children were actually doing really really well and so they went down there and they observed their daily life and they noticed that the mothers when they were working in the rice fields that they would take the shrimp that they found in the water and added into the kid's rice and so they were getting protein and so the kids were healthier and that actually was available to everybody else in the culture but it wasn't a practice across that that area I don't even remember where it was I wish I did I read it like 10 years ago anyway so that resource was available to everybody but only one person was using it so they didn't need a new budget they just needed to tell people use what's in front of you put it in the rice give it to your kids they'll be better you may boom right so it already existed so my point is that if we can get better data, even more deeper data stuff that we've never even thought about really looking into, because it was a pain in the and Mark doesn't like pain in the is data. I just had this conversation with the other person like I don't want to do that. Anyway, um, friends go figure. Anyway, um, then we can figure out where are the bright spots in sweet loss. Like, is there something that Samantha does on calls that makes her even better? Um, I think that there's going to be more that we can figure out. And if we can figure out how to safely, ethically reliable, reliably get AI into, listen to these calls and give us some kind of info. That would be, we could really improve and up level all of your existing people. with feedback from what's already happening inside this route. I wore myself out talking too much. But anyway, hopefully that was useful. Dan, you're quiet. Are you in a rabbit hole?
00:29:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I'm like sitting here going, I think I could build a demand rider right now with high level. I think because you don't need, you don't. So right now we, for the AI bot that closes people into appointments, we've trained it. So it has this massive prompt that it's always referencing, but the prompt is in a document. So that's the data storage example that I was getting earlier. Here, it's just, I don't know if it's a text file. can't remember. But, and then we let it round. And then we massaged it based on the outcome, we said, oh, don't do that, do this, don't do that. So now I'm like, okay, we just sort of mapped out the parameters. Obviously, it's not exactly right, but it's in the neighborhood. There's not that many. So it's like, okay, you had a form and then you, the form had these elements in it. And then you said, you just have someone fill out that form. Again, it's just all going to be about the prompt. So if I fill out that form and I send it to the prompt, what do I get at the output, right? And that's a very, like, we don't need a production ready, passable, blah, blah. What's the point in doing all that if it doesn't work, right? are around the sizzle. Hey, we're going to go build a business around this sizzle. But... If the stake is no good, I don't care how easily it is. And that's, what are the odds, right? That, I mean, I can tell you right now, I'd be willing to bet a lot that none of these companies have a pre-lit lawyer at the helm saying that's a good demand, right? And let's face facts. What do you need at the end? You need a good demand. What's a good demand? The one that gets you more money than the demand, right? They don't even have a comparative, but they don't know good from bad. It's like, well, I met with the absurdly guys and they were telling me, which we need to talk about them later, they had what might be another Arizona firm backed by P.E. Money that they sold a thousand leads to. But let's say their leads are $250 a piece, which they may or may not be. can't remember their present. So they dropped 250. Yeah, they drop this, this firm, whoever they are, drop $250,000. And then they were like to add sardly. How do we know this is working? Come again. You guys don't know what to do. So then the ads are like, well, you know, you're going to want to look at how many you convert to a retainer, like, what is that blah blah blah. is over the course of like two or three months, and then they pulled the plug and they said, okay, we're going to stop and we're going to evaluate and see what the outcome is. Pardon, your outcome is not coming for about six more months.
00:32:41 - mark sweet (3)
FYI.
00:32:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If you're lucky, if you have lawyers. So clearly, nobody in that project was an actual personal injury lawyer, ever worked in a law firm, any idea how these things go. So they just see, oh, sizzle, can have non lawyer. partners. Let's go. Woohoo. Then they would say I stuff, right? So all you really need to do is just, it's all about the prompt. The prompt will be is the ultimate piece of IP. It's not chat TPT.
00:33:15 - mark sweet (3)
Anyone can access that.
00:33:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's the piece in the middle. And having a good demand as an example choose to say these guys even know what a good demand is. And then your point, that demand might need to be financed by state, right? You can't just have a demand demand demand demand demand, right? They're not all the same yet. That's how they position it. And then they just slap this huge price tag on it.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
None of the sites have pricing on it, which is always a digital way. If you build anything, that's AI related, Dan, and it is prompt related. What I want you to do is build a dummy test scenario that you run through regularly because my experience is that the output is changing. For example, I have a game that I like to play, and I like to get some photographs, and I have a group, whatever. It's my little, it's my little unwind thing. But I noticed that the output of the group was kind of low, so you help people, so you don't have to buy boosters and upgrades to get through things, and I like to do that, whatever. So I started giving stats, and we went from 200 helps a week to 2,000 to 200 helps a week in a matter of like a few weeks, because they gave people stats. But anyway, I use AI to screenshot all of the players and their rankings and their helps, and it did it really well in the beginning, and now I'm having an issue with the same exact prompt and the same exact data, getting it to give me the same kind of report. So what that alerted me to is that I need to have a test prompt and a test result, right? So if I ask you to do this, I expect a specific type of output. If I give you the same exact prompt every single time, I should get something within 99% of the same kind of output. Because if you're building, let's say, a demand writer, and you give it the parameters, and all of a sudden the algorithm in the background changes. And now, or, and this is what I actually think happened, more, what's the word, the law changes, and they just can find what it can do? If the parameters change in the algorithm, if anything changes in the algorithm, then it would change your output. So, but they're not going to tell you that this happened. Even if they tell you there's changes, whatever. or people are going to pay attention to it. So what I think that you should have, if you have anything that's AI based, is a test that says, you know, if I give you this, you output this, it's the same every time. So make sure that you're still getting the same kind of function.
00:36:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah.
00:36:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even on private servers that's still having the same issue. Yeah, because you're hooking it, unless you wrote your own AI, if you're hooking into OpenAI through an API, you're still using their stuff. And if the law has changed, which does happen, legislature changes, know, they can't do, what they can't do, how it can be used ethically, whatever, something can change the way it's able to respond to you, then it may change your output. It may say, well, I ethically can't give you that. And maybe the work around is the way you ask the question. maybe you simply can't get it whatsoever, but either way, if you don't have something to test the quality and go, hey, or maybe you find out that the output hasn't improved with your test, like your dummy test, what you call it? Whatever, prompt. back to checks and balances, if you're using AI, there should be a foundational fundamental, this is my test that you can still do what I've been assuming that you're doing and that you're doing it with the same kind of logic so that you know if the logic has improved or just gotten worse or you know the output has changed. I don't think anybody's thinking about that or building that. I'm sure somebody is, but I haven't heard anybody say it yet, so but we have to take that into account because the outputs do change and there's stuff happening in the programming behind the scenes that they're not going to be like, hey, just you know, you know this.
00:38:00 - mark sweet (3)
One of other hard parts of what we do is the medical side of it. And what I mean by that is we've got to bring all these medical workers together and, um, prelet side, we can redact things that are bad, um, and put it in a way that puts our client in less payroll. Like, I don't know how to train a bot to be able to do that.
00:38:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can. I'm sure there's ways of knowing you know, it's not hard. It's fronting. Okay. I could help you with that.
00:38:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like you can. Turn to do what?
00:38:31 - mark sweet (3)
So we'll have, let's say, hospital records, right? We really just want to only provide the best things. I don't want to be hard to where it says like they're on Matt, um, bad for us. And in pre litigation, we don't have to necessarily share all the records. Okay. pre litigation, we don't. And so a large part of why attorneys are doing the demands in my office, because I won't use records to pull out the bad stuff to hide it.
00:38:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
War games screenshot in my head. play a game. But the reason is though, because chat GPT does have some rules about what it can do ethically, but if you put in the parameter, let's play a game, we're going to role play. This is your role. Your role is to share this information, but to make sure that we never insinuate or allude to drug usage or this or this or this or whatever. You lose the game if you reveal x, y, z, whatever, and that logic can work.
00:39:34 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:39:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, again, it's going to be a matter of like having a stop word sort of library, I can't the word, that, you know, you can start it right off the gate, right, heroin, meth, right, like there's something you're going get, but then you're going to miss one, right? But as long as you can then update that. database or however that record exists, then you'll get to it, right? So it's the path to getting to the right version is just iterative beta testing with yourself, right? So you turn, like how many cases do you settle a month?
00:40:21 - mark sweet (3)
don't even know, I don't pay attention to number.
00:40:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so you have 80 examples a month, right? you actually use these demands, you could run 80 demands through this thing, and it's going to learn pretty quick, right? It should learn around, I would say 300, you get about 300 in there, and you should have a statistically significant outcome. Now, it's just a matter of doing, right? You do it and look at it and go, yeah, that's good, that's bad, this part's right, this part's wrong. But it's going to learn through actual real world data, god forbid.
00:41:01 - mark sweet (3)
Like you said a rating and like this one's a two out of ten. This one's an eight out of ten. So that way.
00:41:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep. Yep Yeah, exactly and it's you grade it and then give it feedback what was wrong. This is what was wrong Yeah, this is like I talked to Salco about this months ago once once We got through it. was like, oh wait, this could be done. like it can be done. It just you have to do it Yeah, right. I'm I'm sure if you set up one of these services and then run a demand through what comes out You're gonna be like, this is not great And they'll go oh, we're working on it.
00:41:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're working on it.
00:41:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
How are you working on it?
00:41:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, that's literally my concern is this just gonna be what they have which is the same as just a template pulled together, right? my own thing then someone else's right because you need to us Then with their every situation where we can make it like a one butt click from ourselves for us or no
00:42:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
probably, but that's like the next level, right? Then you have to go right, sales course app version, but the parts that you would you carry over would be the prompt, right? Then you just have to say, Oh, this, this front end. Let's say the front end is just always a form. Oh, this front end form needs to be a whatever their language is called. I forgot what it's going, but it needs to be a blah, blah, form, but then it's still going to go hit any API for charge, even tea, and then it's going to output it inside of the sales force app. And then probably turn into a PDF or whatever.
00:42:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And just a reminder, an encouragement, although I think you get excited enough about the stuff that you don't need it, but the habit that we have of iterations and also just so So you start building something knowing it's not the end product. It's. going to change, you're going to have to do some rework, but it's not really rework because it's iterative, because it's going to have been improved, because you will have learned something that it's then a compounding effect of what you started with and a little bit of a tweak, but in terms of like building something and then hooking it into Salesforce, when you try to have a conversation with somebody ambiguously, like there's no nothing really specific and they're just trying to imagine what that looks like, you're dealing with the limitations of their brain, whereas if you have something that already exists, now you're talking to a coder who deals with API, plus who's familiar with Salesforce and what the options are and whatever, then it becomes much easier conversation because you have a foundation to start with. So if you're willing to put the elbow prison and spend some time trying to figure out a base level framework and get it. started what happens is the same thing that happens every time we've created any type of framework around data or systems or whatever is that you look at it and you're like oh I didn't think about this I didn't think about this and it is a revelatory revelatory process that makes everything else easier but usually what happens is people just think it think it think it think it think I'd like to think the solution you can't you create the solution then the real solution presents itself so you're in the position now of just I mean whether it be something that you use to massively leverage sweet law and I say massively but let's think about it on an energy level and also just kind of alleviating what's tedious or minutia for you and for your people when you have the ability to conserve conserve that energy then all that energy gets to put into higher leverage activity so in and of itself Oh, that is a great play, but then if you create a system that is now kind of proprietary system that you can go sell and monetize, but also not just, you know, coldly because you can go make money, but you also go to get to help your friends use a system. And then you find all of the, you know, related type of activities that it can be used for different types of markets, the dog food like there's. Just using AI to analyze and figure out things. I mean, there's, there's so many plays to it if you're willing to sit there and think and work out the solutions like as much time as Dan is spent in high level. And as much time as you spent just researching and marketing and having all these conversations with different people you put all of that together and. Pretty awesome.
00:45:50 - mark sweet (3)
think. Yeah, no, Dan's super anonymous me almost thought this is all, but if we can actually build the stake behind this is all then we've got something.
00:46:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And even if you only use it for yourself, I have many tools that I've built just for me. I enjoy them daily.
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
But as you like to say, Dan, what are the hardest people to sell?
00:46:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, would be, you know, the best products are the ones that solve your own problem, right? And it's not just you know, it's not just your problem, right? And then then you also have tied to that, the whole story brand aspect of, oh, yeah, no, you know, it's trite to say, build for Laurie's bio borders. But in this scenario, it's not, it's not trite. mean, it's, I don't know if that gets used a lot actually in this space, to be honest, but you know, we get built from, built from marketers by marketers, but it's, it's true. And it's like, you know, you could, then you can go into this whole story brand aspect of it. And also results before and after, before. before demand rider, after demand rider, right? Whether it's saving time, it's an increase, like Salco's convinced that you can increase your bottom line through ruptured, like really dialing in the demands.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can increase my bottom line.
00:47:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
that's true, if that's true, let's say that does happen, you're also going to free up time for lawyers, which may or may not have a result, but it's quantifiable, right? These are the these are the cornifiable outcomes of this thing.
00:47:40 - mark sweet (3)
So, we just kind of need to pick A-Link to start with, I guess, for lack of a better term, because there's just so many options for where to go, but demands make the most sense.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Organizers get them processed, analyze, start there. So, first, it would be getting files that could be fed,
00:48:00 - mark sweet (3)
to AI first securely there is one other thing that I think actually AI can do very very well and it's already somewhat in our system which is pulling by insurance companies and by adjusting their settlements and what total damages are produced damages are to see who we do better with and who we don't do as well with and see if there's anything between doctors we use and don't use yeah I don't have enough data for everything everything but at least we could tell by insurance company and get it started and it's just feeding more data as things go yeah like State Farm I think that now they are very bad State Farm to State Farm things and they're on there we're going to let you get lot of stuff because we're spending too much money which they go every like three to five years between this yeah that was the interest that uh that thing that Josh showed us is doctor thing and then how I when I when he pulled that up I was like wait a second
00:49:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like he, he's like, oh, you can use this to find doctors, which I thought was interesting, but then he was also saying that it did that. It should, it allowed you to then look at your outcome per doctor. So you could be like, you know what, this doctor doesn't get as good as this doctor. But then you could go back to that tool and be like, I need a new pain management dude in this area. And then all of a sudden, here's the 20 guys in that area.
00:49:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know if anybody remembers somebody was asking about tracking doctors and creating his spreadsheet for that, just so we can get that data. Bring any bells at all. Oh, yeah.
00:49:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So his thing, his thing does it. I also thought it was interesting. Did you catch this mark? was like, hey, wait, what? So he basically was like saying that your firm's bigger than theirs, right?
00:49:55 - mark sweet (3)
That was the bye I was getting yet.
00:49:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Didn't he also say that they refer out three?
00:50:00 - mark sweet (3)
hundred cases a month.
00:50:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I was like, wait, what?
00:50:03 - mark sweet (3)
Yes. Now, how many hours, how many are actually like retained or referred out? think are different numbers.
00:50:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, yeah, me too. This was the conversation I had with the ads, certainly guys. Yeah. So oh, yeah, back to that. They gave me all the data on this. We'll just say it was the new Arizona firm. They converted 14% of those leagues. But that's with their version of I'm sure those guys were just retainers, right? They're gold. metric is retainers. It's like, no, the metric is cases. They are different.
00:50:42 - mark sweet (3)
No, I could believe if your criteria is crap, then mine, right? have a great tier. I can believe 14% fairly is because we're at what percent would have certainly like five?
00:50:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's everyone's five.
00:50:57 - mark sweet (3)
Right? Right?
00:50:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's like that number comes up all
00:51:00 - mark sweet (3)
time. I don't know how to refer it out as how many 10 10 percent.
00:51:06 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:51:07 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah.
00:51:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So we need to get so we need to get that in place which we talked about before like there's referred out and then we need we need to differentiate with out for referral and then as been referred out because right now it seems like things are referred out but if you pointed out on those three or four that I sent you you're like I don't think anyone's going to take those however the system says refer it out so I'm like we need to change that.
00:51:34 - mark sweet (3)
Oh yeah absolutely no it's still referred out because again we're going find anything from even from the jobs 50 percent if one out of you know 10 they get some money on but still one more that I wouldn't have any money in.
00:51:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well yeah the quick math we did a couple of weeks ago was it's five grand so it's like okay five grand you know nothing especially if it's just a phone call but if you were to go in right now and say refer it out times 5,000, that would be a false number. It's not really that. So, I actually talked to Isaac about that. He's going through the Salesforce course. He's learning some things.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, speaking of Josh, what does he have for us in reports right now? You were saying that he could do the...
00:52:20 - mark sweet (3)
We had a really cool meeting that you're going to like, but he needs a little time to put it together.
00:52:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I heard about it. I'm really upset I didn't get to be there.
00:52:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Listen, it was I don't meet with him ever. So super, he was like, can we do it Thursday? I was like, uh, okay. But normally it's all email. It's not face to face. Or zoom or anything. And it's actually normally it's email through Stacy.
00:52:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't even email him. No recording.
00:52:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't get to hear all the smart stuff. You don't.
00:52:56 - mark sweet (3)
I'm sorry. I like the end result of it.
00:52:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's a good part.
00:53:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like the conversations because then my brain goes, whoa, this is good.
00:53:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, fine. He knows this for sure.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but here's the thing. He's the guy who has access to all the data I have been asking for for years.
00:53:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Some of it.
00:53:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:53:19 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For sure.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Either way, it's just I decided to see.
00:53:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, you have to his thing builds it. So that data doesn't really exist with his add on. It can. So it's like he, he has two apps that he, I guess, sells. don't know. He didn't actually get it. He did not try to sell us on them at all, which was also funny. He just showed to show them to us and he's like, nerding out on them. I like, yeah, but it's kind of interesting. I suppose we could ask him how much the app is.
00:53:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It might be it. Could you do that and ask him to like. I'm gonna tape a demo and let's just hope that he just gets really geeky in there.
00:54:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he will.
00:54:06 - mark sweet (3)
thinking about this though.
00:54:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Let's see. Oh, yeah.
00:54:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, will you ask for that?
00:54:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm already doing it.
00:54:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay. This is gonna be fun. See that and somebody who is excited to go create it and get it for us. I mean, you guys, that's a golden kiss right there. Golden Goose. Okay. Um, uh, down you said you needed to talk about the answer to the guys, but was that what you just talked about? Also, yay for record month.
00:54:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's good. I was not outrageous. So what was not outrageous? Or spend like we didn't over spend to try to get to that number.
00:54:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you spend?
00:54:58 - mark sweet (3)
I don't have the final number. Because they're still adding stuff into the system. So like the very, very rough number. Was. About 420 case spent.
00:55:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And.
00:55:23 - mark sweet (3)
The other week or so we should have the final final numbers, but it looks like it should be around that. Numbers are going to go down and it'll just go up. So it might be, you know, instead of 4,100, 4,250, which is still a lot better than where we were.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, would you divide that by incident or people incident. Okay. Okay.
00:55:49 - mark sweet (3)
If I'm trying to sell or from trying to like position myself, I do it obviously by people because it looks better and how 99% of firms look at things. I just don't look at that way from the market. Because again, it's one call, it's not three different calls, right?
00:56:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:56:08 - mark sweet (3)
Um, and they also include their drops and subouts and then try to pull those out as well. Because if we kept those numbers, if we look by person and by drops of outs, then we're at 126, that brings the number down to, you know, 33, which is a significant difference from 4,100.
00:56:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's, I mean, that's really good. Yes. And your subout rate, what we haven't done, which I want to do when we're starting to track it, is just kind of figure out what that percentage is, 8% roughly, right now. But I'm tracking it over time.
00:57:01 - mark sweet (3)
I mean, in this case, it was just, there was one set out where someone signed with three firms in total. Um, I mean, the drops, I put the reasons why all of them in total sense. Um, you know, one, maybe we could have done a better job of the upfront just to try to keep them with their response. If everything else was, you know, a pretty good reason, um, you know, stopping right after a setup. So we need to figure out, is there something better once they sign an agreement to get them to feel better with us? And both those were HQ intakes. So I need to see what we can do to shore that up. I don't know if the HQ intakes do it in Vegas. The guy who runs it's about four, uh, five foot two.
00:57:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not so bad. Hey, that's a good height.
00:57:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
For a guy. Mm hmm.
00:57:51 - mark sweet (3)
who? ball guy with mustache.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Portuguese girl.
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. Okay. Um, because you're coping. Myers is trying to buy all their leads. California, because they have a lead generation business goes with it. They're doing that nationwide, but they're having issues and having to like fire some clients. They like to work with us because we're relatively easy to work with and we get in the answer to the phone. We actually follow up. So. I'm trying to steer away from them saying everything Jacoby is obviously one more. Their cost is 3,500 per retainer. including their cost.
00:58:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's not. It's not late.
00:58:27 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:58:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So their lead to they close it themselves. Correct. Oh. Have you seen what? Well, you've gotten it, but it's not. You've already seen what they signed. Right. So what percentage.
00:58:45 - mark sweet (3)
And I see you respond to them.
00:58:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:58:48 - mark sweet (3)
It doesn't seem very. I say 10% we say, what did you sign this?
00:58:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Exactly. So I was going to say probably still about 10% right. So they're not. Cucouville as far as signing the wrong stuff.
00:59:05 - mark sweet (3)
Now, can I get the price point? may make sense, but I don't know.
00:59:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, it's going to. Yeah, let's say, yeah, if it puts it up at 4,500, remember, um, could score work.
00:59:18 - mark sweet (3)
Look, in special outcomes.
00:59:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Analyzing as a vendor.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so just will just will have the per vendor. That's what I was going to ask.
00:59:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, we're doing per vendor per state, and then we're checking the ROA all the way through to see what our ROI is on each source.
00:59:41 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:43 - mark sweet (3)
But then hopefully we also add on per attorney. So we'll see which attorneys doing what.
00:59:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, understand you guys all like want growth and they don't get excited about anything and really celebrate the win. That's a big celebration.
00:59:58 - mark sweet (3)
And then you should celebrate with your whole team and tell them. They're reading large bonuses this month so i'm already um super thrilled about spending more money.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean that's not the only way to celebrate you can just oh i need to schedule another like follow-up meeting with you too. I want to do that.
01:00:16 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah almost sixty two thousand dollars this past month on bonuses which is a lot.
01:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a lot um yeah but you don't have to just use money to thank people.
01:00:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah people like money.
01:00:32 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They do like money but they also like praise.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do in LA. They also like praise and knowing especially yours.
01:00:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah they also like money.
01:00:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh whatever. Okay um so we spend a lot of time talking about the AI stuff just one other Just want to start getting up over one because it's going to take a lot of time to get it right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet (3)
Like it's not this is not okay. By next week we got a process. That'd be cool but. that's not yeah likely um but in every case that we get the policy limit on meaning we get the most amount um circling those to feed because we always want to give chat sheet see the best data although guess we can say hey oh void writing demands like this as well yes you so you want to a high low yeah yeah for sure and it's worth all the effort to organize that data to feed it correctly and then give it the parameters and really have um measure the output based off of the prompt there's there's a lot of leg work to do but then once you do it it goes really fast so um i mean i think that's really it uh is there anything else that we should discuss rather um then try to start any new conversations right now that was a good conversation and especially because
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're leverage and optimization, which is really the overarching, you know, target that we have the most out of the least.
01:02:08 - mark sweet (3)
So we can go with Dan, you know, there's more money to be made for Dan and for me, for the separate side projects that are not just the law for themselves. And I want to make Dan and myself lots of extra money.
01:02:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, you know, there you go.
01:02:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll just watch.
01:02:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, look, this is the doctor run, right?
01:02:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doctor notes like I'm down for it. I got lots of time to work.
01:02:32 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, I want to hire a teen and make her my money too. She's not.
01:02:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, okay. So is there anything that's pressing anything that we should know or just to bring that for an agenda for next week? On either side.
01:02:54 - mark sweet (3)
And this month, I'll be waved into Colorado and to We don't have anybody in Colorado to do it. We have both Fuji and agape.
01:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I'm an attorney.
01:03:11 - mark sweet (3)
Like you're the only one that we able to do Colorado. Yeah, the same way we do like Washington right now.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just saying cuz like somebody's already in New Mexico, but not you.
01:03:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I'm asking Colorado is open for the Colorado's mark and mark AI.
01:03:26 - mark sweet (3)
Here we go. Yeah, no Colorado is we're trying to. haven't done anything with it yet. Um, although thing of it, the dude who was selling like coaching, he did like a really crappy job with Andy Stickel on the other dude. I don't remember who that is. Anyway, they connected with the guy in Colorado who just does a bunch of billboards, but doesn't want to actually work, and wants to spend all his time in Italy. So, yeah, maybe they'll be in part of connection there, but I don't know.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, anything else?
01:04:00 - mark sweet (3)
Talk to Tom and the CAMG people about potentially doing boards into Mexico because that may not be the worst place to start and start getting like our message a little bit clearer and our feet under us to some level. That's just one thing we really haven't done much of any on is, you know, traditional.
01:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I would love to see the valiant breakdown by state.
01:04:31 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, it was actually kind of interesting. No Washington, despite generating a decent number of Washington leads in no California.
01:04:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how much of New Mexico was him.
01:04:49 - mark sweet (3)
I'll tell you right now because he had asked him the same thing and to do the breakdown form. So that was for Missouri, five New Mexico for Washington. Sorry, no Arizona, that was not Washington, Arizona, that was weird.
01:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or Missouri, what?
01:05:10 - mark sweet (3)
Or Missouri, five New Mexico, Washington. But he generated a decent number of Arizona leads, just not an abandoned anything.
01:05:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where do the rest of the New Mexico ones come from?
01:05:26 - mark sweet (3)
Three came from Quantify. One came from Felipe, one came from Monkey, five from Valiant, three from Walker.
01:05:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was just asking because for the longest time in Mexico was averaging like two, and then we jumped up all of a sudden, just a few months ago to six, and now we've got thirteen. I mean, those retainers, that that trajectory is impressive.
01:05:56 - mark sweet (3)
It's quantifying Valiant, those are the two that really made the difference.
01:06:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
before quantifies Ben and quite frankly pretty good find thanks for mustache guy yeah like I said he never know so we're like him sort mustache guy yeah that's a case HQ but who found them case HQ on case HQ no case HQ came from case connect guys yeah and then case HQ referred quantified and who did case connection guys come from me that was the pedigree before it was me yes okay okay it was me for being on Facebook sort of case Nick was an absolute monetary failure for us that's okay they saw
01:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you have to look at the pedigree, you have to look at the little chart there, it matters, cause and effects, everything.
01:07:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, that is good point, right? It's like, some, right, it's not a fail, it wasn't a, it was a lesson, right? wasn't a failure in one respect, but then it's like led to this and led to this.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It had a return, even if the return was indirect.
01:07:25 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, and then other people won't do it, right? That's like, that's what the ads are dealing with right now. All these firms they call, they're like, please stop calling me.
01:07:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, yeah, I'll bet. Also, this goes into the practice, which we intentionally and purposely have, which is exploring all the vendors. right. Yeah, exactly. that they're going to be crap and knowing that even if they are crap, sometimes there's a tangent that is valuable to us and, but look at, I mean, record number, When we started your low 30s, mid 30s, and now you're here, and one of the practices is exploring all the vendors, having all the conversations, and it is tedious, and it is risky, and some of them don't pan out. But because of the relationships in those conversations, and the secondary and tertiary conversations that happen as a result of the first one, look at where you're at now, all these different sources, just the change in power and who's bringing what across the state, it's just, I just want to pay attention to the practices and the value of that, because it's important.
01:08:43 - mark sweet (3)
So monkeys back to where it shouldn't be, because they did concerned over last month, obviously, because the numbers didn't make sense.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I feel like you leave You you manage the vendors better. I feel like you were a little bit more reactive before you didn't know your numbers, you weren't on top of them and you were hesitant to want to have conversations with them. I think you felt like they had a little bit more power over you than the other way around the dynamic has shifted and all of that has happened mostly. Here's the thing. The other thing about data that people don't really notice is that it creates a level of confidence in you know what you know. And so you do what you do even better, and that adds to more confidence and it's a compounding effect too but when you negotiate with people confidently their outcome is very different. So, anyway, all of that just takes into account. So, just wanted to point it out.
01:09:52 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, I just got to repeat it and beat it. think we're tenors out for next month already so that's good.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good September. I can.
01:10:00 - mark sweet (3)
That's all right. Yeah. Well, I dropped for it. That's fine. So we'll repeat it again, which is good. And then starting soon, have Yuri. He's a lot of Thark joining us. So he's a Ukrainian Lot Thark dude and he's going to be taking the bar in February.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And where's he going to fit?
01:10:23 - mark sweet (3)
So when he starts, we just have him do demands because I think it's going to start getting too busy. can do more as a demands. A lot of us quit with his to help Lorenz. He has a very large support system, but we're trying to see if can create another Patrick for lack of a better term where hey, this is kind of good. And you know, short term rental, I guess is the best way to think about it. You get a chance to see the lawyer be it be like in baseball, right? like, oh, it's a mid season pick up, but then like they're down the end of the season. We like to do not like anything. And so if he's a great film another Patrick, he's not great. We'll just say, hey, know, our perfect time done.
01:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. I love that.
01:11:02 - mark sweet (3)
I love that as a problem process to build them up. this is a long term commitment, but but it's not with no without anything because he's doing some work.
01:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it's the and also that's easier than going out and just trying to hire anybody because that doesn't go well.
01:11:23 - mark sweet (3)
We're having much more difficult time with it. So it makes more sense to build these people internally or I'll do both quite frankly, where we can find them. We just have to keep an eye on our payroll because that's a lot.
01:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is the guy who just like keeps throwing out bonus and left and right.
01:11:40 - mark sweet (3)
That's Mary more than me, but yeah.
01:11:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay. Well, Mary.
01:11:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think we need to start having some other conversations.
01:11:49 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Mary's nickname is money fairy.
01:11:51 - mark sweet (3)
Maybe you didn't know this. Look, we started. That's what I was going to say. You know, if the teams have their goals. to help them do more than push them and do more. So, you know, hey, and those are high numbers. think maybe.
01:12:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But here's the question. Here's the real question. Are these numbers a result of that or not? Because you're for sure related. But right.
01:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
to what degree?
01:12:26 - mark sweet (3)
Right. I think what's going to be more on the money in than on the settlements themselves because the teams while they do have some controller getting, you know, records and whatnot. I'm sure they feel more like the attorneys are responsible for that. On the money in, you know, maybe something like the teams like the case manager is sitting around like, how close are we, how close are we to see what else they can push to try to get that extra money in.
01:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing though. It's the amount that will make the biggest impact to you that actually almost makes the least impact to them. So psychologically. If there is a bonus for a thing, it's not necessarily that that bonus has to be a certain number. It just has to be there There's a potential that you're overpaying. So like on the line item for how you can earn the money Taking that back not necessarily you can't take anything back. Anyway, this is a whole big long conversation But my point is is that a lot of times a five dollar Not talking about your attorney your your your attorneys your team But it's somebody just getting an unexpected or an earned extra a small amount Versus a large amount that the happiness level is almost equal. They're obviously our gaps, right? But my point is that To get the lift that you need you probably don't have to give the lifts that you're giving so There is some math to be figured out there, but again you have an existing team Zisting expectations pulling back and then you have have to look at what's available in the market. There's a lot of numbers to crunch.
01:14:04 - mark sweet (3)
And that's probably what it comes to the market, where we can do these interviews, what people want, is more than what we're paying our current people for lower quality.
01:14:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:14:14 - mark sweet (3)
So this is the way to bridge that gap to some level.
01:14:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's entirely possible that it's a very, very good system. And so then the other way to leverage your money is to be able to use things like the AI to have them doing less of the tedious stuff. So they're doing more of the money-making activities. So with the same amount of staff, you're getting more money. You're also paying more bonuses. But that still should be maybe it's not a higher percentage of profit margins, but an overall higher bottom line. Then you're still winning the game.
01:14:51 - mark sweet (3)
So I think that's issue for me. is that I wanted an achievable because I hated, hated, hated working for people where the goal is just not realistic.
01:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You feel like you're being set up to fail?
01:15:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. But I think it may actually be a little low because I shouldn't be breaking even every month if they hit their goal.
01:15:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Like that's not right.
01:15:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Exactly. So what kind of How can we visually see this data of what comes in and I have to think about, you know, what I would want to see, but all the different types of bonuses, what all the goals are, who hits them, how they hit them, what it costs you, aside from the bonuses is, you know, the working net revenue up until payroll and bonuses so that we can see that correlation and and look at the performance over time.
01:16:03 - mark sweet (3)
I can't, I'm kind of fried right now, but the most person they got and go through, but you know, again, these are good problems to have right in their goals and in their expectations.
01:16:13 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's definitely not a bad thing. Oh, I got something. I talked to your boy, Salco. I forget when, but I forget when, but because I didn't answer the phone for a couple days, because I was doing a bunch of with my parents, but uh, so he was saying, and I thought this was interesting because I was like, okay, yeah, I never thought about that. He was saying how he just settled a dog bite through you or whatever, in your, in your firm, I think, for like 75 grand. He's like, yeah, just settled a dog bite for 75 grand. And I was like, okay. And he's like, can any of these vendors generate dog bite leads? And I was like, I don't know, like I never, I've never done it. I've never asked them. I've also never seen it. So I, when I I was talking to Ed, certainly, on my bi-weekly call that I have with them, for whatever reason. I brought it up with them, and the guy was like, really? I go, And he goes, I've never seen anybody do that. go, neither have I. So then he starts researching. He goes, dude, there's nine million dog mike. And he just starts rattling off all the data. And I go, And he's like, why doesn't anybody do this? go, I don't know. I go because lawyers, copy lawyers, copy lawyers. And I go, do you think you could generate them? He goes, yeah. And so when I was talking to South, I go, what's the criteria? And he goes, I mean, you know, that route lost some . And what I heard was, did you get bit a dog? Do you know who the homeowner is? Did you get medical assistance? Medical treatment. That's it. That's it. That's a lead. So I was like, yeah, that would be a lead. Oh, okay. That's a simple form, right? They just fill that out. So then it just becomes a math problem. What's the cost per lead? So if you say, cost per unit is x, convergent is five, right? We always know it's five from internet, basically. Then, and then average case value, you might not have enough data for that. But I go, okay, that's interesting. Like you could do that, but now you're talking about diversifying your case load, right? So everyone's going out to car accidents. You add this into the mix. got it. Now, hold on. You got car accidents and dog bites. Then you're also adding into the mix. Well, now they've had a lawyer with suite law. And when they get, when they get in a car accident, they're going to call a suite. Yep, and the referrals. So now all of sudden you're adding new nodes to your network. I was like, okay, that's interesting. And then it's a different demand, right? So it's like, okay, do you have a good dog bite demand? Sounds like Salko maybe had a good one. have no idea. But I was like, okay, that's interesting. And these guys were like, I can't find one. ad for this. That's it. I can't explain it to you, but I've never done it. Doesn't mean you should.
01:19:07 - mark sweet (3)
One really big difference between a couple between dog biting car accident.
01:19:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:19:13 - mark sweet (3)
The drop rate is massively higher on dog bite because a lot of people don't have insurance.
01:19:21 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Exactly. So the qualifier, so the 5% might be too in actuality, right?
01:19:29 - mark sweet (3)
So if you if you bake it in a 50% drop rate, you get into the case because that's what I'm saying. So your drop rate is 40% plus.
01:19:38 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So if you model it at 50, can you even model it out, right? So if you say, okay, going to get, you're going to get, it's $250 a lead, you're going to convert five, and then, and then half of those are going to drop. They probably going to be cheaper, right? Yeah. So I was like, all right. And so the ads certainly guys are looking at it. They're like, wait. this is a thing. I go, it is a thing. I just don't know if it's a thing that works. And they're like, all right, this is interesting.
01:20:10 - mark sweet (3)
And of course, for them, talk about you get decent money on, especially when you talk about minor children getting bit, like we've gotten.
01:20:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's the other thing, it's mostly children that get bit just to do sports a lot. No, according to the stats, I don't know if it's truly true.
01:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have a little girl that lives up the street. She got mauled so bad. She doesn't have hair anymore because they she got attacked by two governments and they they chewed up her scout like she shouldn't be alive. She had multiple surgeries.
01:20:43 - mark sweet (3)
It was right. And so if there's insurance on the homeowner, that's, you know, $500 million case.
01:20:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yep.
01:20:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
01:20:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
They got nothing. So those get so you're not totally against this idea, then?
01:20:57 - mark sweet (3)
I'm not totally against the idea because be significantly cheaper for a commitment.
01:21:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would imagine.
01:21:04 - mark sweet (3)
So yeah, exactly. But I'm not against the idea because the criteria is, did you get that yes, and then get scarring photos, basically, would like show me the bite because you've got people that it's like, you know, a scratch, like it's what I got. Oh, there you go.
01:21:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:21:18 - mark sweet (3)
But dog bites, especially California, it's there's no one bike for you. think Arizona law is a little different.
01:21:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you just say one bite free?
01:21:27 - mark sweet (3)
So Arizona kind of has that role, actually.
01:21:29 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You're kidding. You had to have to be a second offense, like second strike.
01:21:35 - mark sweet (3)
Unless, you know, a dog with dangerous propensity. Yeah. wow.
01:21:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And they were like, we could do California. OK, that would actually be the perfect and biggest population, all that good stuff, man.
01:21:49 - mark sweet (3)
Because you got some plastic assertions and stuff like that.
01:21:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So California would definitely be.
01:21:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. yeah.
01:21:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
01:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah. Well, I think the other thing is the system, whatever system. some you create like a could do you have access to or would a private investigator or if you hire them have access to like if you get they say yes I know the homeowner this is where they live this is their information where they could go say we know that they have insurance is it a record that a specific entity would have access to no you can hire a investigation companies it just but they're not the best in that regard I mean you send letters the worst case you file lawsuit and discover you find out pretty quickly and you just learn they have nothing and it's kind of a whatever but so if you wrote it all up it's basically here's the boxes this is what has to happen this is this is how long this would take this is what this process would look like so that and then do a rough forecasted like if we were able to get leads at this cost the percentage that have insurance, don't have insurance, the estimated value like I just did a quick search and it says 4.5 million people have been a Forbes report for last year, per year, 800,000 only must seek medical attention of those. Do they know, you know, how much is that is just little stitches or go away? There's nothing like there's so much data to go get and then plug in those numbers and then how much does it take? But even if it added, you know, $50,000,,000 to your gross revenue, that revenue, whatever, all those numbers, you could spend a day or two doing the research and find out if it's even viable, but if it's viable and you've got...
01:23:45 - mark sweet (3)
It's It's viable. Generally, also need to try to target more affluent areas.
01:23:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You don't want to target like combat. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:23:54 - mark sweet (3)
That's the big difference for the lead generation.
01:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They usually just do state wide and if you live or die by it's an area.
01:24:00 - mark sweet (3)
is where you just, you know, damn well, they don't have anything.
01:24:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:24:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you're not targeting Compton. I got you're in Compton.
01:24:07 - mark sweet (3)
You're going to target more like Vermont.
01:24:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, okay. Um, else that needs to be talked about this week or tabled for brought up for next week to talk about?
01:24:23 - mark sweet (3)
You know, I mean, I buy things definitely in Avenue. Um, because it's easy to train. like, did you get bit by dog? Yes. Okay. You theoretically have a case like it's not.
01:24:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's also it's another way that you're using your existing resources. So it's getting more out of what you have. And that is leverage. Yeah. That's what we want more of that. Okay.
01:24:46 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. That's a back then.
01:24:55 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But yeah. Oh, yeah.
01:24:57 - mark sweet (3)
I know. Yeah. That's coming. Yeah. Just as a quick heads up. that's one word for it.
01:25:05 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but yeah, he died when, like today. Yeah. Yeah. That's what him and I were talking about that. He's like, he was like, I don't understand like what he thinks is going on. Like he's kept saying his dad thinks he's going to be doing this and doing that. I was like, dude, nobody, nobody, like, we're all on the same path. We're all on a path to the end. Of course, we're not sitting there going hope it ends.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My mom is.
01:25:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, is true. And they and they accelerate that for them.
01:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
01:25:47 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, not recommended.
01:25:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not recommended. They're miserable. And they spread them as a read.
01:25:54 - mark sweet (3)
But you had something. All right. We're situation.
01:25:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, for sure.
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right guys, till next week.

Yeah, I totally just I was like, I'm just gonna turn up Bluetooth. I hit the right one. I meant to hit because I think when I'm in the office it bites between data and Wi-Fi.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, I hate what that happens.
00:01:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then but I think that ruins the connection somehow. Same thing when you're outside when I'm outside my house and it's connecting to both, I'm like, I think I killed a Wi-Fi.
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just and I and in my driveway I have to do that every single time. The back of my house is really good but that's because the router is much closer to it.
00:01:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. I'm just like, I will turn you up and the struggle will stop now. Mark hired me to work with China. What?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Mark hired me.
00:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Left field? Yes. Well, it's probably kind of because his way of helping me, but getting something out of it too. So, but she, the business that she's working in is she's not there just as an employee. It's she gets a percentage of it. So, I mean, without crossing boundaries too much and talking about it. So, that, yeah, that. So, I'll start that next week.
00:02:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Nice. And this, what do you, what, she's working at this new job?
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I don't, I don't. Yeah. So, um, he, she's like, I don't know what he's like, you need a business coach because she basically has enough autonomy in what she's doing and has income potential besides just doing the job, right? So, their strategy involved and his introduction. in between the two of us is Tina will help you reach your goals even when you didn't know you had. That's very nice. And then listening to her, she just was stressed out, like I don't know anything and I'm like well let me break it down for you like this. I'll ask you all the questions and figure out how to make things less stressful and it will be all about you because she was like Mark has all these ideas and big and he's just go go go go and sometimes he comes down but mostly he's just got these big things and she's like I just... again just yeah but that's that's a for it's it's a first but also it was interesting because the new guy that he referred me to he's like my wife needs you i'm like i don't know that just makes me feel happy it's different it's very different i'm pretty sure it's very different not a normal stuff right totally but i've never been normal so there's that and i work with not normal so hey not normal right exactly um i yeah i'm really interested now i want to ask about um the what you call it the the plane like deal that he got going oh i don't really know the deep other than it's done i mean like the tax thing like i'm just fascinated with oh that was that was yeah yeah that was like this thing very deep deep into the trump that thing i vaguely recall
00:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Something about it, but you know obviously that's for a very and I remember you know people complaining about it's rich people So yeah, he leveraged that and It's a thing I know obviously it's only a thing probably for I think being out expired is pretty soon I was gonna say But once you're in you're in And then so who bought a jet Just because it almost sounded like doing it with somebody else This this is the part I don't remember and then Selco explained it to me. He's like no dude. He bought the jet and then places the jet with the company that rents the jet out Something like that, and then And then you You it's like it's sort of like the weird Those you're gonna live in if you're gonna do this if you're gonna live in Puerto Rico You have to be there six months of the year The rule for this thing is like you have to use the jail X amount of times per year Every year for the first five years for something like that And but the numbers very long. It's like you have to use it five times That's interesting and then it cat it cash flows positive cash flows 12 grand a month to mark How I mean nobody can be mad about that nope That's crazy. Well, he's playing all these big boy games now like dang dude, right?
00:06:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's Wow, Marcus just
00:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Conan leaps and bounds in all kinds of ways.
00:07:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's pretty amazing. Also, very much a reminder to not judge books by their E.R. covers. Uh, so, I mean, between that and like him hiring me for Chona, and then giving me Fuji, and then letting me work with his clients, like he is far and wide, just been amazing. And he's here because of you. So, I'm thinking I need to send another little gift basket, but I think that it should be something Denise gets part of, because she's the other D and D and D co. And she's losing her babies and making her happy makes you happy. So, what kind of thing could I do for Denise? Like what, like chocolate or bath bombs or something? Can I send a thank you gift to both of you?
00:08:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. I'll let you know.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. You're so quiet.
00:08:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Again, Ariel. Really?
00:08:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:08:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
up the volume.
00:08:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I think part of it is your dynamic too, though, because like when you are part of it, part of it.
00:08:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. So you'll give me some ideas sometimes. Cool. Because especially with able and going, like, yeah. I've been thinking about this for a few months, actually. And I asked Daisy too. And she's like, yeah, she, I know she likes chocolate. So, but I'm like, I need to know more cause. Yeah. Um, all right. Let me go by too much. But I love my notes. Oh, so there is something. I'm not really sure what it looks like and how to create it, but I think I might have talked about it last week, but I'm zeroing in on a different type of dashboard that I want to create, which is kind of like a client profile. Um, talking about something for Mark. Um, yeah, for everybody out. Well, I, for me.
00:09:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not not clarifying this, but that way. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.
00:09:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
measure all the things that are important and so like original goals that people have if I'm starting with them, so I can just kind of watch how they improve and track. And some of them will be financial, but some of them will just be, you know, how many hours in the office, although Mark spending a lot more than there. feel like that's actually. I mean, now, but he. wasn't and he wants to be able to not go into the office for a month or two if that's what he wants. And so anyway, but whatever people's goals are and just kind of tracking like the team goals, the revenue on top of it, but I don't so like I have all my notes for everybody, but I don't have it like I'd have to go through and remind myself what was what and I would like especially because I work with people for years to go okay this is what it was and you know the year we started and this was the next year and the next year and just kind of look at each of those things that we kind of touch on over time and just see how it's evolved but also how they've evolved because sometimes the the values change um like marks goals have gotten a little they've changed a little but they're more clear so like before it was I want to play because I want to play And then he added more things onto it and part of it became his dad wanted him to do this deal and It's kind of a thing between them like he would have taken his dad on it and But anyway, so we're just thinking about that, but I think that that would be a helpful thing and It has a multiple applications So like if we created something and I have no version to show you But there could be something like this for like mom for your artists and for any product Products you work with like okay in a very simple thing. It just be a spreadsheet There's no software needed for it because it's basically verbal extraction where we get this information in the first place in Terms of like where they're at and how they see themselves, but also the actual measurable data so we can report real data also And then you know where they are like so what was their fan base when they started with you and and what was their schedule like when they started with you? How often were they putting out songs? You know what I mean? Like all these different types of things that matter because so let's say a person is like this isn't working, well tell me how it's not working. So we really only have certain types of metrics like followers and like revenue, right? But there are other metrics that affect the metrics. So how often are you meeting with your band? How often are you writing and composing new songs? How often are you putting out new songs? How often are all these different types of things, right? And then they'll also see the correlation. So let's say you onboard somebody and you ask them these things. What's your schedule look like? What are you doing? know, what's your output, that type of stuff? And then as they are spending six months or a year with you and you're giving them systems, but part of the system is we're telling you you need to do the stuff consistently and so they just change their behavior. That behavioral change is a real value. It's not something that like you can see a direct relation and revenue but it may not happen right away but it's a real value and you can see the different things that happen as a result of it. Anyway, that's something I've been thinking about. What do you think? Any thoughts?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yes, I get it. I think that for you, well for anyone but for you, like yes it would be a totally different set of metrics for a band and for like a teeny client. But yeah, it totally makes sense. But so for you, it would be, I would think, that there's what you're trying to deliver to them through the coaching, right? is, you know, there's like whatever. Time for freedom up above whatever it is, whatever your metrics are, right? There's that's sort of the promise of working with Tina and getting on that whatever that name I said the other day, I love that name, the freedom, something formula, I was like, that's a good name.
00:14:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm back, I'm right that down.
00:14:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's in the notes or it's in whatever I said to John, don't even know how I said to do, but so there's that and then there'd be like the play and I think is a bad example, right? It's like they need to be, they need to be.
00:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that was not ultimately on my brain about that should be there to find a name.
00:14:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so you have like time freedom and lower stress, whatever there, so let's say you have these five things or that and then freedom of the framework is what you had.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah, there you go.
00:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I like that because it is literally what we've been talking about that you do, right?
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're like you get people freedom and they get fulfilled, right?
00:14:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that how they were fulfilled, right? So So even if we just take that name, right? So the freedom is you're gonna have time freedom, freedom from stress, freedom from whatever, right? there's five metrics there that you provide, which if you think about it, you could be like, these are really good things to do. And then fulfillment is the personal. Hey, I want, I want, right? So it's almost this separation between rocks, right? The rocks are the top line of tina metrics. And then the personal goals are personal rocks, right? So there's the overall rocks and there's personal rocks. And you can measure those both over span of time and you could look at them quarterly, right? You can do that, but they're also running. So implementation lives, for me, it's super simple. You just make a gravity form that has, right? The metrics are set for the level one. And then level two, you'd make a dedicated gravity form them, right? You kinda like you're gonna have a hundred clients at this level, right? are the people. people that you're only working with at this mark level. maybe you have a dozen, whatever it is. So making an individual Gravity Form for them, which is really just a duplicate of the first one. So let's say you make one for Mark, then you make one for Dan, and Dan's personal stuff is slightly different. But it's a Gravity Form for each of these. You send it out once a week via sequence, and they fill it out, it goes, it goes out a G sheet, and then you build the dashboard in a G sheet. So the G sheets tab two, the dashboards tab one, or to Google Data Studio, right? And then you can say, well, this one looks like this quarter. And then you can open it up to six months, right? You can start to look at it over time, it should be when they first start out, hey, what is your stress level one to five? You just gotta figure out what the measurement metrics are gonna be like, zero to five, what's your stress? Zero to five, what's your time freedom, right? And then they just answer that every week. And then every week, you just add them to that data's date. And you just have a sequence that peppers them. Hey, you gotta fill this out. You gotta do it every week. That's the only catch is getting them to do it. But I think they will because it's super simple. It will work on an iPhone because it's like a single page with a single form. And yeah, that would be very easy to implement. And then get Melissa to get Melissa into a pretty dark.
00:17:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was not planning. I was not trying to tap into damn brain for myself. was just sharing something that we could find a way to use for you.
00:17:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that was amazing. Yeah, I mean, I literally saw it while you were talking. I was like, oh, I know exactly how you built this. But I mean, it's actually really good because it does. It does give you a visual representation of what's happened. This is literally what you look like. This is what your pitiful light shirt looked like, you know, six months ago.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're right. So that's part of it. So I feel like sometimes, like for the glens types of the world, which I, you know, whatever, but, but sometimes even the, you know, my ideal people get caught up in this isn't working, this isn't doing anything. And even Mark was like, okay, we don't really need to keep doing this because, and I'm like, well, we did get results when you did the work, but you stopped and you weren't answering questions anymore. And you were punting all the time. And so he came back, but what I think it helps do is also create, first of all, accountability level, because if people stop kind of showing up and they don't mean not coming to calls, but just not doing the work, right, or they take a dip, that will show up there. But also when they, I think it helps them buy into the process. And because we've had to. Yeah. So I have created tiny versions of this sporadically, very sporadically, which is the thing I'm really working on trying to improve and really create like a system and kind of a schedule that is still applicable to people's individual pace. But it's like, okay, here's the signal, we're here, here's the thing and kind of go that way. But anyway, but which is just showing mark, okay, look, this is or even you sometimes everybody really at some point, just like, okay, here's where we were, here's where we are, here's what you did to get there. Let's not forget to do this thing and let's continue to do that thing and whatever. it will be in a, you know, first of all, it will happen regularly. Second of all, it will happen with more clarity and the biggest thing is it will be in that visual, like we really learned the power of showing people.
00:20:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
equal numbers and data in terms that they're familiar with because of frequency because we keep showing it right because we keep interacting with that data so it becomes much more familiar so there's less of a wait what is this wait what does that wait what does that mean and then look at it instantly and they're like oh yeah okay realigned recentered moving on and also just focus for like okay this is the thing that works more of the thing that works less of all the other stuff well it's also every week they'd be sort of passively visiting or revisiting their goals which they're never doing it's never they're never thinking about it they never sit down and go oh that's right i'm trying to have less stress this week right yeah so and then when they start grading themselves then it's going to be like i am not doing this where i am we're like i am i'm crushing them You know, and whatever it is like you might be like how's your time blocking going and they'll be like I Know that would be my answer terrible. It's going terrible.
00:21:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I Don't love it. It matters right now.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean I do really good on the Tuesday. Went that's absolutely true I do not answer the phone. I just do whatever I want to do and those I actually worked I was telling someone about that the other day like wait what I go yeah You just you just don't answer the phone and then it's like comes a shock to you But it requires you picking it up and tapping it and if you don't pick it up nor tap it It's not answered and then you just move on. I don't want nothing the world's not burning down Whatever the phone calls about like just like I was telling Jeremy like weeks ago He was I think he was like why do you always say Thursday?
00:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go because that's when I do calls Mm-hmm.
00:21:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What do you mean? don't I don't don't meet with people other than one and Thursday period End of story like occasionally occasionally on Fridays, but it's totally up to me But for the most part now, that's it's not available So oh wow good you could do this.
00:22:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No one schedules more important than yours new splash Right, and I'm gonna tell you this because okay, so a couple of things first of all Summertime with parents is a different kind of vibe not not just like for me, everybody's is a little bit different like you So I don't do major Stuff and I don't do as much accountability stuff during that time because It's more important to me That there's less stress in the in the home dynamic and just whatever so but September which is what we're coming upon like everything just goes super charge and push through and if you three and all three Q4 But the other thing let's see if I can remember where I was going just now oh okay so I've been having because okay so the thing that I was doing with Maria and still doing and we're actually gonna start talking once a week because she has lost her compass and I'm like I can hardly tell well yes I did say I know this bad um she's like the wheel of chaos they're like our dad died and he was okay so but I told her I can help you with that and so we're gonna talk regularly but um but you know I'll get to benefit from just her energy her experience and her brain and I'm dying to know if she's as legit as she makes herself out to be um I think she is and I kind of do too has made people millions and not really done well for herself yeah I have a feeling but also and I mean there's a lot to it but it's all really personal stuff that isn't appropriate for me to share, but I really think a previous marriage had a lot to do with that, though, so it wasn't just her.
00:24:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She definitely let me know some of that.
00:24:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, so and I'm I'm not telling anything I don't think has been around enough. So, you know, that's why I'll say that little bit. But yeah, anyway, so I think that I'll help her. But what we're working on is so trying to figure out what can I do to get somebody a result quickly so that they're like, oh, she knows something I haven't been seeing and can get me some results, even if I don't hire her one-on-one, right? So group coaching and core stuff. So I picked something called timesheet homework, and I don't remember if you and I ever did it. We did it something around effective hourly rate, exercise when we like it was a few years ago, trying to figure out where your time went and where it should be going and what you're earning. Don't remember if I actually- They showed you the spreadsheet and it was called timesheet homework then. Now, I'm calling it time and profit maximizer, but what it is is you write down all the things that you do, what makes the most money, what makes you money, but is really tedious, has to be done, cannot not be done, but you hate doing it. What doesn't have to be done? We're just time being wasted, blah, blah, all that stuff. What are you great at? What do you suck at? What energizes you? What doesn't energize you? And then from that, people very clearly can figure out where they need to be delegating. What they should not be doing at all and almost, well, every single time, there's an aha of, I should be doing X way more because that's really what makes me money and I'm getting bogged down in the minutia every single time. So she went through it as we were talking about it and she had that exact epiphany. She's like, holy crap. I do almost none of what I should be doing most. But then I went to a previous, it wasn't even a client, it was so what I made my freedom systems which had this assignment in it 12 years ago and he went through it and he said this was worth the whole $97 course, 12 years ago. And it was this exercising them, so I just reached out to him. don't know if you know who Tyler Ellison is, and he helped us grow sheer strength labs with Ryan Moran and Tyler's also a person that Ryan never bothered thinking. But anyway, anyway, I was like, I remember you saying this to me once that that was that exercise alone was like life-changing and worth the price of the course. I'm like, I'm curious about staying power. I'm curious if that exercise, because my premise is that if I teach you how the fundamentals work, and I teach you how it works for you by asking you some questions and just telling you some stories that make you see how it can show up for you. If that information will stay with you and change you forever, like I think it does. That's been my experience, but I wanted that was over a decade ago and I haven't talked to him or worked with him for that long. So I wanted no staying power. He said 100 percent, it is life-changing. It affects him still, like he's still using everything I taught him. He offered to give me a video testimonial and I, so that's the thing about these fundamental processes, whatever. Anyway, so for you, this is the whole reason I said this to you though because you have, I don't know, you do get some resistance to some things. You're like, yeah, I should do that. And then you just like kind of notch lot. I don't do it, but I don't push. to you very much because you still you're always pacing something really well and to me that is the the most important thing like is if we're winning mostly winning I don't care about all the other ways things that we could be doing you know what I mean but I want I'm telling you this because I want you to buy into doing time-tracking maybe just really good just once a year for a little while or maybe twice a year because there's always so much of a shift in I don't know that there's so much of a shift and I don't know that it's always maybe because we've been working together so long and you know how time just kind of like collapses and ten years ago was like a minute ago and a minute ago was like ten years ago but I feel like sometimes in your cool things with cool people and puzzles that um and I do think that you're doing a pretty good job of prioritizing because here's where I think the priorities come up really well calls on specific days making music every week cool things with cool people not a lot of the tedious stuff so to me that that is the greater value but with the goal of getting that market share of another 71 that increase um with another 71 being the biggest lever for your freedom to continue to be whatever you want to be um do whatever you want to do and have the money for that and provide for your family and and it's gonna grow right girls are probably gonna probably get married probably have some kids who knows these days but um anyway Just thinking about a little bit more strategically, I don't think it's unstrategic, but even just more refinement basically, into where time is going for the next few years, I think that the time exercise, the time tracking and the time blocking with a little bit more specific intention, a re-evaluation of goals would be something really good for us to do next month, which is next week.
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But anyway, that's what I've been thinking about. Next month, which is next week, that's fun.
00:30:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, I mean, I don't want to, is it fine or is it, you know, yeah, whatever or is it like that's probably a good idea, probably useful.
00:30:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, as I've expressed multiple times throughout the years, I don't make goals, I make destinations, and then I manage to get there by saying that's where I want to go, right? Because I don't, I think my problem with goals is they usually have like a time associated with them, and I don't always to the tone associated with it, but I want the destination. So some things can be reached, you know, to switch from, I'm only doing all meetings on Monday, that was a week, right, right, to switch to, I'm only doing other calls on Thursdays, that took a little longer because I was like, I kept sort of letting it slide and saying yes to a Wednesday and yes to whatever. But then eventually I was like, no, I might do that. But that was probably a couple weeks, that making music on Fridays, right, that was like, okay, I'm, I did that with Sean, right, by meeting with Sean every Friday, I established that. So I established that through using somebody else. And then I have pretty much maintained it. mean, now I make music all over the place in Fridays. So, yeah, I'm, you know, I was just thinking about it like yesterday. It was like, I let something But that I was working with those dent guys and then the owner came back and then I just told my buddy out You know what? I don't want to do this And he's like what I go. Yeah, just don't want to do this. What you mean? it really boils down to like it's not my idea Therefore, I mean it is but it's not it actually I said it's not really my idea Although it kind of is but really the problem is When it was when I was working with you as the person of the outside, it's fine But the only way this works is if it's my idea and then I have a willing participant And a willing participant has to provide feedback. They have to answer questions They have to use they have to use the things. Yeah, and if they're not gonna use the things It's just not gonna work So I was like if you come back into the fold if and if that's if that's nine months from like great We'll pick it up in nine months, but I'm not working. I'm not working anymore. I'm done Even like okay And whether he comes back or not, I don't care. Right. I don't really care. And then it's like we're getting closer and closer to, you know, fan flowies. We got a couple more things. just sent the web. I'm going back and forth with the dudes right now. I'm building the website template. great. And now I'm trying to get them to do this version for me. Let's see. I literally just sent him all your emails for me on the phone. Hopefully he understands what I'm saying. But it sounds like he does. And then it's like, okay, if we can roll that out, that's where I'm like, all right. I want to then, and then I still need bases. Eric is like, no dude, it's happening. This is really happening. It's like cool. So those guys are just banging away on code with rank. They didn't even meet this week. They're like, we're just doing code. That's fine by me. You guys all agree. You and Frank agreed. like, don't let's not be let's just stay in Jira. It's like, okay, cool. So that's going. Yeah, he hooked up Jira. I've never used it, but it's for coders. It's code or project management. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's like a whole other thing. Very interesting company worth a gazillion in these two dudes start and also started. So it's like, I'm like, all right, but I mean, I'm still it's still the same thing. Another 71 grow another 71 which PS is now up to 3.5 million ARR. So it's definitely grown this year. My stupid frickin some of my GTM stuff is not working. Some of stuff I wanted to do is maybe not gonna work. I'm going back and forth with one of Mercy's four guys who's great. They definitely know their stuff. So but I also am not working on that today. So I'm still working out some of that stuff. Mushy did do my new customer thing, and it's exactly what I wanted, so we'll make sure that that's tracking correctly. And then I was working, I'm just, I'm still trying to, I gotta get that tracking in place, and then figure out, you know, if I could figure out where the new customers come from. And then we're still dealing with this weird year. And then I think Bobby, Bobby sent out something next year. There's 25 school releases next year, which is called The Hook. Yeah, that's insane. like, okay. And those are always good for us.
00:35:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I was like, okay.
00:35:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Next year could be great. And then I started, I think I'm getting sales on some of the new products and some ads I put up. The SEO's going really good with a curd. Um, yes, I mean. I'm still just focused on like, I really just want to do like, another 71 basis and think blowing, or mom, right? And that's it, if I can get those three, yeah, any semblance of whatever. And then if Kamala gets up high, it Kamala gets elected and they put this cap game thing in place, we are not selling another 71, so yeah, we know the red event, so we'll just sit on that.
00:36:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job.
00:36:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We will not be paying you any additional types of revenue, that is 40% F you.
00:36:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. it's not case in point, our conversation evolves so much, but to the point of just the principles, priorities, values, whatever, like, is the foundation, like that's the initial foundation, that's the first fundamental thing that we talk about, because for me, okay, for example, morning routines, and I talked to Mark about gratitude, mostly because he was Eor and just woo.
00:37:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is pretty much gone now. I know, I know, but let me let me get through this whole train of thought because I'm not I'm just saying talk, flash in and losing it really fast. Oh, yeah.
00:37:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, yes, it is mostly gone, but that didn't work for him, right? It was not his value. So he had to have something that was his value. The dog was his value. old day was his value spending time with her. And so he took her for walks. Well, she's gone and he's still walking and it was crazy that he's like, I walked five miles. was like, that's like nine miles, but I was like, yeah, that was that was wild. So but anyway, but you when it so that thing, right, is you're like, I don't, I don't set goals. But but you kind of do their. just not most people's goals. Yours are cool things with cool people. That's not a destination and it doesn't have a date. But it does have a spectrum, the spectrum of the quality of the cool things and the cool people. And people have fallen off the spectrum on that path. And like Francesca, like Glenn, things like that. Like this thing that you're doing with the guy, the dent thing, it is a refinement in terms of clarity about what you want and what you don't want. You do three examples. The Monday meetings, only having calls on particular days. I can't remember what the other things were anymore, because my brain. But everything that you listed, I'm like, we had a conversation. And in the middle of that, because you're like this, each of these, three things took a week. And I said, in the middle of a conversation, you're like, okay, this is what's gonna happen. You made a decision and then you pulled the trigger. And then next week, I was talking to you, you're like, yeah, I did this. And I was like, what the? But it still came from conversations about things like, where is your time going? And how do you feel about where time is going? So it's really not very different. The only difference is I have through and do that. And, you know, time blocking, like, I don't really do time blocking. I don't do it in my calendar. I do it mentally. And it's very similar to you because my value is, I don't want to live in a calendar, even though I'm aware of it. But I am looking at it constantly. But I choose the things that matter most. And then I make sure that those, like, those are my big rocks, right? Those are the things that get the most time. there's room for other things, there's room for other things. But what matters most always is getting done. So anyway, yeah, so we could just like have a little bit of a conversation, go through the exercise. What I think would happen is rather than like sending any more specific goals, it's just an evaluation of is the way that you're spending your time right now, and I'm not talking about time blocking, but case in point, the example of where's your time going, where's your energy going. I don't want to have calls on these certain days. It's really me off. I'm not going to do that anymore. So that's the kind of conversation I'm more thinking about having with you is a modified version. But there's a foundational process that I use that helps me to be able to kind of facilitate that conversation, but you're still the one that shapes it based off of how you want, how things matter to you.
00:41:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is that full of things with cool people is a principle using your terminology. That's not a principle.
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really principle.
00:41:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And I do have no drama principle. Oh, yeah. And then the goals are like row 1% a year. You know, work on program, yeah. Yeah.
00:41:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goals. 1%. I already know that I'm just writing them down again, because then I'm going to create my thing.
00:41:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah. And it's like a 1% market.
00:41:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I know what it was. Yeah.
00:41:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I'm reminding myself. Oh, yeah, which means being clear on what the market is and all that. Yeah. Principle slash values. Yeah. So drama thing is a big thing. Cool things with people. Solving puzzles is another one though. I feel like that's kind of both a value and a goal. It's that you always have a good puzzle to work on. Because I don't agree that goals, OK, goals are specific, measurable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, But, I don't think that they have to have, I don't think they have to be finite-based.
00:42:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, because it is the T time. don't even know what it is, right? Time-based or something. What? The T in smart is time.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's time-based.
00:42:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right the 1% is for you
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just doesn't have an entire specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound, but for me, the time bound that just sounds so risky, right? But for me, the time is not relevant if the goal is growth and expansion in that thing, which is how I set my goals. It isn't that I want to arrive at a destination. It's that I want to be further than I am now, and I consistently want to be further than I am now, because my destination is probably greater than I can even comprehend.
00:43:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you could twist it, right? Tweak it and be like, yeah, it's time bound. And you could say with regard to not a deadline, right? So it's time bound in that you're going to look at this every quarter. You're going to look at this every month, right? So you could sort of, it doesn't, the time bound doesn't have to be a deadline. I guess, I mean, I just don't have deadlines for the most part.
00:44:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:44:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or the big ones.
00:44:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And one of the things that I tell people too, especially if we have something that's kind of obscure and a lot of the things that we want are obscure, especially when you're paying attention to this energy and when you're just like, stuff is happening and I'm just here for it, right? But you're really intentional. You're on purpose, you're doing the work. It's not nothing, but there's a little bit more intangible that's happening. so I like to tell people don't, you know, look back from a year from now. What was life like a year ago? What are you more clear on now? What is improved now? What are you more confident about now? do you have? What less stress do you have now? How's your schedule better? Like all of these different things. If you look back a quarter from now. Six months from now, sometimes it's not that big of a deal, but a year from now, a year ago, right? There's almost always some things that you can pick out and go, this is so much better than that. This is how much I've grown since a year ago, which is one of the benefits for me of getting to work with people so long as I can look at that and go night and day difference from last year on this or that or whatever. Anyway, reinforcing the not a deadline, but more like a journey thing. Yeah, okay. So you have to everything really for me for like where you're at with Mercer. This is almost being done and let's go release things that's gonna be where like, did you confirm that? How, what did you hear?
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where did you hear it from? Hey, I CPA puts it out, right? they run them so that they they released the 2025 schedule. So he like sent a screen cap of the year or whatever.
00:46:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's like the thing, huh? That's crazy.
00:46:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. then, you know, is that a double? What is that? Oh, God.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:46:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
triple? I think it's more than double. like double plus one, roughly.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy.
00:46:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And well, and then they've been down because of all the code.
00:46:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, yeah, it's certainly more than this year by a mile. I mean, there's only been like half that many this year. It's seven or eight maybe so far. Or not even that many so far. There's one coming up and then there's one in October or no, the next one is not until October. So there'll be like a two month month and a half and nothing. Whereas with 25, it's averaging two a month, which is Definitely not all of it. It used to be these would be even more sparse Back in the day That's when we did these huge Sailed days.
00:47:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they probably realized that there's a similar correlation for them too And I think it's a result of having six sections now and not four Yeah Except yeah, I'm a success to Stacy because I look across as something from her and I don't think she's seen it Okay, so I'm back Adler separate Do have a recipient there I Don't know what it's talking about Okay, um, perfect wedding timeline.
00:48:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
How's that going? So, Abhishek has been sending Norio all bugs, and Norio said that he thinks he'll be ready for some beta testers. Next month. Uh, the I sent Greg, I think Eric built it. So, we have the seething chart things. As Norio, alright, what are we doing? How do I get a lead from a seething chart over? He explained that's Eric and I. Eric, I'm pretty sure he definitely is working on it because I saw some stuff today and was like, that's going to be Eric. Um, so this morning I sent the design, the layout and design ideas to Greg with the scene chart site. Norio's like, you can search and read these now. Then that's what I will do. So, Greg got that and then, we'll follow that up with Rob. I haven't really thought about the site for that, but it's going to be a better site than what we have for the current version because we're licensing, you know, it's not off. So I've never been motivated to try to generate a lead for the other side or anything like that. If they happen to happen, if they don't, they don't really care. But my plan is to generate leads to the free seating chart site, get their wedding date, all that stuff. Renau will stick it into the Wolfr Active Campaign and, you know, market is free seating chart, put them into a drip sequence, but depending on their wedding date, they'll go into the app, they get complete access to the even chart, and then they'll see that, you know, it has, you know, online feature, but it's grayed out, but they can purchase not from, I don't think they can purchase from within the app. But they can link to purchase and then it will unlock the whole app for them based on their current user name password So yeah, super interesting to see right now to talk to anybody just go generate leads Yeah Yeah then just put to you know put the other the map on that.
00:50:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, there's the pop-up all I can so Every time we've converted to selling and we being different clients Selling like up selling inside of a membership area with that like you can see the other things that you don't have access to Either it's great out over the lock screen and then you click on it goes to the sales page or a Java script You know unlock is here whatever Compulsions so that's that just increased exponentially
00:51:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need to auto-expire them on their wedding table.
00:51:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you going to tell them now, should I give you a reminder for Stacy?
00:51:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A reminder. So, Bobbi, wait what?
00:51:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so like the menu items is here.
00:51:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He did it. He said it to me. Yeah, he's like, here it is. I probably didn't look at it.
00:52:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you forward it? So you need to, I'd really like to I don't think I only have a general and idea of money execution channel that I am part of.
00:52:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Huh? It's not in my slack. He said, it's a world I have to go find it.
00:53:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:53:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's what it's.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Super eyes. What's the status?
00:53:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so they don't get it. And they're like, they really, they just want their cake and eat it too. And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to happen. So they, we had like a couple exchanges. then they wrote me back like another lying email and I glanced at it and I'm like, I ain't going to have permission. But it boiled down to like, they, they, they think the value is in the effort and work that they've done and the quality of the code. I'm like, yeah, no, that's not how it works. wish it worked like that. So then, and then they're like, oh, you know, and then you're going to become. I'm a competitor, so I'm trying to figure out. I haven't put a lot of thought into it, but some thought into it. So they wanted, I guess I'll prioritize this. They wanted 420 grand for a copy of the code. I'm like, are you high? Like, what are you talking about? I go, that's 38x. Nobody gets that. Nobody gets that kind of multiple. So then I told them, no, your business is like stub, 100,000 a year. Your value is more based on a seller's discretionary earnings formula. Here's that. Go ahead and run that. And PS, the X on that is one to two based on your gross revenue.
00:54:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:54:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I mean, it's not even, it's worth, you know, max 20 grand max as it is. And then they're like, well, you know, then you're going to cannibalize us. I'm like, cannibalize what? You don't have anything. So they just believe in the idea, right? you don't. You really don't, as if you did, you wouldn't have a job. Right? you're want your want to outdoors. Like I'm not going to say that obviously. Right? all right. Right. What I pointed out is like, there's also the risk of overnight you could be shut down. Overnight. Right? This is against the terms of service service, um, basically. And you can be shut down overnight. Payment gateway could be shut down overnight. You guys experienced it twice. Business shut down. So I'm like, there's not, it's very risky. So I have to figure out a way where like, they can participate in the upside. So it's either like, okay, you, you give me a hand. This was my original offer. I want a non-commercial license meaning I won't sell it. So I won't sell it and therefore I'm not competing with you. You can sell it. I'm not going to sell it. I'm only and I'm only going to and I'll pay you X per month guaranteed. But it could be like I do a commercial license and then so they get X per month guaranteed and then they get a percent of account like I'd have to figure out a formula like all right I'm gonna pay you a thousand bucks a month and four thousand bucks a month that gets me 500 active users and then when I get over 500 active users you get 5% of everyone over 500 you know I mean like something like that and then and then we decide on a value like we have to get a real value so that at any time I can buy my copy. I'll pay you to customize it which is 20 grand. So pay 20 grand, I'll pay you thousand bucks a month and now get me 500 users and then I'll pay you on if it goes gangbusters you guys get to Participate on the upside and but then at any time I can buy that code base off you for a fixed amount And or we decide to fix them out and I say every time I pay you I'm buying it Right, so you're gonna get 200 grand least don't yeah Yeah, yeah, it's like a lease on sort then you'll get the 200 grand, but at any time I could accelerate that So if we're down to a value of 190 I could just give you 190 and I'm out So something like or I mean but then yeah, so something like that and I haven't obviously I've thought about it a little but I haven't thought about it a ton and I just It's like there's no that the you know effect of hourly rate There's no effect of hourly rate for me to be like I gotta get back to those guys then If you add into the mix that mark supposedly and see this, believe them, they somehow stumbled upon running ads, I'm not sure this is exactly right, but I think this. So they found out that if you log into Instagram desktop, not that after your phone, and you boost a post through the desktop, in some way that's different than definitely different than running it out on Facebook and, you know, doing it that way, but also different from boosting the post internally within the app. They don't know how or why it's different, but it's different in that they're getting followers now for 30 cents, and super as gets a follower for 19 cents. So I'm like, that's not a bad trade-off, right? And it's completely legal, like a better term. So they figured that out like like over the weekend. So I think they've been doing it for a couple of days. And now they're like, all right, now let's do the process of manually DMing them. So part of me was like, the part that Instagram doesn't like is if you auto DM someone, and we are not doing that, we never done that. That was what I was going to have to supervise that into it. So then I was like, well, what if we just created an auto DM-er, right? So if we created an auto DM-er that doesn't look like an auto DM-er, right? And we'll be really smart about it, have it just randomly send DMs, switch the DMs up, but I gave that to the JD Funnels dude, I thought Spotify out there said, hey, look into this. The only thing I think the only problem with it is I think it needs to be a desktop app, because it can't be on a server. So this builds back to, and maybe we don't need to build super eyes, maybe we just need need to build an auto dm or app that's on your desktop and it just does that so you run ads and use that and then that's totally free like it's it's included with whatever oh yeah and then I download the dm or yes I haven't thought it through that frontal right now so I like oh wait that's it right there that's what we need to do and then we've got the other devs that I found before for the super ride but when I was going to build my own thing that might be the plane I'm probably causing a couple hundred bucks super simple and then we could just test it internally hmm it's a good Dina I told you my magic is asking questions everybody does that be lifting the sides yeah well that's little thing right I don't no one sits around and asks me what I'm doing
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
or why you're doing it.
01:01:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, but that's actually the play right there. You know what? That's not going to cost $420,000. Probably not going to cost a grand.
01:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I mean, there's so many different angles to it and it's like, well, I can be your competitor that you get money from or I can be your competitor that you don't. Not that you're actually the competitor, but you know what I mean? And there's other things. There's so many angles to it, but sometimes narrow minds can see the light and sometimes they can't. But regardless, you've got opportunities for days. There's so many different ways around it.
01:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. It's okay. have a call at 1.30 and thirdly..s.
01:01:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We met with Josh at eight.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And he, uh, he's like, yeah, we can do that. He, it's unreal how good he is. Mark and I, so I like, Mark, you need to go this tall because you get the bookkeeping side. And so we walked through it, you know, over a half hour or so. And Josh is like, yep, yep, yep, we can do that. We can build that and then Mark out of nowhere. I don't know if this is from, I think I only sent it to you. And I sent it to him too, where I was like, hey, we got to work on like the on track, I'll track dashboard. I thought that was just you, but maybe he was on there. He brought that up because I want to build the mega marketing dashboard or something and just like, that's a great day. That's a good, good job, Mark, the MMD. So Josh is going to build the thing that we wanted to talk about. And then this MMD and then he showed us some apps that he has that are super cool that I'm like, I don't know if Mark got it. I'm like, it's so funny when I look at something, I go, oh, that's interesting.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, if it's ever possible, I would love to be on a call with Joshua. I can just see it firsthand and download all of that. Or if you have a recording, cause I only have like this tiny glimpse into what he can do. But, um, like, that sounds amazing. Instead, but he could do more than maybe I could ask other questions. That would be that we've never had an option to get a lot of this stuff. Like we've been working with Mark for over three years and it took all of this time to find Josh. And who knows what Josh was doing. Speaking of like synergy and divine stuff and things are happening that we can't control or even bring into play. We couldn't make Josh appear and Josh have his skill and his knowledge. We had no control all of that. All we could control is what do we do when we need a Josh?
01:03:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You know what I mean? And what's crazy is that he was in the middle of this random video. I was watching and I was like I had to find that guy so it was like that's how How did you find him? I was I was researching something about Lidify because I'm like I'm not doing this I'm not gonna do it. Mark could do it and then whatever and then They were like in he was like being interviewed I don't know but it was like an interview YouTube video with like four views and I watched it and I was like Who is this guy and then I figured out one of my zoomed in on the screen Or they said the firm or they said his last name. I was like that's it's such a newbie last name and I found him Through his face and then I you know them. Okay, man.
01:04:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you do this and he's okay? Insane when you think about just I know you being you, which is let me go look at that and and That you don't disregard somebody because they've got like almost no views because some of the smartest people have like no Following on Facebook and they are insanely smart and very good at teaching how to do certain things, whatever.
01:05:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
anyway, he literally was on the call going, this guy is such a score. This morning, I was like, he is such a score. So quick, the thing that he showed us was we built this app for referring out his doctor refer or I'm sorry, it's for referring to doctors, right? So think of it in that context, like, yes, you have your doctors that you're referring to, but this is also to maybe refer to a new doctor. It's integrated into Lidify. And let's say that you're like, oh, this person means a pain management doctor. It goes to Google, you put in their, it pulls their addressing from their matter record. And then on the, so that's on the left side on the right side to Google map. And it pulls up all the pain management clinics in around that area. And I'm like, wait, what?
01:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, isn't that how you would build your doctor network, Mark? it's also how doctors find out their competition and that's very relative to the new plan I have yeah so I was like wow that's slick and then this other thing he had is this auto mailer like physical mail and you yeah and it integrates with i don't know did you recall no i don't know if did it was his car no it was it's google google so i don't even know if you ask if it's recorded yeah yeah or he would send a video on it okay um i want to hear about all of that stuff because whatever we can use for mark also mark is in business with the client that he gave me and there's probably room for dan in there too and something in terms of marketing because that's not where they should be spending their time like he does his own seo like why are you doing your own seo like the money you make that that's dumb but also, you know, you can always just find great SEO, but I'm pretty sure he does not do great SEO. Anyway, there's just holy crap, Josh. Yes, I wanna know more about Josh. And if you have more calls, either please record it or can I come because I wanna see that brain?
01:07:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't normally talk to him. This he requested, and I was like, Mark's gonna be there. Mark made it sound so complicated, and I was like, I don't think I was that complicated.
01:07:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the point, yes.
01:07:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I was like, and then, but it does, it's gonna involve manual labor.
01:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hi, how are you?
00:00:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good. So what's going on with you? happened this morning?
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to get my hormone levels checked because I get estrogen and progesterone. And also I need keep an eye on my A1c, which is, I have diabetes. I don't have it, but I don't want to get it and just keep an eye on it. But I normally have really tiny veins that are not very good to draw. But I've been taking Clariton because my allergies have been super bad, like my whole face hurts here all the time. all the time. Anyway, and on top of that, I'm about to start my period. So I'm extra emotional and extra sensitive. And she put the tourniquet extra tight so she could find it dug in this arm didn't get it.
00:01:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's the tourniquet on this one.
00:01:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's bruised from the tourniquet.
00:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then she told me she would not dig in this hand, but she did.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Finally got the blood three cubes, but the whole thing just hurt. don't normally cry from the pain, but like it was a lot today.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:01:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mostly, I think probably because of hormones, but, and I was going in feeling like I was about to have a hot flash. Haven't eaten because you can't it was a fasting lab. Anyway, so this morning is emotional and I'm just ready to get on with my day. Yes, last night, I was using I hate. This is my executive dysfunction. writing anything about myself. If it's for a specific purpose of teaching somebody and tell my story because this story pertains to what you are doing and it's actually about you being my training of my experience then I'm you know I don't think about it but so what I did was I went to chat GPT with the stories I'm like I don't even know what stories it has because I've given it so much stuff and so it wrote a lot of things for me for my history and then I went in found my trainings sorry let's see for things that I had created let me shut my screen assignment that that we had I think that it needs the next iteration, but for me, I can't even explain how much I hate this type of stuff and how hard it is for me to do, especially when I'm not feeling great emotionally. Yeah. But I did because I want to make traction. So, I have base camp training videos. Nice. I teach people, I taught people, this was 12 years ago when I first created about boomerang for Gmail.
00:03:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what that is? Yes. Yes. attempted use it as well, but I don't use it as much, but it sounds cool.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't. I mean, Gmail actually has integrated a lot of the features that Boomerang had and also taught about, yes, where I taught people how to filter their emails and use smart filters, so their inbox isn't full all the time. Let's see, reportive, and yes, where reportive is another Gmail integration that uses canned responses so that you can kind of automate, so yes, where, and reportive do a lot of the same things.
00:04:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And again, this was 12 years ago. I haven't been using them because I don't really need to because I barely work and I just have the same clients though, but that's not really scalable anyway, and not a real business.
00:04:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a job. Like I haven't dropped, let's be honest about that. Anyway, but reportive allows you to create different types of canned responses and connect with your team, so you can customize them for people and you can have those response times like Gmail lets you do a lot of things again. that it does, but it still has some other things. I had the timesheet homework, which is now the PTE Maximizer. have a video for that. I taught people how to use LastPass. I haven't gone through this, but I wonder what the webinar is. I had this program called Social Media Profits, like, because I had this partner was all about, we got to make money blah, blah, blah, this was not when he was my love, but he was just like an associate. He's very professional, like he won't associate the discord, but he always cared about me as a single mom, and he didn't want to see me be taking advantage of, and he knew things about my partner. so he would kind of try to get me to basically open my eyes, notice this thing, notice that thing and just kind of around it. and then anyway figured it out got rid of that partner and then ended up falling in love with my hero so yeah kept him nice love him anyway so um and so for i'll show you what and blah blah blah that was not good chat gpt and i got just kind of roughly which i need to assemble that's not it okay i'm going up there was a basically it took a few stories that i found and then it took some testimonials and turned it into um a story at one point it makes stories together and it put you in with my story coffee shop millionaire that was from like 13 years ago i'm like you know you're making stuff up now so um hold on a sec there's just a couple there's like one area i would show you and so my job is i'm just gonna take all of this and put it into a Google Doc and use it as kind of a framework to remind myself and modify it. Okay, so I think there was actually one more version after this that I like that one. Um, yeah, there's some things I have to modify here, but I've been an entrepreneur.
00:07:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you care if I read it? Like I feel like this is way my brain processes stop.
00:07:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, I've been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember. My first taste of running a business came when I was just 10 years old, babysitting in the neighborhood, then quickly expanding my repertoire to a paper route of 11 and mowing lawns as a preteen and a team. Even back then I wasn't just doing it for pocket money. I have my sights on something bigger. This is not mine. I knew I was meant to create opportunities, not just for myself, for others, chat, dbt, liberties. Yeah. And I don't even know where this story came from. So as I got older, I naturally gravitated towards jobs that would change me to think like a leader, also totally, whatever, made that up. I found myself working in corporate America where the stakes were high level. I would say this is it. Our jobs were constantly under threat of being outsourced to places like Costa Rica or the Philippines. You had the pre-work every single day, and there was this relentless grind of reporting systems that were painfully, anyway. Okay, so bottom line is that that's where I got started. I'll rewrite this, but it was that we were in a, and I might have told you this, but in, so let's see, I worked there from 1996 to 2002. And so we had Excited Home, Apple, Intel, Adobe, Visio, all under one roof in a call center. And I, at the time was working, at the time of discovering this, I was working for Intel, and so my job was a technical team lead, but it was basically a business within a business. So I was responsible for staffing, 30 percent team, 24 hours a day, and I was responsible for hiring, coaching, terminating, so everything there, and then meeting corporate metrics. So Intel had a contract with Sykes, which was the company that I worked for, that we would answer calls within a certain amount of time, that we would resolve the calls within a certain amount of time, and at the call, the average length of the calls would be a certain amount of things. So that, those were our metrics. If we exceeded those metrics, there was a bonus, if we failed to meet those metrics, we didn't, we were penalized significantly financially, we didn't even get our contract. That would happen. And there would be this phone call from Sykes corporate office. Well, first from Intel corporate to Sykes corporate, then to my building. And then everything flowed downhill.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so we'd have this emergency meeting.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somebody's going to lose their job because we're in districts. OK, well, how come we didn't know that in the first place, and how come we weren't taking care of it, and I'm tired of getting threatened? Meanwhile, most of this stuff and most of these, even the managers were industry level workers. And all the job was on the job training. So most of the people didn't care. It was just a good paycheck.
00:10:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They didn't have the work, flipping burgers, whatever.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But I didn't want to be threatened. I didn't want to go flip burgers. I dropped out of college. I wanted this to work. I also really loved the technology, and I loved what I was learning. So anyway, we had a Lucid technology phone. I know those big black phones that have those buttons. on them like tons and tons of buttons on them. So those buttons had all these different modes where you could put yourself. So one was like waiting for a call, one was you're on the call, one was hold, one was transfer, one was called ACW, which is after call waiting where we would write our notes, whatever. So all of those different things had metrics, but tied to that was the technology that allowed reporting. So the phones could, there was a server that tracks how long each phone, because each phone was programmed with its own number. So how long it was in each of those modes and during which time we even used it as a time clock, that was where you logged in and logged out at the end of the day. So, you know, 1996, 2004, this technology was there, but the reporting was archaic and it didn't really exist. I can't really say archaic because it was still pretty modern at the time. But what it wasn't able to do, who spit out a report that automatically told us are we in metrics or are we not that did not exist. So after about the third time being this position as a manager and going through one of these types of meetings and being like, you know, cortisol pumping through my body, maybe in short style, like what's going to happen. Like I got to figure out how to know ahead of time where I stand so that I don't go, am I the one? Is it me? So what I found out was that where there were five reports that that the loosened phone system had that if I put them into a spreadsheet and did a few formulas, I would know exactly where we stood. So it took five of them. Now, again, I so when I started working there was 21. And when I left, yeah, hold on, 2000. Yeah, something like that. No, actually, I think it started when I was 19. So anyway, again, and this is 1996, like emails brand Like technology, most people haven't been using computers, word processing was basic, knowing Excel was not something that everybody knew. few people knew it. Google Docs didn't exist at the time. So I had a friend, he was also LDS and nerdy, he was in Excel all the time. like, can you show me this? Cause I saw what he was looking at and there were formulas and numbers, I was like, is this? And so I asked him if there was a way that he could help me do this thing that I was trying to do with these different reports to make these calculations. so he helped me put some calculations in. So I had five different tabs in one workbook. And so I would dump each of the reports into five tabs. in the mornings, I would go run the report, copy and paste it into the five, just raw data tabs. And then I would have a formula on the fifth one that would do the calculations to see. So it took me 15 minutes. That's all it took. 15 minutes to find out are we a metrics and are we not and which agent of mine out of my 30 people was in metrics and which were more which meant I could then go coach them and I could look at why like because we already did call tracking but we didn't have any data to measure okay I can tell you if you did this good or bad but I can't tell you are you doing it with the end the amount of time you're supposed to be doing it because they actually implemented that corporate worldwide and it was a worldwide company and I never got stressed out about those meetings again because I was always in metrics I hired better from that because I learned to profile people looking at that a little bit better I had a brand new epiphany so everything that I do for my clients has stemmed from the experience of being under constant threat of losing my job and watching watching the cycle of Easter, right? Like, Hey, we're all good. all good. Oh, we're gonna lose our jobs. Like we, the sky is falling with really analogy, because nobody thought anything was wrong and all of a sudden we're being pulled into meetings and we're being threatened with our jobs. So, um, but it was, it was looking at metrics and figuring out that there are certain numbers that matter and have to be measured constantly and they have to be managed to constantly. And if those things are done, then everything else is kind of smooth sailing. So anyway, then went and applied it to these different things.
00:15:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is So, why did you stop selling the coffee shop millionaire?
00:15:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I quit working for them.
00:15:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, so I never sold it. Oh, sorry. thought that was your product, but you're right.
00:15:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was this other dude. I remember this now. Yeah, yeah. And he called me on a Sunday and kept calling me and texting me and I told him I don't work on the weekends and I do not talk to anybody on. Sundays. And he was like, I know you're there, like, why aren't you answering? I was like, Oh, I had no other money, no other income for kids going through a I was already going bankrupt because I was making them all this money and they're paying me $15 an hour. And he wasn't going to treat me like that on top of it. Like, bye. So he tried to hire me again a couple times after that. But yeah, anyway, yeah, they had no structure. And then was your strength, your strength labs, they were doing good. I just came in and they did much, much better. Like, regs, this is what Matt Davis said they were doing 400,000 a month. And that I, and then they sold the company for $10 million a couple years later. Do you have a testimony from them saying they went from 400,000 most to eight, I do Matt. And you know, the only way that I got it was because he wanted to hire me again. Yeah. And because Ryan wasn't going to give it to me. So this is what Matt said. Something put Tina keeps getting us results in. She came to help out our company when we were having some growing pains and needed to help cleaning up our systems. At that point, we were doing a few hundred thousand per month, fast forward, 12 months, and we've increased our revenue tenfold. Tina played a huge part in helping us to do this rapidly. She took our ideas and visions and made them a reality and we couldn't have grown this fast without her. That's 100% too. So what I did for them is I put everything in base camps. They had meetings on a regular basis and they were not due dates and they were not accountability. So Ryan did a really good job of saying what he wanted done, but he didn't want to manage anybody. And Matt had a very different personality. He just had his first baby. And he did research, whatever. They were very different personality types. then on top of that, we had a... a media buyer was just either Ellison and graphics and things like that, everything had to be coordinated and done. So there was nobody keeping track of anything. And it was just the virtue of keeping track of everything, having 18 meetings. So we were all on the same page and me saying, okay, who's doing that? When did you get done? then the week, okay, where we are because you haven't said there's any problems. So I'm expecting it's going to be done on time. And a few times of, well, no, it's behind and a few times of I didn't get it done, but I didn't say anything and me going, okay, that's unacceptable, either fix it or we find somebody else stuck out done. So, yeah, those were my biggest, I do have like the other stories would be testimonial stories that I have from people and they're they're good. But the thing is, I haven't worked for a ton of people. What I've stated. in areas and done well for a while. also, I never worked more than 20 hours a week. And a lot of people have locked me in experience, but not in efficacy. And that's really kind of the whole thing about it. So anyway, that's that's my homework. have some trainings that existed that could be repurposed and just kind of refreshed a little bit for just general tips and tools and a story behind it to say, this is what these types of simple systems, that's the thing, they're not none of them are complicated. about this is super fancy. about anything that I do is really exceptional. It's not it's not I show up consistently and I measure the things that matters and matter and I manage the things that matter every single day. And that's it. And don't allow distractions too. So this is the other thing is, each of these companies and owners would be like, well, would be cool if, and want to do other things. And I would say, okay, if you do that, are you still going to get this done on time? If you do that, is that more important than this thing? Because every time you've wanted to go off and do this, then you neglected this.
00:20:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I have refused to work for anybody that sabotaged the work that we've agreed to do.
00:20:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm either staying on task or I'm leaving because you're sabotaging my ability to do my job, and I'm not going to deal with that kind of stress.
00:20:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And it's not sort of what you're doing for Dan right now? Ryan?
00:20:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Ryan? Yeah, it's what we did. But having been seven years in, he doesn't really have to be in questions. asked you, well, why do it that way? And it was cost or have you followed up with this? So because he does have a lot of different things going on. But the difference with him and everybody else is that his pace is very chill and laid back and can be because he's got a business that runs like clockwork and does really well. And even when something goes wrong, it's still really good. they have to check out the page just and they bled money and he like, it'll fix it. It'll work.
00:21:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anybody else will lose their mind.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Dan is really like not one to compare to anything else. But I would think, um, see, he is not a testimonial kind of person. He has said something before.
00:21:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, there you go, Tina, that's the best you're ever going to get. it was amazing. I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Remember when I had to call him, he showed
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that fun. I think it was a CPA thing or a counting thing or something like that.
00:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's like this. Yeah. Okay. So it's Chris. Yeah.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Dan Meredith, it was, was wanting to get into copy. He was copywriting, but he was kind of new at it and he had his gym. But he did everything on notebooks and he just, I think he didn't define his values in the beginning. And so that was one of the conversations. And then it was stick to them, you know, and his values were shifting. And that's something that people have to take into account because values do shift generally until you kind of lock into your real core values and then they really never shift, not the main ones. But there's a point in most people's lives where they're shifting, shifting, shifting until they lock. I think kids are locked in now, but then they were definitely in flux and it was just the conversation about what you want, be clear about what you want, be honest about what you want, be aware of the way that you're sabotaging your opportunities to get what you want and stay focused, stop trying to please everybody, stop trying to, you know, don't say that you want to be a business owner and then also want to go play and do all these things, like which one matters most? If you want to play most, be honest about that and go do that. But don't act like you're a business owner that you care about the business. And so those are the conversations to have with a lot of people and like I've got one client and he's an eight figure client and he wants a lot of growth and but what he wants most is freedom. And so, the kind of growth that he wants requires more management than he wants to put in, and I said, that's okay, but you just have to be aware that there's this disconnect and pick the thing that you want most and the thing he wants most is to not have to show up in the office when he doesn't want to show up in So, then you have to be okay with, you know, 80, 20, right, this 20% of the time that you're not there, that a lot of stuff is just not going to be optimized and working the way that it should, but it's so profitable, and it gives you everything else that you want, except for the massive success that you want, you know, you have to be with the trade-off that you're not getting to the level of accomplishment that you want to, because the other accomplishment is you have a ton of freedom. Freedom and happiness that other people will never have.
00:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, true. Um, I wanted to also though, uh, I kind of, I didn't do my story all that yet, but I did do, I listed off a whole bunch of products and I had a Google She already for some other products with my own possible brand name, but I wanted to segue straight to Joanne because like, oh, yeah. Sorry. It's okay. It's okay.
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I have a three o'clock.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I got half an it's all, it's all good. And so like, do we want to just see what she's given me already?
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, because I haven't even gone through all the stuff that she sent over.
00:25:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's been crazy. Either by either by.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll let you share.
00:25:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Just to have a gander here, some stuff I just started filling out. I have like so many things, like micro offer magic is my main course, but I have like from likes to members. 7-figure offer launcher, I-impossible sales system, traffic and sprint workshop, I-impossible sales system. I'm all over the map, ADHD, can see, I have e-commerce email promotions, swipe send profit, I-impossible success system, that was like teaching people how to make their first 1K and was like a Facebook group. I have scale of challenges and also the ultimate challenge masterclass is challenges kind of on the OG for way back in the day before everybody else is doing them. Ultimate webinar, and that's how I made my first million through those $17 challenges. Ultimate webinar sales, visibility workshop, ultimate Facebook group, cash injection, I wouldn't look at this now because I don't believe in Facebook groups as much right now, even though people are still using them, love and ways to grow good fast and then old stuff, like we're talking like from more than 10 years ago, get published mastery. Well, this one's not 10 years, this was three years ago, this was a 3K, six month cohort, I mean like 25K. one month selling it, a social sales system, just teaching people how to make money on social sales using Facebook groups or Facebook or social media and bring them to a book or call funnel or selling, know, cohort. Fast-cast mastery, these are old ones now. If I were to say the first ones, this was the first one. The first one that really took off, I had the ultimate consulting challenge. I think I first sold for a buck and five bucks. Thousands went through it. Like I had 6,000 buyers of this low ticket that I increased at four and I said, this was a great kind of catalog model to everything else because as I got all these buyers, then I would have an ultimate Facebook challenge because to be a good consultant, they needed no social media. I would have mobile challenge to be a consultant.
00:27:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They needed to learn how to also deal with mobile optimized websites because remember, this is like 12 years ago.
00:27:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Then I had social media challenge because being a consultant, they needed to learn how to use social media. same thing to make it's all you hadn't learned video. So that call me calm automated in me offering a social media certification program down here. And that was a 2k program that certified people in social media. And that was back in 2010 or 11. So I sold 200,000 one week social is at that time no one had a social media certification. Everybody knows brother has that now vacation.
00:28:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I guess before Kate Buck had social media manager pro.
00:28:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is before Kate Buck existed. This is back.
00:28:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was great.
00:28:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, was. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Social media certification program like innovator. Yeah, like the thing is, you know, what means I'm usually always innovating on what's trending right now and using what, you know, kind of like a superstructure what people all know and stuff. And I had momentum like once I had this all going, I had such momentum.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that had been costing though.
00:28:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was because every month I was launching something new. It totally was right, but I had team like I use these and that's different. Yeah I was using base camp.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had a really good team like you know, and I had a lot of JB partners So it was I was I was true leader like in the CEO of the of the business We were making at least a hundred thousand a month and I was you gonna have a great podcast episode about this and break this down And some trainings about what because there are different seasons, you know And we use stuff like that and like I was the first thing I was gonna say My head is like that was not a leverage business except for you were leveraging trends For business opportunities and revenue opportunities because another thing I was thinking Earlier today. I was like I would never do X. I would never do X. Like all I was listening to a podcast They were talking about the restaurant business and how hard it is and it's such like Fin margins. I'm like I would never do that and I'm like but what if that was the only thing I could do to make money What if that was thing I knew, what if I had no other skills, like, yeah, what mind to say, I would stick up my nose and say, I would never do that. And also where he if nobody did that. And so I kind of caught myself in my ignorance and against, like, I, because first of all, I don't believe in infinitives for the most part, never always this type of thing. Because for the most part, I think there are very few things that are eternally and infinitely ever true. But that the seasons are really important. And I think as coaches or consultants or whatever or leaders or teachers, is that we help people understand that there is a season where something does not make sense for you, don't do it. But only you can know that and other times where it does. But like, because if you go listen to somebody who's telling you to do something that's not compatible with your season, your environment, your skills, do our values, et cetera, then you are creating, that is a recipe for disaster on a spiritual level, on an emotional relationship level, like anything that you do something is just so counter to those particular things, an environment, skill set, relationships, values, whatever. It's destructive inside and you'll just implode in. But this is amazing, all of your things. You put time, could you put a timeline to the left, roughly like 2010, like drag it down for whatever ones you did in that area?
00:31:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure, I'll do that later just because I want to talk about it. Sorry.
00:31:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's so much.
00:31:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just like, whoa. Yeah, no, no, I've been thinking about that too because they'll even show people how many products I've created and stuff. video ads made easy. was more in 2016. That was before people were teaching about video ads. Because one of my nephew, I brought his e-comm company to 1k day in sales using video ads, and we sold it 18 months later from startup for over a million dollars to venture capital company, that to e-comm company. Facebook ads scale, that was probably 2020, Black Friday, Cyber Monday Toolkit, that's probably 2020.
00:32:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, is that what made you post the...
00:32:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I just have to change dates, like the email's already done and everything, so yeah. That's awesome. Email-deliverability class, I actually did that a few months ago because I wanted to start doing some master classes to then put into little ticket funnels.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You looked as crazy as I started teaching about that in 2000, it was with coffee shop just talking about it, and it's actually how I had my first conversation with my sweetheart because he had an email list. So they were getting 10,000 names on it a day.
00:33:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he's like, whoa, yes, 10,000 names, 10,000, 10,000 often today.
00:33:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's big time. Yeah, but yeah, but they, but they didn't, but it was a new thing to be thinking about sender scores and reputation and inbox placement, that kind of thing. But but I was learning about it because it was impacting us at that time. So yeah, yeah, yep.
00:33:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, wow, that's pretty well. Anyways, okay. So I'm just going to sit you this alive.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, well, this is shows what it's probably so you are.
00:33:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm so glad you did this. And Frank Kern promoted this, by the way.
00:33:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was funny. I found him on my list when I was looking through my email list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Frank at Frank Kern dot com.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was funny. Yeah. So okay, so let's go to this girl by the way. Hey, I did post another comeback just for the hell of it. Hey, I'll do a done for you funnel. I don't know if they've released it yet. Uh, but I said they have to have $20,000 working capital. So just FYI just posted that today. Um, just to say my self time because people have been reached out to me, but they like want me for implementation and they want something for cheap.
00:34:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyways, it looks like I've improved yet, but all right up in here.
00:34:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what was, uh, that's the thing though. So this time next week, Maria, if we, if we spend this, we really, um, putting these things, these two things together. And even if we just like record ourselves having conversation about the things that we've done and built and who we served, then go frame the offer after somebody can be like, who are you?
00:34:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've never heard of you. And then they go watch. This is what you did.
00:34:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean? Yeah, there's only once like glitch because it's Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend.
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I am. Taking Friday money. Oh, okay.
00:35:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's only glitch. It's FYI. I think it's Joanne, right? I was gonna dump her stuff into one of the Google Doc because she sends me so many things. Well, look at the free group. You should probably look at my new funnel. We are in the process of making. I don't want to get dropped into too much.
00:35:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's red clogs all over the place. Those are the types of people. They want you to work without money and you realize me looking at your stuff is you taking my time.
00:35:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, we could turn the table and look at something, make some if you want to continue with us and I can just give it the CMO.
00:35:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
COO's thing is that it hates 6,000.
00:35:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want to do this, like, or out? Or something else that's, yeah, because it's just, um, yeah, I mean, I can do two YouTube videos in the time that we took to talk to her that three hours that one night, then I would have, you know, tons of views on YouTube and build in my YouTube channel, you know, yeah, so I think it's important to see you see what if you can improve what we have, we have six, so that's the other end flag, we have six ages, she's trying fail, so I want to be fully transparent. So she repeats that a lot too, by the way.
00:36:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, what's the common denominator?
00:36:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Of why the agency tried to fail, I don't know.
00:36:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She is the common denominator. Her business is the common denominator.
00:36:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, because I can't believe that she would hire a new agency now and expect them to beat the past agencies when it's like the election month's coming up and it's most time to run ads. Yeah, you know, so she's probably going to complain about these guys, you know, unless she's because I said it, maybe that's in her ear now, both.
00:37:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
These guys. Well, the other thing is when you go into somebody like that, like the odds that you're going to succeed are slim and then your reputation is messed up because they go around, this person couldn't do it either.
00:37:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
not going to put myself in that situation. Yeah, so she keeps talking about this funnel. I was thinking while we look at the free group, we should probably look at my new funnel, so I'm just going to highlight this new funnel. So I don't know where what her new funnel is. I think it's important for you to see if can improve what we have. So really she wants us to come in and optimize her business.
00:37:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing. I never talk about this because it hasn't come up too much, but people have to have, so there's a minimum amount income to have at least... 50% profit margins so that they've got some working capital. She does not have 50% profit margins and she's got maybe like 10%, I don't hold on let me see, she said 2.6, so I to do this, 1, 2, well let me do this. What percentage of $2.6 million is $600,000? I'm just going to show my likes on 23%, yeah 23% margins, okay 6, 1, 2, 1, 2, divide by 2, I have 60% so I have no idea if you can see my animals but I'm going to turn my share screen off.
00:38:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay and because it's just really funny because the cat and dog are almost beside each other and that's
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
not that often you see the baby's where's the baby's oh barely see i know hold on let me let me try and reorganize this oh my gosh the cats in the cat bed and the dog is right there leading up against the couch oh is that funny i just don't see that that often love it really just looking away he's all tired up because he was at the doggy daycare i picked him up just about an hour ago yeah she's funny she's got that they're adorable she's got 23 profit margins and i mean there are businesses that have that but before it being virtual and i mean it's just poorly run yeah it needs a massive overhaul um it sounds like a lot of stress i'm not interested in a lot of stress yeah that's the biggest thing i as much Such as somebody's mission excites me is I'm not going to go into somebody else's home and and stay there if it's chaotic.
00:40:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and what I love what you just said, that's where we're down, honestly, like my energy just increased. I don't even notice it because it's like how refreshing will be able to say on a podcast or videos. Hey, if you if you have a business that's doing over $50,000 a month with 50% profit margins, we can help you. Boom, like it's that crystal clear, you know, and because I've been frustrated with the calls I've been getting over the last two weeks because. And I created the situation because I did three months ago, the 2k offer and then the 997 a month. So let me turn the box around silent. And yeah, I'm just like, the hell, I'm not going to work for you for for free or like especially with that one lady was like, why don't need a coach. I actually just need someone to implement stuff and she needs to figure out how to move her stuff to go high level. I'm like, I'm not your gal. So it's just like, I don't even know why I thought the pocket CMO COO doc was pretty clear, but then when they get on the phone with me, they want me to implement. That makes sense?
00:41:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it might be that they're mixing old offers with new ones and just thinking about something that they were already sold on in their mind before. And then you became top of mind again, but we feel the old offer. Now, they don't have to have those kind of mop, or the bigger the company gets, the less likely those margins will exist. So, you know, nothing lower than 30 if you're at 100 k a month. I don't want to, I'm not going to be there if it's less than basically it's about how much, how much money is being made and set aside. So 50% profit margins of 50k, there's, there's 25,000 left to be investing in people and teams and systems and ads. there's a reason that I said that specifically. Now, yeah, so it's, it's about knowing that you have enough to pay my fees. Yeah, plus ads and other people. So it isn't just a random number.
00:42:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So, okay, so let's see what else you sent us. Um, did she put this in frickin Googled?
00:42:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, she says she used a computer, right? Oh, that's a no.
00:42:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would not work with somebody who doesn't use She typed this app.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She sent chat GBT. Before she dropped that in, she says, I'm gonna go to chat GBT and get you something. So I think she did that there. Which was interesting. don't use Google Docs or have a computer, you chat GBT. Like that's, I don't know. Oh, I don't know how old she is, but she didn't do
00:43:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Brianna, she's in her fifties for sure. If they used to do the road tour of all the female singers back in the day. So, oops, showed. I know it's a little ugly, but, um, and then she gave us access. Let me know. I'll write to Marima partner to be on the call and give you access to everything and talk you through how we run TTM. Well, thought that's what the call last week was about, but took three hours. Here's the free community. Oh, I thought she gave me access to the community.
00:43:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So another requirement I have, Maria, that the so because everything that I was about leverage and optimization. Yeah. I. I don't work with anybody that is, um, not focused. I don't know if she wanted and she's not focused. She's focused on her goal and her mission, but not when it comes to structure and organization, like her mom doesn't, didn't even want to charge money. And she's like, I just like, she, she's focused on a huge number of revenue, but not margins. She didn't even know what her margins are. So what I won't do is teach somebody who's making that much money, business values, and act like I'll train beginners that stuff, not one on one, but through courses, right? But I'm not going to teach somebody who's already responsible for other people's lives and making millions of dollars, the fundamentals anymore, because there are that will work with me that I don't have to do that with. Like, there are people who are making millions of dollars and want the kind of help you and I have because they want to go further, but they're not a giant mess. They just don't have the person who will also, like they're leveraged and optimized in their brain, but they don't have anybody else who will do that in the business for them. So they have to be that person.
00:45:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When she does, she wants that, but the positioning would have to be incredibly clear. This is what you get from us. It's going to cost X. We're going to do this a little bit and your team is going to have to do the rest of it. We're basically going to tell you what should happen, give you the targets, help make sure everybody's clear on why we're doing it, how we're doing it, and then other people will do it. We will not actually do the work. will, you get our brains. you get our experience, you get our leadership, but we are not the operators.
00:46:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I am not anybody's operator. Yeah, I think that's the shift that I'm going through now, too. And that's why I find it interesting because some people like still want me to be their operator, you know. So yeah, um, available. Yeah. So, so it's still one core problem or problem.
00:46:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Brian Moran offered me 30% of a new company if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. But I don't, I'm like, I'm not interested in that kind of like this work.
00:46:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
wouldn't want it.
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, tell me Tina, everybody has a prize.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, you're set to douche back. You don't use a douche bag, yeah?
00:46:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. So, plays nice and tries to wants to be liked, but anyway.
00:46:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, um, what, what is she at the end of the day? So I'm in the, I'm in the Facebook group. This is breastfeeding, so we're in this group right, breastfeeding out. Like, there's two groups. is your question, please? One thing we would need to know is what's her org chart?
00:47:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I know she doesn't have one, but she'd need to create one. Who's on your team? What do they do? How much do you pay them? How many hours a week do they work? How good are they at what they do scale of one to ten?
00:47:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you want me to ask her to do that?
00:47:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, if you have any interest in working with her, you need to know those things. Because that's an asset you need to know. So, like, if you're not going to be the operator, somebody else is. Who would you be working with?
00:47:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, can you send us an org chart of your business and what their roles are?
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who works for you? First names, last initial. What are their roles? are their and Where are they located? How many hours a week do they work?
00:48:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And In words for you, including these include subtrumptor everyone.
00:48:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We need the names so that we can differentiate between people when we're looking at it. And know that, you know, like, if one person occupies two spots, we need to be able to tell.
00:48:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are the roles and responsibilities?
00:48:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where are they located? many hours a week they work? Yes.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do they work?
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How long have they worked for you? Scale of one to 10. How good are they at their job?
00:49:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else?
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What has your team consisted of in the last two years? What people were here in the last two years that are not here now. Why are they not here now?
00:49:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what has your team consisted of in the last two years?
00:49:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh-huh. That is different than what you have right now.
00:49:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Who's missing?
00:49:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're left, Who's missing and why are they missing? Because this is going to eliminate leadership issues.
00:49:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You mentioned one part in the moment. Okay, so I thought I had this opener messenger and it went back out, I like looking at one's bigger.
00:50:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The other thing I know we talked about it last week and I just want to reiterate it is that she's not doing us a favor, bringing us to the table of big deals. Yeah. You would be doing her a service, giving her the ability to actually handle the big deals that are coming her way and not tank them. There's no lack of opportunity to get money. is a lack now, but there are limitations to what we say yes to. If you wanted to go sell your soul, you could go find lots of people who would throw tons of money at you. you wanted to go burn yourself out, you could find lots of people who would throw big money at you, Maria. You know that. You don't want to do that anymore. No. That's been part of. probably a big part of the issue with their dad being gone is that there's something that happens when we lose people as we start to realize how fragile mortality is and how short it is. And so we want to spend more time with the people that we care about and we are more with their you were conscious of it or not. We're more conscious of the fact that you don't want to spend your time in places that steal from you the life that you do have. And so I don't think you were super like surface level conscious of that but I think your heart was like I can't. I don't want to do that stuff anymore. And even with what's her name? Boutique. Karina. Yeah Karina. Even with that like I think that that was probably more about I mean business business and you like business but also it was about relationships.
00:51:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
know you care about people
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that you work with partners and friendships. so that was the thing that your spirit is like, I need to like the people that I'm working with. And that was there. But then you weren't being honored properly. I know she had real issues, whatever. She wasn't holding up front of the bargain. So now it's just kind of realizing that there are trade-offs that are acceptable and trade-offs that are not acceptable. This is what's becoming clearer and clearer to you on a daily basis. And so these opportunities, but people even like Joanne, that's not super clear too, because she hasn't figured out what she sabotaging with her chaos or her, I want to make 10 million dollars. And even though she said I want to double the rate of breastfeeding, the thing that she repeated multiple times was 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars, 10 million dollars. You only said, I want to double the breastfeeding rate once. And that's when I asked what the goal of mission was. So the thing is she's actually focused more on the financial goal, according to her own language and energy, then she is on the mission of doubling the breastfeeding rate.
00:53:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I do find it confusing how to help her at this point, like, you know, I'm really thinking that it's probably not a good idea.
00:53:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think probably the best thing that we could do is, and if we were willing to be benevolent enough to do it, go through this together and say, okay, here's some of the things I would ask.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let her answer the questions.
00:53:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If she answers the questions that we gave her structurally, go in and say, look, the best thing that we're willing to do for you right now is give you an audit and we will make a recommendation, which is basically the COO CMO kind of pocket, but modified for her, which is an audit and these are directions we think you want to go. Now, if you want us to implement it. Here's what it's going to look like. It's going to cost you and we're still not going to manage it. We'll help you find an ops manager if you don't have one or project manager. Otherwise we will lead guide and train your manager. It will cost a lot, you know, because we're going to get our $500 minimum hourly and and something like that. But I think that that's all that we do is we give her structure and guidance and potentially train one of her leaders. And and that's just and it's truly honestly it's benevolence whether and if she doesn't see it that way and doesn't want it that way, that's okay.
00:54:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Bye.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look, everything will be fine. You'll find your people and we're glad to have talked to you. It's a great mission to have. But we have our own missions and they don't particularly align.
00:54:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it looks like they have the Thompson products. Like it's very weird like I don't even know what. funnel is right it's it's it's just one thing Thompson method for looks like one hundred percent off so it's probably two four seven always on sale she said all like once a month or something once every other month to bring in the cash which then makes it she could probably get to her 10 million by cutting that price in half well this uh this is what she says it for now whatever the price is if you made it because most women especially brand new moms who are learning how to breastfeed in the first place that's where they have a poorest when you're young and having your first child oh so you think this is too expensive hundred twelve twenty Canadian it's not that I don't think it's that valuable I think that that if they cut they could offer it to more people so there's different ways of scaling right um one of them is getting more cut
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Customers the other one is getting less customers more priced now. I don't know what the the support level is And I don't know if that's feasible But I do know that this particular thing is something that is more important at one season in life And that's your first baby And now I needed all the way with every one of my children because I never got it figured out So that's that's not the limitation, but it's most needed with your first baby And the first baby is usually when you're youngest and poorest So taking that into account in the market What happens if you reduce the cost? Yeah And you could even call it like a first baby special whatever doesn't matter if it is or not if somebody wants it and it causes them to convert We don't care for it's your seven baby.
00:56:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know Would a mother notice The order bump is discover how to safely collect in store of Colostrum and dr. Rob is masterclass for just $24 and learn whether it's the right to
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
choice for you and your baby's well being what is colostrum like so when you first when you're before your milk comes in um you and even while you're pregnant you ooze out colostrum which is loaded with antibiotics cows have it in fact i don't know if you've ever heard the supplement called armora um they sell it because now they get it from cows and people take it as a supplement so it's but but mother's colostrum is loaded with the most powerful vitamins and antibiotics for the baby to improve their health but once your milk comes in there's no colostrum it's just milk so but you get colostrum all throughout your pregnancy every month's different but i've never heard about storing that that's not a normal common thing you might be able to youtube it but i'm 48 half four kids and two grandkids and i've never heard about or thought about storing colostrum
00:58:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, what I'm also thinking is, is that, um, that order bump is probably terrible, uh, converting right now, because in the way that it's listed, yes, well, yeah, I don't even know if that should be the order bump, maybe some other different order bump, like for $7 something, like even maybe a meditation to calm yourself while you're pregnant, I don't know, but just I don't think a confused mind says no, and I don't think every pregnancy will know what the hell that is.
00:58:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, I think they will, yeah, if you've studied anything about breastfeeding and got to the point that you know that that's the first kind of milk that comes in, and it comes in before milk, also a lot of women will leak it, and that's one of the signs that they're even pregnant, um, before they have babies, and so they're like, what is that, and then they go ask the question and they learn what cholesterol moves. I knew I was pregnant two days after I got pregnant, way before you could go, because of that. were just so sore and they were leaking. I was like, what is this? Milk's not supposed to come in now, and my mom's like, that's colostrum. And then I knew the difference when my milk came in, because I was rock hard, it was extremely painful. didn't know could get rock hard, but they just like overnight milk came in, and it just was so painful. Like, have you ever had any part of your body be so swollen that you could, like it was shiny and you could just feel the pain of the swelling, just the swelling, not an injury per se, but just swelling? Yeah, my knee, but it wasn't shiny, but yeah, my knee. Yeah, so that but breasts. Terrible. Have you ever tested different price points and what are the conversion rates over those different price points? Are you late for a call?
01:00:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's okay. Well, this will be interesting because if she doesn't give us all this information that shuts the door on spending even more time on her, right?
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes, exactly. And I think that what's probably going to happen is she's going to Um, this is, this is, this is my thing is I get, and I ask a question, whatever. people like, yeah, no, never mind. I'm like, okay, that's fine.
01:01:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, yeah, I think, I think if I could go back in time, I probably would have told her, let just just pay a six thousand off our thing, pay two thousand for, for like the first, um, you know, analysis, like all it, you know, that we'll do for you. Let's go from there. And then, cause right now, um, I'm not motivated to work much for her.
01:01:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, and she's already had someone to my time. I wouldn't do it for that. I'd do it for at least four thousand. So split two, two for you, two for me. It's taken too much, like this type of thing, a new business. You have to wrap your head around a lot of stuff. And you have to wrap your head and it's the energetic exchange with a person. That is very draining. That's not just showing up and doing work.
01:01:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
New people are new exhaustion. And so she, she, sorry, go ahead.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. there's a price to pay for that is all like I'm only willing to make a certain exchange for that.
01:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah and she she has the warning signs because it's sort of like this guy I'm talking to at 5.30 today knows me from Ellen's tennis group message me and said the guy that built my funnel everything he's changing his business model so he's no longer running ads and working optimizing funnels so I'm left with out that talent is that something you can do can we talk and so boom we're talking and then right away he sends me the here's the funnel pages and I stopped running ads but if you want the conversion rates let me know so it's very like there's no energy drain like it's it's like okay let's get to it this is what I yeah yeah but without payment so just keep that in mind because it's also simple like did he pay you?
01:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know because he wants to talk about whether I do that kind of thing to help him okay okay like like just don't I wouldn't go giving away free advice whatever just I have seen people take that way very easily by starting to send you stuff and wanting you to look at it. That's taking your time. Like, I'm willing to do it on the call with you this amount of time. I'm not going to go dig into it. Your job now, if I'm talking to you is you're going to walk me through this on the call. not giving you any extra time other than the call. If we come to an arrangement on the call, then you pay me, then I'll look at it. But this calendar time I'm giving you is all I'm giving you until I know what you're going to pay.
01:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know what I mean?
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, there's just so many tire kickers, like, and you have to be careful. types of people, the funnel, you know, managers, or ones, whatever, but anyway, I just protective of you.
01:03:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. No, but you're right. Because yeah, when I was doing those free onboarding calls in Scoop Group, yeah, majority of them was bad. And I'm like, okay, why am I doing this? This is stupid. And that's why I made it five bucks a month instead of free, and you're in a min on it. And I changed it to business accelerator. or so.
01:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. My, so I know you got to go. I'm just going to do this. I have a linear path. And to me, it is get our histories, like our pedigrees basically written and figure out what we could do with our existing products. What are the ones? How quickly could we get them repurposed into a tiny little package, a small little type of offer. But then with the pedigree, and here's what we've created, are you interested in talking to us about whatever, but it's, you know, the high level price. And instead of worrying about conversions, I just trust that the right people will come into that. And in the meantime, you can do the, you know, our consulting or whatever, but then you're not committing yourself to fulfillment. When you get off the call, you're done. You don't have to think about them anymore. But at some point, one of those phone calls will probably lead to Maria, I need you. You can be like, here's the price. And I won't do the implementation. But what I can do is, lead your implementer. And I can direct your implementer potentially and say, okay, here's what you should do. And this is what it will cost you and you keep that $500 EHR in the back of your mind always. So whatever price you offer is like, okay, well, talk to you for an hour, four times a month and it's $2,000 or $2,500 or $3,000 because you know they're going to talk to you throughout the week a little bit too. And so but I'm not doing it, I will give you the strategy. I will tell your person what they need to do. I'll help you set a base cab so that we can check every week that everything's on track and you get one hour my time. That's it, $3,000, $4,000, whatever.
01:05:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, cool.
01:05:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then you get your money and then you're not burdened and then we can build the scalable stuff as it goes. Love it. Okay, I'll let you go.

It's just hanging over my painting that I have back there. You know, I still remember, um, uh, I never had to make my compass. I'm going to go up and put my water on. I boil the water on. I still remember, um, Busher Azar.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know that name? I.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Busher Azar. She's very respected. Bull persuasion.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's very bold away. She markets.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah For second anyway She used to when she first started she used to use colorful Shower curtain she bought from Amazon and have it behind her, but it worked and no one would know it was a shower curtain and you know because she's All about bold colors. It was like all like multicolored bold stuff. Anyways, it was it was funny that she just used a shower curtain I used to use My ex has been being a photographer. Well, his hobby was that he was Yeah, like those Pippers you could buy from the photography store and you just you can oh, yeah Pack it up to the top of your your wall and and it just rolls down and it's flat So that was kind of cool because you get so many colors, right?
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah Yeah I'm so sleepy. was up till like one o'clock talking to my sister and then Is she had to get up at four o'clock? So that really sucks for her. And then we got up at $5.50 to take my daughter to seminary and have been up ever since.
00:02:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how far away is the drive to the seminary?
00:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's three minutes. She starts at six o'clock. So we just zoomed out the door. Maybe I got up like $5.40 something, but yeah, I'm tired.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you got a lot done.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Congratulations. Yeah, but I hate all of it.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So bad. What do you mean, it all would talk to me?
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I hate looking at myself. I have listening and I just cringe and I think I need to throw it all away. Oh, my God.
00:02:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I feel every time I make something like that.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like, how can I do this without video?
00:02:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I just, it's terrible, but you deliver pure gold.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, but one thing that I did, I was being prayerful about it yesterday and trying to think because So everything that I do is as leveraged as it can be and price point has a lot to do with it. It's its own kind of filtration system but also a leverage in a different way. So I was thinking like, I was thinking about a lot of things. First of all, I don't like Facebook. That's where I've been for the longest time.
00:03:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have some really amazing connections and followers.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's also, and I did mention this stuff to you.
00:03:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've asked you that.
00:03:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You did.
00:03:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I I answered it just now. Yeah. I think Stan's door. I've looked at it and I think it's smart. And I also think diversifying is the way to go because I posted that first YouTube video on Saturday morning. And we'll maybe about 11 by the time posted. It took a long time for the first post because I had to do all my channel optimization and keywords and new banner and all that stuff. I've been an old 15 year old account and, you know, because I've been buying, you know, some other people's YouTube courses and stuff. What is interesting about now versus even a couple years ago, YouTube is now rewarding by video, not by channel. So before, you know, you thought you have to have this perfect channel and everything's all connected, everything, but no, now it's more like by video, get one really good video that gets lot ton of views and who cares about the other videos. So that's why I want my old channel. Anyway, you wouldn't believe it. Even the guys like, I can't believe your numbers, 90% or more is all organic coming from YouTube recommended. That's how they're finding me. But the videos got over 570 views now and I got Saturday morning, wow. And the stats, I've never ever even looked at the stats. If you ever want me to share a screen and I'll show you YouTube stats, the stats are really good at showing, like it shows you the traffic. Like I thought, okay, from my warm eyes. Facebook or I send an email out about it. No, because it shows like I only got about 20 clicks from my email because I just have a small list of 750 people. And so it actually shows like direct traffic was like 29, know, people or whatever. So it shows that level, but it shows everything else is coming from YouTube suggested. And then when I look, when people join my school, new school community, I have an auto DM because school has that feature was pretty cool. Right. And I want to confuse you because you're going go high level community. So get that out of your mind. But I then asked I'm curious, just wondering how, you know, why you joined, right? And, and some of the people that started answering since I put up the YouTube video on Saturday, said, Oh, well, the YouTube suggested you on on YouTube. Yeah. So they found me through YouTube. And they became a member, you know, and I haven't launched anything yet to them. So they also became, can we come a buyer? And then they said, I just liked your style. You're just so authentic. and inspiring.
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I thought that was really cool too. Yeah, that is awesome. Yeah, I that feels like the thing that I needed to hear, but also it's what I've been watching and it's what I've been doing. Like I am connecting with people that like connecting emotionally listening to the stories and going, you don't have even a quarter of the experience that I have, but what I appreciate you is you're out here talking and you have a real story and you're learning and you're learning faster because you've got way more resources than I ever had, but that makes me happy though, because I can see what's available to other people and like, you know what I mean, like there's all these different types of value people have. And yeah, and I love the diversity, not just of the platforms, but of the people. Like I like learning from lots of different people and that's an opportunity we didn't have before. So that means that we can be that another voice. We don't have to be that a voice. I think in the iron world everybody wants to be the voice and the teacher and the guru and the coach Whereas I don't need to be your everything. I can't just be a part of it And especially if I'm affordable enough for you to be able to get some of everyone That's you're making my brain guys.
00:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So in a I'm gonna stay in bed and and read a bit Because the YouTube channel I then do a lot of research right to go okay You know the statistically you look at someone that has certain subscribers that they have some certain videos that have way more Views of the subscriber count that you know That's a good video and he's got a topic that I also teach on and do so okay Let's model after some of this but using my authentic voice But so one guy that I've been following a bit is Dan Co.
00:07:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, for her to say have.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so he teaches about being a solopreneur, right? And it's kind of cool. I like his style and stuff. But what was interesting is that he's really big on one of his low ticket products. I think it's low ticket. I didn't click to see the price is two hour writing. So the concept is just, you know, if you can write for two hours a day, you can create a solopreneur digital, you know, income, you know, passive, almost passive income empire doing what you love if you like to write. But he's big on Twitter. So and I don't know if you're seeing a trend on this by any chance. But one of the guys that hired me for a consult call two months ago just shocked the heck out of me because he actually says he's making 50,000 a month selling is I think his high ticket products $5,000. So he has a book to call Donald. But all of his traffic is organic Twitter. That's it. Yes. And I'll. What? And he was referring to me because the guy that does the sales calls is bought some of my products and said, I think this guy needs to hire you to also make a low ticket funnel for Facebook ads. But either way, YouTube got to connect. He's got to hire you for a strategy call. So that's how we connected. But I was just like, wait, you're getting all of your traffic from Twitter. He goes, yeah, I started writing all the posts myself. And then now I hired a ghostwriter to do my tweets and all that stuff.
00:09:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And no video.
00:09:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's a book of call funnel. So it goes, no video can solve writing, right? But when you click the book, a call, it goes to a video sales letter of him saying, Hey, you know, I can help you. I honestly forget. Oh, he teaches people how to publish a book on Amazon. That's it. So the hey, like, I can help you publish book on Amazon and, you know, the typical 90 days or less or something. And so he goes through how much money you can make a typical video sales letter, and then book a call. And he's got that other guy doing sales calls. he's really a good example of leveraging, right? Obviously, he probably did it all himself at first, but then he leveraged. And there's other people now teaching people to become Twitter ghostwriters. it's our acts, I should say. So, there's something about that. And even I'm going to revive my Twitter account. I've revived my YouTube account, so I'm like, what's October? I always like to have each month a new money-making activity I'm going to try, like something different. So, October is going to be Twitter.
00:10:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I, you know what would be great is because we have such similar and parallel paths, not necessarily, right?
00:10:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're marketing.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
feel like I'm overall business, still, like the experience, also the level of work that we'll do in the organization and the structure, but I think it would be cool if we just kind of like dip our toe in the same things, okay? So, and make some like mini goals of what would you do like? So, maybe like a content schedule. I don't know how much you use chat GPT, but I love to use that for a lot of things, for planning, for ripping, for feedback, for research, whatever. what if, so, I'm going back a little bit because in the beginning, I feel like you were looking for your compass. How do you feel, where do you feel like you're at on that journey?
00:11:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like you've definitely been your fire stoked.
00:11:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Do you feel like you have, how much clarity do you feel like you have in your direction, in your purpose, in, have you set any kind of specific goals yet? think, I think it starts there. I think the bigger vision is having clarity of purpose so clear that goals automatically form themselves and they're in alignment. And it isn't ever, I think when you get really clear, it's not a destination goal ever anymore. It is a progress goal. It is a this is who I am. So my goal is to continue to improve who I am and enjoy the magic on the way. Yeah, I don't I have some specific goals, but they kind of just help me formulate a path, but they aren't end goals. They are process and progress goals, right? being able to, my mom and have have a very difficult, strange relationship, but she wants to be able to travel and have a travel van as like $50,000, whatever. I want to buy that for her or have a place where she can live with one of her kids. I'm going to be traveling. So I'm not going to have a place where she can just live with me. Yeah. I want to take care of her. I want to have a couple of rental properties, know, like I want to have investments where money is working for me. I want to continue my education forever. Like I want to stay in school pretty much forever, getting different degrees and things not for any purpose other than my own learning. I want to always be serving a mission or in service work of some sorts. And in order to do all of that, I have to be able to have some income generating activities. But I also love teaching so I always to be teaching. Those aren't specific end goals. I need to be making roughly 25. My goal is $50,000 a month because of how much taxes you get in a whole new tax bracket because I pay 10% tithing and I pay my tithing off the top. I do not pay it after taxes and expenses.
00:13:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's just off my gross.
00:13:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that amount of money means I never have to think about anything and there's tons of wiggle room for. all the people I want to hire, all those things, right?
00:14:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, within that space, I want to stay within the topics of talking about God and talking about business.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I don't, there is no more specificity than that. Now, until I go, okay, well, how does that happen? And then I've got my hourly clients. I want to have hybrid coaching. I want to have a product that just is basically their for lead gen, but also kind of nurturing people up and ascending them as they learn and they grow. And that's also my teaching outlet, my creative outlet, and my service outlet. So, it serves the money goals.
00:14:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It serves the service goals.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it has the compounding effect because as my platform increases and followers increases, that means my buying market increases, my ability to generate money off of what I already have increased. And so anyway, that's, that's my thing to me, uh, if you have a version of that where all the things feed all the things with a compounding power, that's the goal, the specificity comes in the topics and the leverage. So like the offers and things like that. As we've been going, you've been dialing into different things, but you also have a goal I just learned of trying something new and marketing every month. Yes. So what kind of thoughts, how have your thoughts evolved and all of that?
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. think, um, uh, the high level answers that haven't set down all the goals yet, but the detailed answer is. I knew the process would get me there, like I needed to get the momentum. And I feel I've got that now and I, um, sometimes get pulled. back, but not nearly as much anymore about , you know, some cost fallacy about all the assets I created for Krita and systems. But I feel so free. I love your right, like I love teaching, you know, almost, you know, became a prof, you know, did my PhD way back when, because I know I love teaching. So I sort of in my element, and I also reflected on, you know, because you said, Hey, you know, think about all your past and stuff, and you know, when I'm happy. Well, it was when I was in flow. And when I'm in flow, it's when I'm creating. So like, if I look at when I was making like millions, even sometimes million per month, you know, back between, you know, the heyday was in 2005 and 2012, probably. I was publishing a lot. I wasn't really behind the scenes ever being like 50 50 partner with a Korean doing so much stuff, you know, so being like a mechanic, you know, with launching all the funnels and stuff. But I was publishing a lot and most of like 80% of the revenue came from the digital offers because I was launching one one every month, practically. So I had like 25,000 paid customers, you know, within the four year period. Yeah. So, and then I'd make lot of money, affiliate marketing, because I love Jason Bladoon. He's a good friend of mine. And so if he was promoting building something as before, he was as famous as he is now, but he always had great product. So I would always promote and he's great at selling and converting on webinars. So I would make, I was his top affiliate for the longest time, year after year, and they paid 20,000 passively from that. So at that time, also gave, when nano cast came out, do you remember nano cast? Yeah. he gave out, you know, lifetime commissions once someone became a customer. So recurring revenue.
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So is that his?
00:17:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, no, but he used that platform.
00:17:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:17:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I didn't think it was that bad. No, no, we were using that platform. We switched from infusion software to there. And I was his first affiliate on nanocast and I use nanocast back in the day. So anyways, so I went, wow, that's it. Like I was in flow. And then yeah, sometimes I did coaching. Yeah, I remember having some fun weekends where people would fly up to my house and I'd teach them how to do a video Everyone still sucks at video. So I'd have like small groups for $3,000 I'd have like ten people five to ten people come out to my house and you're staying hotel, but each day we're in the house and we go for walks by the lake all the time and We're gonna do videos You're you're gonna walk away But the end of three days with some marketing videos for you your business, right? you're gonna be comfortable on video and it was fun and and so, yeah, I My best products back then was about teaching people consulting how to like the ultimate consulting challenge I saw in that domain and then I sold little $97 products So here's these consulting contracts when you get a client all this stuff. Oh, Yeah, so so I was kind of thinking hmm. I could easily relaunch that and tie that into recurring revenue go high level, right? Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. so build a community So this is step one because the digital offer community is is good And that's what I love too, but I've got Sally as my right-hand woman who could easily take that over when I then go Then to the ultimate consulting route, right? She becomes then kind of the chief operating officer if we will of that community And I'm talking a year out or something not like right now. Oh, I've got her plug in my phone. I'm my Computer hold on so or or, know, like you and I also you have that community I was just gonna talk. Yeah, me and and you know the only way to talk about that is We bring up the Google Doc and we you explain it to me and all that stuff. So that's there But yeah, so so but the other thought was the ultimate consulting challenge Did you people how to become a consultant and whether that be like a coach or whether that be like hangout and get local businesses for 500 bucks a month? And everything I teach will never be I'm even though I used to be like this. Oh I'm gonna make million dollars. I'm gonna teach you how to make, know, you know, tons of big money I want to just go here's how to make an extra $3,000 profit put a month. Here's not here's not make extra 500 month because I want to go after I'm still want to go after even though I'm not going to say just woman because 70% of my revenue come from men actually.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:20:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. But people in their 40s and 50s, right? Who I want to help.
00:20:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I so what I would love to do as we're both kind of direting in and stuff and and realizing that I really I really think that I and I think it's true for both of us but I really know that it would be true for me that I will go faster spending more time talking and working with you. I think that I'll stay more focused. You are working on high-level strategy and you're working every day. Yeah. Whatever. Making traction every week. Whether it's a day thing, know, you've got mom, I've got kids.
00:20:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's there's some days that are just like and some days that are like this, right?
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but especially because we both have magnetic personalities, but the emotions and authentic desire to serve people and protect them from the predatory all marketing world. I think I know that this happens for me but I think that it probably happens for you too where you just feel sincere real love for people you don't even know you just come across and you're like I just want to see you win yeah I want you to be happy like all you have to do is see their face read their story, they say something to you and you immediately feel this, mama bear love and just like you need to win. I want you to win. Come to me, yes, I'm charging money, but I want you to win and I really care about you. That doesn't exist a lot proportionately. There are more and more of those, but proportionately it's not small. But add to it, you know, our decade of experience in the marketing world. Add to it that I imagine you've never sold yourself out for your money. I haven't. That doesn't mean that there aren't times where I feel like I have definitely been taken advantage of.
00:22:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've made people a lot of money.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, you know, as a woman, meaning using feminine assets in a way, like there's a lot that we have to offer that. and others don't who have, and it's not about judging them, it's about helping protect people against feeling they've got to do things that make them uncomfortable in order to earn money or to be successful. So I would love to, like you talked about Twitter, I would love coming up with Hey, let's just say, let's encourage each other to put out X amount of content on Twitter, can be repurposed anywhere else. Writing, but I would love to create a plan of a community that we build and we feed together. I don't care if it's just women. I want to serve women with a particular way, but I don't need to serve just women. There are plenty of men who don't fit in that alpha male, who don't want to be, and they don't want to be called feminine, so they don't want to come into women's community, but they do, because that's where they feel safest. And because it hurts my heart so much that men are like, you know, like girly men or like I was a tomboy, my sister was like a tomboy and I'm like, I hate it when somebody tells me I'm in masculine energy, I get used for you, mama bear energy is not masculine. Yeah, yeah, mama bear like my wanting to go to battle and at all costs, I said, that's them and that's a mother right there. That's feminine. Anyway, but I feel like spending strategic time on the same type of things that we can then go duplicate that process out to our other businesses. So actually starting with the stuff that we do together and they go, okay, this is working with us let's go. So Maria goes and does the same thing, a Maria world and Tina does the same thing which yours is marketing, right, mine is business together. We're marketing and business and The mamas and like I mean like that could even be them. I'm a bear marketing. Oh my gosh Mama bear marketing. like that. That would be amazing. I think I've never thought of that before but yeah Actually, like that. Well, they're marketing with Maria and Tina.
00:25:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. Because like right now my goal process goals are like launched to Long-form content meaning between five and twelve minute videos on YouTube a week Include two shorts a week actually just one short is fine And then now you know that the Twitter things there. I'm like hmm. I know it's worked over, but I'm willing to start earlier because Yeah, did you ever have an old Twitter account?
00:25:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd never did anything with Twitter. I have it And but I never God, I worry, never read about followers. My LinkedIn is huge. Well, huge for me. It's like $6,000. But I've always kept my connections minimal.
00:26:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is, and I used to teach this, and I need to make video around this too, um, publish wants or sort of create once publish everywhere, which is yeah, too, right? so like what I liked about reading Dan Coe's page, about stuff is that his, um, two hour, um, you know, whatever product system he talks about how for him, he writes, that's his skills. But then he puts on Twitter and then he does a YouTube video just saying what he wrote, right? And then apparently this works. Um, and then he, um, actually, let me just share screen and take a look at that. said apparently it works. He goes and, um, then puts the tweet on Instagram and he, He now has a huge Instagram following, right?
00:27:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here's his two hour writer, right?
00:27:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's very simple. like, like, I like his, I like his vibe. Work less than one. Yeah, very nice. Join the new 1% and talks a lot about the solopreneur, right? The art of focus, one person business, talks a lot about that. Then this, the two hour writers went intrigued me.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I thought it was pretty reasonable because I think one of sounds like he has been studying my guy a lot. It's just the second brain. Like, I'd be interested if he followed Dexter at all.
00:27:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So then if you go look up and never actually look at his Instagram, but all he said is he just reposts the tweet to Instagram. And then that's really increased.
00:27:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. Do you know who Dexter Abraham is?
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, is that your guy?
00:27:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my fiance, like 10 years, but I don't know, okay. He has my note taking nerd was an old thing.
00:27:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's pretty much abandoned that now.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, he did a lot about writing. He used to take notes at all of the major events and sold it. Like I'm talking like 15 years ago.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he started that.
00:28:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like Tim Castleman doesn't now, Tim. Yes, I'm talking Tim Castleman, selling the notes to funnel hacking live or something. Yeah. Yeah, when he used to sell him from Tropic Incinversals too. But yeah, Dexter always talks about your second brain and he taught about Evernote as his second brain.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And yeah, but is he using notion?
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, or is he still use Evernote? Evernote is his second brain. he's got books and books and books stored there out of his own stuff. He's an amazing writer. Yeah. Oh, wow.
00:28:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so. I think like this, I think it's just a tweet he probably did, right? you know, so he's just doing this like like 13,000 likes. But yeah, that's all it is. It's just this. And then I've never gone to his ex account. But did you know that Google had a Google X before Twitter was an X?
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I just I'm reading a book called Alchemy. And it talked about Google X.
00:29:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, I did not know that. And you said, go ahead, go ahead. Were you reading Alchemy? No, but I do. Totally mismatch and not organized like probably Dexter does. But I use Apple Notes for lot of my notes. Well, like, I woke up this morning and I wasn't really interested to, wasn't really interested to get up.
00:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just thought, Oh, just going to. Yeah, I'm interested in getting onto this because I love it. Don't think we all know.
00:30:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So and I do like to do content stuff for an hour day easily or research, right? a lot of it's by testimonials, right? I was looking at the testimonials to our writer because this is very similar to my micro offer magic course, right? teaching me about a great small micro offer. But so I was taking screenshots of, you know, what she's saying. She's a hypnotist, mine coach to our writer, especially organized assistant art, post your content blog. But anyways, in here, oh, that's for Virginia. No, here's Dan Co. So yeah, so here's more Dan Co. So I even circled some of the stuff on his sales page. You are earning with your time instead of your mind. And I want to build a foundation to reverse that. thought, oh my God, that's so good. But the words alchemy, I did write down here somewhere that structures for social growth came, I think, from a testimonial. I wrote down to bring in, there we go, one of his clients, I went to one of his testimonial clients websites who teaches ancient alchemist principles, and I'm like, I love those words, and I just wrote it down and says that somehow I got to include that and buy stuff because I love teaching, I love, I love alchemy, like remember the, well, are you reading now, alchemy or the actually very reminiscent of a book that I read called Misbehaving by Richard Thaler, who is an economist. Yeah, I've heard of him, actually, yeah.
00:31:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, by Rory Sutherland.
00:31:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:31:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have a call just so you know at 1230. Okay. Yeah, so I, because I offer some, I'm probably stopping or probably just a group on boarding, but I offered people free on what he called when I joined my community. So someone booked for 1230 and it's actually a client. Someone was a client of mine like eight years ago. So you know, you're going to love them.
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's a pastor.
00:32:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I helped them make 30,000 a month selling angel bracelets, angel bracelets. So and and also prayers. They have an angel prayer stuff. But yeah, so I helped them. Hey, there's how you do your face. She bought my $1,000 course and she's making 30,000 was making 30,000 a month of it selling that. So they built a beautiful community. She just got sick of shipping them out because I, you know, get high quality stuff.
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, hey, design this angel bracelet in China. He didn't teach her how to like hire the people and run them a little tiny business. Well, I did because of that.
00:32:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can't. Yeah. no, no, I told her to because actually I was selling yoga braces and I was using dollar for film and dot com. I said, just ship them to dollar from the film dot com and they only charge you like, whatever. I think I was like, say dollar 50, the ship and pack and you can clue it over it. But for what are reason, they just kept sending it to their house and they were shipping it out. So yeah, I don't know what ended up happening because like, yeah, she's making like 30 thou, I have all these amazing testimonies from her. But I think also they wanted to move towards building Bill's pastor spiritual business, like a little more. So that's why I think they're coming back to me because she already wrote me and said, we want to really go big on our spiritual community now and really leverage what Bill's been teaching and stuff. anyways, that's weird.
00:33:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just thought about that that I didn't even connect the dots with you. So yeah, that's awesome. Okay, I want to make sure that you have time, but also I feel so the only thing that really slows me down literally is making videos. I can write all day long. I can stay focused. But the more that I do video, I think the more I'll get comfortable with it. But but I engage better with actual people. So if I, I can read a script. That's fine. I can do that. I still will hate it. Talking to a camera just drains my soul. It's draining to me. It does not energize me. Talking to people, like if we were to have a community and have calls and report content from there, I would get so much that I could put on a YouTube channel. could do a YouTube channel together. There's so much.
00:34:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We could even do next week have you on as a guest speaker to the new school community. I've gotten talking about time and energy management.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. I love serving and teaching. I've done podcasts. I love doing podcasts. I think it's also going to be something that we can serve other people by doing that say like, hey, that solopreneur thing is great until you can't do it on your own and you need to find a partner. Now we've got partner stories, right? I've got bad partner story. You've got maybe you don't want to say bad. Right. Yeah.
00:35:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just structured wrong. So I always got screwed financially, basically.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And so here's the, here's the warning things. Here's the way to go into it and then here's how to protect yourself and that type of thing. Yeah, we can teach people that and being women teaching that and we're not at newbies, you know, we're not spring chickens like some of these young girls coming out here being confident and I'm like, bro, you don't even know like you, you like talking out of the side of your neck excited that you haven't actually been through it yet. Yeah. Wait till you've been through it because experiencing it on a technical level and actually on an emotional level with a person you trusted it whole different thing.
00:35:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So could you open the Google Doc and just walk me through it so we can just talk about it because we, we have about 20 minutes. that work for you or did you want to achieve anything else on this call? Uh, no.
00:36:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Um, let me, I just found that. So, hold on, share and answer another question about goals.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, haven't made any big ones, but I did write down two weeks ago, I will make 100 and I have it everywhere on cards everywhere. I will make a hundred thousand dollars by October 19th.
00:36:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. Yep.
00:36:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love that.
00:36:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. So this doesn't have to be, I do want to have a ladies only event because of the men, like personal in, in person. And so that's where I was starting with this because I was wanting to do the in person thing and I work backwards. So how do I get ladies in person? I built this community that feeds them, but we can still do the ladies only invite and then basically we could funnel if we found male counterparts or you, or, or wanted to just do, um, so we could do ladies only and we could do co- when, right? So that we're serving both parts. Anyway, doesn't even have to be ladies only. It's just the thought. just want to serve women, but I can serve women and men at the same time. And so give that extra protection that women need, but also the men of the same variety would need the same thing. So that's that's good. Anyway, sorry, how to go through that. So primary goal is to gather people with affordable but not basement prices. I want to avoid the people that are looking for diet pills and lottery tickets. That's the language that I use for people who they'll spend a little bit of money, but they want miracles.
00:37:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know effort.
00:37:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically that. Build the list, establish a following on platform, found it on amazing female support, brilliant minds, giving heart. That's a path to upsell for coaching and offers. So when I thought about that, it was you and me creating content together and just talking about the different types of things in business offers is a big, big deal. Understanding how the market research and how to feed the market, you can do all the research you want to. Until you put an offer out, you don't know because you could duplicate somebody else's offer. You can't actually because you're the one promoting it. Your language will be different, your voice will be different, your energy will be different. So basically telling people how to minimum viability, teaching people about minimum viability, teaching them about duplication across networks, all that type of stuff. Anyway, what I would love to see us do is create content that leads people to it could be a free or very low cost community or free community that upsells to, hey, if you want to be on a call with us weekly, do this or if you want the ability to ask us questions, don't know, minimal time, maximum impact in terms of what we share. So you are a vault of knowledge, so am I. We can answer one person's question and it be useful to a thousand people. Yeah. So that's duplication.
00:39:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And now with AI and all the jazz, if we have a right, and this is where your skillset comes into, if we have a right VA in place, you can take what we produce, put it through a certain key or AI and then put it out on tweets, put it out like on Instagram. Obviously, I would probably just record video on YouTube because YouTube, taking snippets of recording doesn't really work so well. It's you know, you got to have the right hook and all that.
00:40:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Anyways, um, but yes is I get it You're right. We're both incredible vaults of Pure diamonds and gold and all that jazz And I think that we have slightly different take some things But also we could say the same thing and we'll express it differently Which means somebody's brain is going to receive it differently and that's great. Oh, yeah Because we get to cover more types of brains and people. Yeah, and when I want my Marketing thing that I launched about four years ago was I am possible marketing because I love Audrey Hepburn's quote You know the word impossible stands right impossible. So my podcast is called that so because I was feeling low confidence Unfortunately, I brought in you know three other partners Mia Ashley and Sally, which I shouldn't have I should have had them as I Take 80% of the revenue and hey, that's all you guys can come on as 20% because yeah They they were able to get clients from all that marketing. I was doing, and that they weren't sharing, you know, I loved how you wrote out like, hey, we figure out sharing all this stuff because then it actually goes 2500 a month. Facebook adds client, like she still has that client three years later that I hand delivered to her on civil flatter, but I would be happy if I was getting $100 a month out of it.
00:41:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So being able to create a commission structure. So if anything gets sold, yeah, our products through our emails, through our group, whatever, it's done through an affiliate link, which means you get a portion of my sales, I get a portion of your sales.
00:41:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I impossible as my baby and me and Sally put in the most time and efforts in it. And yet for Ashley, me and I still love them. so good friends. They're big where their own businesses. So like they all got clients from an exposure from it because they're shy and they would never go out and do marketing on their own like I did, but they would then be invited into teaching community. the point is to respect, I respect them a lot, but they might have different answers than I would do. But we would say that, hey, you know, me and my family. our different take on it and you know and that's okay but this is how I would do it like we'd be very upfront with our community about that too.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and so part of that responsibility would be making sure that we have excellent analytics so GA4 I've got a girl who knows that Dan knows it really well and he would easily come help us and consult to make sure that we've got great tracking yeah so that is GA4 yeah so we could track like if sales came through one of your own videos that you did we have a structure that says if this tag exists maria gets this portion if this tag exists tina gets this portion like we could be really that way we have as much protection of and there could be no feelings of bitterness and it will all be protected um so that it's uh yeah and all um anyway my brain is going a million miles an hour but but we could sort the task unless and it would it would the only us would be on both of us to be honest about how we feel. Do we feel like this task assignment is equal? Do you feel like what we're creating and contributing is equal? So if you, if I say something with confidence and you're feeling like that doesn't feel fair, but you don't tell me that's on you, you have to tell me, you have to tell me and you have to know that that's safe and that you can and that'll be okay. But if I'm lying, then you'll know sooner rather than later because you'll tell me, right? You'll see my response on my face. If my face says one thing and my tone says another thing, then you know you can't trust me and you need to pay attention to that.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and I like the idea of the back end being some kind of high level agency offer like or to them. So we get them on high level. So we make recurring because that's what's been missing for most of my business models. my exit when I was on fire, my exit in the past was software and it was very good. I could sell my shares in the software company that me and art created with my community. And I was happy, but right now I don't have that and I just don't, my age, I don't want to be 10 years later going, okay, I did not have launch to make money, but you know, we can also, if you're interested, no, we don't have to do this or anything.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't even know why I'm saying that honestly, I kind of do. I just always wanted to do something with Dan, but like, he's got basis. He's got all the analytics. He's got a team that is super invested in high level. He's great at marketing, but he will say things that like he just has no sugar coating and he has no filter. And sometimes it's obnoxious, but, but it's really good to have, I think the balance of masculine energy and also that no filter type of personality and like have him be like a small percentage and see if he even wants it. let us use. basis and your team, and you'll get 10% of whatever we create, but also if you want to have pick your brain, just show up to a call and not just pick your brain. So that's something I just talked to know I had to think about. But either way, I feel like we could come up with a content marketing plan, the tech plan, I have the skills to go set things up and I have a girl to hire to help out with high level and pay for it. So we would create a expense and we would have to approve any expenses. if I'm like, okay, I'm gonna give her 10 hours, she's $15 an hour. Do you agree with that?
00:45:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is what we should get out of it.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then that goes into something that before we get paid, we pay the expenses back. Basically write out all of the structure, how everything will go, who's got access to the finances, how the money comes in, how it gets tracked. all the things to protect it and make sure that you feel safe. I feel safe. I'm probably the same thing as you. Like, I just, I just feel safe. love people. I expect people to be kind to be good and not be dishonest and not disappear. But the reality is sometimes life happens and it's too much for people. And so we'll just make sure that we create a space so that if either of us somehow step out of character, because that would be out of character for us. Then the other person is protected. mean, like, God forbid, if something happened to one of my children, though, I don't know how I would be. I've never experienced anything like that. It just disappeared.
00:46:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then, yeah, yeah, And I know when my nephew and his friend started a, the tornado shakers company that I helped them launch buddy con company that got sold a year and a half later for over million. Oh, wow. I remember we made sure they worked in a like an exit clause for each person. So because also because they were like a third year college, like graduating, like who knows? One would just say, just going to take off to Thailand for two years. ya. You know? so yeah, it was good for them to have. And then also what's cool is that, you know, we could, if we do this right, we could create something that we know we could sell later. I still remember when Frank Kern's chief marketing officer, when I worked with him on a client together with the client hired each of us individually. And he's a brilliant guy, but I was like amazed that he was doing Facebook ads and funnels for 7500 a month flat fee, more for clients doing well already, really well, who already making probably 300,000 a month or more and want to get to a million. And he was really good at what he did and obviously had a bit of a team with him. But literally only two years later, he sold that marketing agency for millions. Like he's basically retired now. So he built that now he had the expertise like you and I have, but he built it all in two years and made it sellable. So I think he might have sold it to Grant Cardone to be honest, but because I was at the time when Frank Kern joined Frank Cardone for a while. Yeah.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. have you read the book built itself?
00:48:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't think so. might actually have bought it might be sitting on my Kindle, but I'm looking at my book shelf over there. No.
00:48:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Built to sell and even combined. Yes. Make a really good plan, but, but built to sell is specifically about building it so that your, it's not dependent upon you. It's dependent upon your offering. So even though we're creating the content as long as the content is there. So like mama bear marketing versus Tina and Maria specifically. Right. So if it's about mama bear marketing, but then we, we use our names, the brand is still mama bear marketing and we could have like.
00:49:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know like rosy rivet with the bear i made that with ai once i have to show it to you once because i that was my thing it was a mom bear but she was like rosy and she had the band and everything being do something like that so that the brand is recognizable our faces are recognizable but separately the brand has its own thing if we wanted to sell yeah i used to take my community like when i had those 25,000 paid customers like that's all meringue it out it's community right but we created the software entity called bizblis and that's what got sold out so it was always that for like i used to work in venture capital ages ago for the tennenbaum family in Toronto and a small and we take small companies merge them and then take them public so yeah definitely mom of our marketing is great i think like and we're moreable as well like yeah because you're because also we can't tie it like the community to us and stuff but is good but yeah at whatever we want to sell. So I'm just looking at my cat. She's like gonna bug me soon for feeding her. I have a cat and dogs, dogs that doggy daycare by the cats like getting antsy because I haven't fed her lunch yet. She's quite funny.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can get mad.
00:50:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She'll whack her food bowl. Like seriously. So whack the food because I kind of have a spoiler. She gets her wet food kind of in the kitchen area stuff. But her dry food. I always keep close to the bay window because you just love the bay window laying there allowing there. But she literally will look at the ball. There might be little crumbs in it and she'll just whack it off the bench. That's hilarious.
00:50:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. My, I had a beach on she died during 2020. I see would do that. She would just smack her ball and be like, what's going on here?
00:50:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. So yeah, so so I like the concept and I think, you know, if you want to add right in there mama bear marketing as the entity that's um the only thing is you know you want to serve men too I think men would still come in I almost need the day to come in be like ooh there's women you know yeah um I gotta go to name sheep and see this there yeah and I mean we have you always come up amazing ideas too like spicy CEO marketing could be it too right like because you know like um Dan co quoted someone I don't know who it was but he said you know so so many layoffs and everything happening and everyone's here for the economy thing is there's seven billion people in the world we should have with the internet and what's available on the internet we should have seven billion solopreneurs and I thought oh that's cool concept somebody has it that does not look feminine though it does not like a woman even does it I feel like that was targeted to women powered by system maybe it is So I've got to get going because I want to grab a little snack before the call or protein shake.
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well we can just sit with this, think about it, go back and forth on Onboxer and we can start to flush out a plan, start to flush out the tactical approach for making a good contract. Dan couldn't be helpful with the contract too, he would just do it because he's helpful. And I talk to him all the time. So yeah, anyway, and then if we're meeting tomorrow, then we can just keep going on that or if there's anything else that's useful, but for me, I feel like if we just did this thing together, I automatically would have like, oh I know what I want to do on my own stuff because everything that we would be doing would be applicable, it would be about marketing, packaging, offers, service. I think that it would all be duplicatable for you and for me.
00:53:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I agree. I agree. And we can even leverage the free community I'm building right now, you know? So yeah, there's lots of lots of power plays here. think there's two phases here. One is you and I both getting our legs up right now. Like for me, you know, I'm getting, you know, my legs up and like, yeah, I get my voice back. And it's then, okay, now let's let's together, we'll be like the rocket that just fuels up, right?
00:53:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah. creating structure takes a while anyway. So take it at your pace. I actually feel like I'd be better flipped around building the thing together and then taking the energy from that and doing it the other way. Because I would be doing everything with you. And then I automatically know, oh, I just now I've got muscle memory. I'm just going to go do this over here. So, but I'm good with either way.
00:53:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, I probably can do that way too. just, it's just for me, my mind gets all frazzled thinking about this year. your skill set whereas my mind right now is on creative like I'm excited to do YouTube videos a month and are sorry a week and later like yeah but yeah so let's yeah let's continue the conversation tomorrow this is cool yeah you go go take care of your um person and I'm glad that we got some this time together this morning all right see ya bye

you there? Give me a date.
00:00:07 - mark
Yeah, I'm here. What? I don't know why the update is not in my calendar.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is for me when I look at it. Let me see. Yeah, says A6. Oh, there's another line.
00:00:32 - mark
Okay.
00:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's my fault.
00:00:35 - mark
I'm so sorry.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is my fault. I'm like. All right, that's an all events. Don't need to send it.
00:00:46 - mark
Let me switch, which is weird.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just text it down. There it is. I saw your numbers. How many do we have out?
00:01:20 - mark
Five.
00:01:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alright, good morning, Dan. You have terrible audio, what did you say?
00:01:34 - mark
Yeah, I heard something of something.
00:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't blame it on me when both of us can't hear you.
00:01:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Try to be nice.
00:01:47 - mark
Why is her now?
00:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Five out. Questions and killing it right now.
00:01:59 - mark
Yeah, little disappointing. Arizona, but I'm also not hugely shocked because of how insanely hot it is there.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:02:08 - mark
Um, so just the number of people on the road is just down. Um, but with school starting, I expect that number to get back up pretty quickly.
00:02:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Let's see. Felipe monkey.
00:02:21 - mark
monkey's back should be, which is good.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Monkey's top dog so far. Yeah, and, uh, God bless Fabian.
00:02:34 - mark
That's good and, uh, blue steel quantifier, okay. One through pretty show.
00:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Quantifier what quantifies blue steel, so their cost occurs.
00:02:49 - mark
Oh, yeah.
00:02:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really good. They didn't exist until what?
00:03:04 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
H2.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:03:07 - mark
Yeah.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, but this year and we started last year.
00:03:14 - mark
Yeah. More than last year. They were just trying to generate tough cases and that hasn't gone great. Well, there are PPCs since we've been working. Yeah. When did the PPC start? Well, their numbers started coming up so they don't know. feel like it's been four months. Maybe longer.
00:03:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd have to honestly go back and look for It's been this year that's just been a massive change. Yeah.
00:04:01 - mark
But Monkey's been really pushing the California, which is good, out of their 18th tenor in California, so that's, I think, a large part of the jump there.
00:04:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do we have, in all of our Lidefar reports, one that shows us the cost per bead on average or a cost per retainer by source?
00:04:30 - mark
No, we had it at one point where it was game from the system by accounting, but count because it was taking too much time, so we don't.
00:04:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, I mean, what did they have to do for it to go into Lidefar? We only needed total numbers monthly.
00:04:53 - mark
So the numbers I can, they'd have to go in and put in the individual cost per, which became problematic. products for them because of the multiple cost per lead for source but with all the different states it was coming from a lot of different places I mean I would really like to have that quantified because that is a huge number that we need to have and you should have somebody who can do it yeah I mean every month we're looking at what our general cost is like based across the whole platform but yeah but that's that's not enough I mean that we've gone this wrap before we've done the math we've seen how different it is across sources and we've seen how much it can jump across sources so for it to be a conversation of it's too hard it is blowing my mind right now yeah I understand what you're saying and
00:06:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So what the process is, there's like valiant, let's say, or monkeys in three states, they're getting three different payments from three different entities.
00:06:12 - mark
The monkey is the worst one to look at because we just get one for monkey. Let's talk about Walker, right? We're going do the worst one to look at for real.
00:06:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:23 - mark
So the worst monkey is we get one invoice that's just paid by California. There's also a ton of return leads on that one. So well, I could tell you for monkey overall, I couldn't tell you state by state. I couldn't easily tell you state by state because I'd have to go back through each and every single lead by what state it came through, which for whatever reason isn't necessarily getting pulled over, then go back and do that against the invoices we're getting. which are semi-accurate and go from there.
00:07:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right, what you need is just those, I mean, if it's in Ritify, can be done, right? So you need to get that total, the total spend for the source. You could, well, I don't know if Tina meant this, right? You're saying, hey, we actually spent $20,000 specifically in Arizona, and we spent $60,000 specifically in California. If you wanted the true cost per source per state, true, it would be that would be the division you would do, you would do 10 into 60, 5 into 20, and then you'd a blended, the blended overall cost per source of all states. Yeah, which would be even if it's not 100% accurate, it's still better than. I don't know. I don't think what if I does that because you would have to create some sources essentially you would have to create Walker the a walker a Z walker whatever because what it does I believe is source that would be that difficult to do the data it would give us no I'm just saying if there's not there it's it's more complicated implementation than you need we need to ask Josh hey can you combine sources to get to output that last variable so that you could say hey they're blended their average cost per retainer is three divided by so let me run that by Josh because yeah yeah that's built in but that's source it's not yeah yeah And ultimately, you would want to use that, so it would be like, if they just, I don't know if you want Isaac to know this, don't know why you wouldn't care.
00:09:08 - mark
I would prefer the fewest number of people know this, because this is as close to secret stuff as you get, quite frankly, and I would really, really prefer the fewest number.
00:09:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know that this is why we have code names, because Mark does not want people to be able to leave and say, is happening.
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:09:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So then, I'll ask Josh if there's a way to API that in from like a G sheet to the bookkeeping would go fill in the blanks and then it would suck it in. Now, then the other question is, they would have to enter this when, right? So they'd have to enter it up to the beginning. That's the other thing. It's not going to be totally accurate necessarily. Do you pre pay? You pre pay everyone? almost pre-paid right?
00:10:02 - mark
Most of this is pre-paid.
00:10:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so it works in that respect so they could populate it.
00:10:09 - mark
No, it makes it worse because if you look at the end of the month, like, you're getting 200 grand.
00:10:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you'd have to then do another cost. You'd have to say this amount of money is for this period of time. I don't think what of us is to do that.
00:10:30 - mark
But working it even in other ways, you know a cost per lead for some of these. Some of these are just a monthly fee. The issue with that is you couldn't just tie it to the number of leads because of the amount of returns.
00:10:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what I think that we would need to do and I'm going to restate that this is a massive metric in terms of how your business is going and it needs to be a track. So let's just figure out and agree that we're going. to figure out the best system for it and that it's going to be work, but it's going to be worth it. A combination of whatever kind of data your financial team can give you, accounting, with what kind of reports we could export and litify, dump into a spreadsheet. I'll do it. If that's what it takes, I don't care.
00:11:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And then we can use AI to help us. What? All right. Sweet.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to forget. I'm going to forget. Let me finish. Go use AI to to figure out some calculations and help us improve the process. So we can figure out some kind of data dump process whether it's using a combination of an export, which I think is what we would have to do. Export reports from accounting, export reports from solidify, potentially tweak the reports that we get from either source into a spreadsheet where we can then create some additional formulas and then, if necessary or helpful, get AI in there to help us make some calculations, but we've got to be tracking this.
00:12:29 - mark
I think I can give you a rough idea at the end of every month because once everything gets into the system, which takes like a week past the end of the month, right, so like obviously of all the July, August isn't done yet. I'll be able to pull that fairly easily. At least it's a flashlight in a dark alley, right? It won't show us everything that you want to see, but at least like kind of points in the right direction.
00:13:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so I'm going to mid-month, or Monday the 14th. How do I do this? I need to set up a reminder and make sure that that happens. Actually, you know what, I'm steezy. you Okay, so what was your process be, how do we go from that's a pain in the butt and can't do it to you you could probably do it once a month because once I'm on my idea of it is what we came to but it's not exact so it's here's at least a flashlight but it's not it's not a report and litify that we can really run that's the difference yeah but to be clear that's never a prerequisite for me I know we don't like doing all the data and the work but we also have very clearly received the benefits of doing that. And including, you know, it keeping you from not cutting off Washington. Can you imagine where you'd be right now if you'd actually like quit Washington, like you were planning on?
00:15:12 - mark
Those are headaches.
00:15:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have 26 retainers.
00:15:16 - mark
Is that really the answer? Maybe.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:15:21 - mark
Well, it's good. It's good. Let just say it keeps her in those cases, and we're trying to make more and more providers, which should make things better up there.
00:15:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you were just stuck his head back in here today. Less headaches. This is this is the business that you have. I'm I'm. I don't know what to even do with that. Are you are you. I mean, do you want to quantify that? Was that just flipping and disregarded or.
00:15:55 - mark
Flipping and disregarded me just being annoyed by the bark.
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:01 - mark
So we got a response to the New Mexico one in six days, which is insanely fast. So we finally submitted on Samantha's New Mexico bar complaint.
00:16:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh.
00:16:15 - mark
And the New Mexico bar, like, responded within six days, which is. Stockingly quick. Um, but they, they just missed it.
00:16:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No worries. No, it was a first letter.
00:16:28 - mark
They feel like, Hey, if you missed another text message, like, where are you opening up this one? It's gonna be bad. But I think part of the reason they do that is a copy gets into the client. So it looked like they're taking it more seriously. Got it. Got it. I'm annoyed at the entire situation. I'm still waiting for the Washington one to come back. That one's stressing me out.
00:16:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I don't remember hearing about these. remember the Nevada death case one, but what is the Washington.
00:17:00 - mark
Um, Sam screwed up on a case we got some doubt on and we didn't send them a check that we had. I mean, client wasn't harmed overall, but they had sent us one letter like November and she just missed it for whatever reason. They never called in every mail and then everything else and they had their client do a bar complaint rather than just, you know, picking up the phone and calling us or emailing us or anything else.
00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, secondly, we did something wrong, so I don't want to blame them completely because we are in the wrong, but it was really small, did something.
00:17:35 - mark
Alright. we changed our systems, changed our processes to make sure that doesn't happen again, which good.
00:17:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:17:44 - mark
And then we got another one to review over the weekend from a client from 2020 who asked for a couple of their file in 2022 and left the Yelp review saying that I stole their money. Wow, I think we're just going to start I'm aside a budget to start doing these people, not because I think I'm going to get any money from them, but so I can always get injunctive relief to send the Yelp or Google to try to make them take down the review. She's a large waste of money in time, but I'm getting a little pissed off.
00:18:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Quantify, like, how much money are you talking about needing to invest in that?
00:18:26 - mark
Probably five to eight grand for each time for lawsuits. I mean, it's cheaper to try to probably hire the companies to get it taken down, which may be a part this, I think, as well as I want to see what Yelp or Google's going to do because there may actually be a class action lawsuit against them. The problem is professionals, like doctors and lawyers, cannot accurately respond to these reviews. Due to either in our case, term in client privilege or patient time for doctors, and it's incredibly Pardon some and there's not a mechanism for us to dispute the validity of these reviews in a fair way of say a restaurant or a plumber So we want to actually go down that path to show that they don't have a good mechanism to do this and then go from there That's the other this question I think Yeah, okay, so now I understand your stress.
00:19:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should probably just start by taking and temperature calls like When we get on the calls, I know what you can handle that day No, it's good.
00:19:45 - mark
mean, I'm trying to push the team to get over a hundred Incidences this month, and I think even where we've been for them. It's possible. Although I'm not Spending anything more than what I've already spent on the marketing, so It may or may not slow down. just want to make sure we stick within our budget. So yeah, but we'll leave through the air so it should happen.
00:20:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's probably possible. We're also going to Labor Day, but we're at right now. It's right there. That'd be fun.
00:20:18 - mark
I would not be bad. No, so we'll push that and they'll be excited for that.
00:20:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's Ronin?
00:20:25 - mark
Today Ronin should be in the office. Ronin got his balls chopped off, so he's not allowed to go anywhere. baby! Yeah, so hopefully he gets his cone off, but yeah.
00:20:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Ronin's been heavily medicated the last week. Oh, I think you should just go like snuggle with him for a while later, not what I think.
00:20:49 - mark
Yeah, no, we got a lot of work we got to do here, but that's okay. Last week of the month, so teams need a little bit more work to hit their goals, but they're we were roughly on track, so.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just a little perspective, harder you drive and the bigger you get, the more these types of things you're going to have. perspective is everything and taking a deep breath and just that's the cost of business. Just tell yourself that because you clearly stressed out, the energy is very different.
00:21:26 - mark
It pisses me off when people accuse me of stealing from them when I know how hard we do.
00:21:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get it. Yeah. Yes.
00:21:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So, they're stealing my jewelry right now, Mark.
00:21:38 - mark
How do you leave that? Your jewelry doesn't have a lot of value.
00:21:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a good point.
00:21:43 - mark
What does it say?
00:21:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Boy.
00:21:45 - mark
That's a good point.
00:21:46 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:21:47 - mark
Keep standing in the car and then I'll be happy.
00:21:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
This is true.
00:21:52 - mark
This is I'm to give my good beer.
00:21:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm going to get guitar in my sights.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Guitar, golf cart, and beach time. and Disney movies and her kids and she'll be okay. Oh my god, I'm gonna cry right now.
00:22:07 - mark
Yeah. So like, I get it. I know how to, yeah, anyway.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, fine.
00:22:13 - mark
I just wasn't prepared for grumpy mark. My kind department is constantly complaining nonstop and they drive me nuts, but there is only like two and a half of that. So given the size we are, it's actually fairly impressive how much they get done for two and a half people. Okay, we're doing the lean distributions.
00:22:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there anything that you can do to help that out because burnouts are real thing and what happens if you lose somebody?
00:22:44 - mark
We're boning some out decently and they're not overwhelmed yet. So the issue is it's not a money making area. It's working. So I hesitate to add more resources to it when it's just had.
00:23:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's let's let's talk about this. It may not be money generating, but it's money protecting and money managing.
00:23:08 - mark
Yes.
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which is valuable. And if you think that it's not a risk, but they're complaining all the time, I would say you.
00:23:16 - mark
It's the person. It's the person who leads it just complains all the time. She's just a negative person.
00:23:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:23 - mark
It's just who it is.
00:23:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need you to be more clear with your words and saying that the planning department is complaining than eight.
00:23:30 - mark
My CFO is a pain in the STD with and if she wasn't so good at her actual job and I wasn't worried in any way she performed that any money was getting stolen or something was happening, she would not be here.
00:23:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:23:42 - mark
So that's.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's trade off that I make. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you for that full perspective. As long as you you know what you're doing and it's not very merry to go out of their way to with me from time to time, which is great.
00:24:00 - mark
Yeah, if they need doggies, um, no, I think they just make some help to do that.
00:24:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Um, yeah. So when you get worked out and stressed out like this, do you go do anything physical, like walk or just anything to get this audio body?
00:24:21 - mark
Yeah, they're walking like five to eight miles a day. So that's. Yeah. Um, circles around the neighborhood or on the office. It's only like five to nine miles.
00:24:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not that bad. It's not that bad. Mark, what does our day look like? It's been a while since we've looked at that.
00:24:45 - mark
Just.
00:24:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:24:48 - mark
Yeah.
00:24:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
There's of steps.
00:24:51 - mark
Look, if I'm going to be on the phone, I might as well be out, like walking and be on the phone and just sitting there.
00:24:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree. It's so much better for you physically and mentally, but tell me about.
00:25:00 - mark
your day. Still get up super early, although 5'3", instead of 5 am. Get up. Usually, now I'm walking for the first hour, hour and a half, because it's nice and quiet. So I can think about whatever I need to get done for the day, do my meditation. Then, around 7", start getting ready for the day, so I'll jump on the computer, handle whatever I need to handle. I can go shower, get ready for work, be in the office before 8", generally speaking. During the day, depends on which day, but business stuff, I guess for lack of better term. lot more meetings in the evenings and on weekends, so like the next 8 weeks is straight, like there's something every weekend, so just a lot more events. But if I go really late or too hard the night before, instead of trying to force myself to wake up early, I might sleep until 7, so I'm not burning myself out as much. So it's a little more doable, and let's put myself through the gratter quite frankly.
00:26:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm actually impressed, that's good.
00:26:22 - mark
Try and do more things, try to spend more time with people outside of, like, law.
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:29 - mark
So that's good. Like, was it not this past week in the week before I went to Vegas with friends, and I learned to play bakarot. That was fun.
00:26:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, nice.
00:26:40 - mark
Yeah. And I won, so, extra nice.
00:26:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. How often do you think you see people just, like, outside of work?
00:26:51 - mark
I'm trying at least once a week.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome.
00:26:55 - mark
So, yeah.
00:26:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Did you go to Foo Fighters?
00:26:59 - mark
Where are supposed to go to Foo Fighters? I did not go to Foo Fighters. I did not end up going to that one.
00:27:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Um, but I'm seeing Green Day instead.
00:27:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that should be pretty good.
00:27:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
seeing Jelly Roll as I understand his name. Well, standing.
00:27:22 - mark
Country artist.
00:27:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, no, I understand. But he's not that great. Okay.
00:27:29 - mark
He's okay.
00:27:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's consumed Jelly Rolls that much.
00:27:33 - mark
Yeah. His exercises are free to rest and kind of amazing. Do you feel like he needs some inspiration?
00:27:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, I know. It's hilarious. It's like, I'm this loser, that guy, alcoholic. You're like, okay, you got me.
00:27:49 - mark
Yeah, yeah, fair enough. Oh my gosh. He's third. Like the rear view is smaller than the front windshield for a reason. Well, it's in front of you's brother. What's behind you? some poetic about a 49 year old man who's when he rooked you the year and whatever else. So, yeah.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I just got a very book cover thing from Dan.
00:28:13 - mark
Yeah, that's fair.
00:28:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, well, that's.
00:28:20 - mark
And you know the question keeps coming up of like how far are we pushing this thing?
00:28:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's next?
00:28:27 - mark
How many more states and I don't get an answer, but by the end of next month, I'll be sworn into both Colorado and New Mexico.
00:28:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Obviously New Mexico is going, but. Questions coming from who? You.
00:28:43 - mark
Uh, no, asking like we had a. Okay. I was wondering. Really event like Saturday and so it's always like what else are you adding? else are you doing? Because. Got you. More lawyers are getting out of California, not getting out, but adding other states to what they do. I think by the end of the month, New Mexico, so New Mexico doesn't change anything off basically, but yeah. And we're just waiting on some more parts of some through some of other states, so.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how much time do you think that you're working right now? Every day.
00:29:21 - mark
Physically in the office are mental times spent because those are vastly different numbers.
00:29:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd actually like them both.
00:29:27 - mark
Physically in the office, I'm probably. Not much more than 40 hours. Usually invite an out by five or six. Okay. Mentally, I don't even know how to be in quantifying it. My main focus, so a lot. Pretty much always.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And also time.
00:29:51 - mark
It's not about mine is about someone else's, but yeah.
00:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's, that's the thing. So, um. How much of it do you think goes to other people's businesses or like the dog charity? What is that called?
00:30:11 - mark
The Muddy Hearts thing, the yeah the dog food idea thing. Not a lot's been spent on a dog food thing yet because they need to make money first before I can do that. So yeah, it's a long thing. Basically as a way to offset income, we can donate things so it's charitable deduction. Directing part of that charitable deduction in that charity to do what I want since I'm giving them basically items to sell so that way they make money and part of that going to a scholarship for one of the surgeons from Japan who's now going to UC Davis to study dog nutrition. So she'd be the only person in the world who's both a repair expert and dog nutritionist who then take it to the next logical step, you know, totally logical, creating custom blended dog food with Chinese herbs and obviously high quality ingredients that separates it out from say a farmer's dog or just food for dogs or all these or whatever you have, even though people are now more comfortable paying more for dog food, but this would be customized to each and every, you know, owner. So it would be, you know, four or five year plan of it.
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
A food is customized to the dog, right?
00:31:39 - mark
Because depending on what their medical issues are and needs that they would talk to the doctor. And there's a subscription, and if you for it, there's definitely a market for that.
00:31:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, for sure.
00:31:58 - mark
This is just not a mass market. or wouldn't be at that point and I'm fine with that, but yeah, you have any idea what the market size is? No Yeah, ginormous It's enough. mean looking at who's already doing it that there's clearly a use and a need and I mean Even looking at the number of dogs getting surgeries is Increasing the number of the amount that people are paying for their pets is to increase and there's going to be a large segment of the population that doesn't Do this, you know doesn't want to do this like dogs just an animal to them and that's fine, right?
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, that's not the target market Right I'm sorry.
00:32:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, jenny and i just dropped a grip What? jenny and that eric dropped a grip on their dog when the dog was sick and then yeah, they're a current dog Like it's it's some sort of I don't know if the food's custom, but it is not store bought or if it is store bought it's like specialty store or bought like your mic or whatever it is. I was over there the other day, I'm like, that smells good.
00:33:06 - mark
Right. So I got to go, I got to go, I'm hungry.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does it mean? I dropped a grip. I have never heard that before.
00:33:16 - mark
Up in the cash, yeah.
00:33:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's what I guess that made sense, but like never heard that before.
00:33:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:33:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not a Californian, though. I mean, I was born.
00:33:28 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
But what's also funny is Jenny has helped blow up a dog food treat company in Australia. And they want to come to America, but they can't because they cannot get like the import blah, blah, because it's all, it's all like a kangaroo and what it's like, Australia meets like the president leftovers. But I mean, they're, she's helped them scale to like, into doing four million a year now just in Australia.
00:34:04 - mark
Okay, so it looks like we've experienced projects apparently in the future, right? Dan and I are going to have multiple projects in the future from that, the doctor software stuff, but yeah, this is more a passion project that, you know, obviously I wanted to try to make money, but even if we turn this into just in general non-profit, it doesn't mean you can't get paid off it, but you know, profits are necessarily the end goal, I'm okay with that as well.
00:34:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, Dan's the king of letting you know that an entire business can simply function as a tax shelter and still be really profitable that way. Correct.
00:34:39 - mark
So, you know, I didn't see where it's coming out, but first things first, I got to make enough to support this thing on my own and get the fuel through veterinary school and whatnot.
00:34:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I got a year to figure out that. Okay. mean, and just so that I kind of understand you currently better. How much time do you think you do spend on other people's businesses that you're not, you know, directly benefiting from in terms of depends on week to week.
00:35:14 - mark
Like, it really just depends. Like, we went out to a dinner, I don't know, like, three weeks ago with one of nurse's friends. And he took over this company that does custom trucks, like, utilities and whatnot. Because just by basically a flatbread, you've got to build all these custom cherry pickers and everything else to go on it. And, you know, he's trying to figure out how to make the business run because he just took it over. And so he said to Darren, because he wanted to pick my brain because, yeah.
00:35:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was knowing about that.
00:35:48 - mark
Dan has like, you know, where people are like, you're smart and you figure things out.
00:35:51 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So I want to pick your brain, even though you don't know about this specific issue.
00:35:55 - mark
Like, business is business. so like part of discussion we had was like his general manager, like. And Bessel's from the company before he saw that, and now he's but hurt because he's getting pushed to the side and he gets he has to buy the business and whatever else. so, you know, questions that you've asked me before, like, okay, well, how much would you pay to like replace this person? And X, Y, Z, so, you know, stuff like that we spend time with, but like, it's not that I don't enjoy it. Like, that's interesting to talk about and do, but, you know, you're asking how much time some of this stuff takes.
00:36:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, I mean, really, it's also about what does that time do for you? So if that is something that's draining to you, I would know. Okay. And I wouldn't imagine that. I think that you like it. It lights up your brain, the marketing side of thing or just the problem solving, which is. puzzles, me too. Somebody presents a puzzle on like, how fast can I fix this? what can I do? Like, what kind of impact can I make that kind of thing? So just. But really, the other thing is making sure that you are purposely putting in time that is rejuvenating to you or energy increasing stress relieving that type of thing.
00:37:15 - mark
So the walking is good. You know, because it's the same thing, things are just not happening fast enough, which is just always going to make constant even in my life.
00:37:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Pace matters, you are a human being, and you know, they never did tell Dan about the dog food thing.
00:37:36 - mark
Yeah, anyway, I just realized that.
00:37:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, hold on a second. So we were talking about setting up scheduling for the medical office.
00:37:56 - mark
Yeah, so it's going to take some time. She's going to figure out. what they have and what they don't, but it doesn't sound like they have a heck of a lot set up, which is fine. So we'll work it through, but I was hoping for a little more stuff from the doctor's office, but doesn't sound like want get a lot. So I just want to some time recreating the stuff, which I'm going to also use as teaching opportunities when they're in office of what's good records and bad records and how things work together. So it's not just for Jonah, it's also, you know, partially for us and training exercises. And when doctors ask, you know, hey, what are you looking for? What do you expect? Now we have semi-templist, so we can give them a look.
00:38:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what an ideal record looks like. So I know this is going to shock you, but information is incredibly valuable. And most people don't organize it, don't look at it. It's chaos. They just get in and they root force through. things, nothing is optimized, nothing is leveraged. So in terms of my number one tactic to everything is questions, obviously, right? Much of our conversation is question question question. But for you, for anywhere you want to go and anything that you want to do, that's the same thing. But what the really interesting thing is, is that I don't need to answer most of the questions. I mean, I come up with ideas and do have some answers, but a lot of it is answered by the people I'm asking the questions to. the biggest thing is they're not asking themselves that question or forcing an answer. So if I ask a question, there's an expectation that I answer, right? Sometimes we have questions in our minds and we're faced with something and we're like, push that aside, moving on, and we just allow ourselves to not follow that train of thought through. So in terms of Just knowing that really being constantly conscious of that assume most people Don't have the structure that is that they need that is benefiting them well So if there's anywhere you want to go into and let's say you've got a reason why their success matters So if you want Chona to be working and and have job stability Also, not be stressed out because chaos is stressful to everybody who works in it. Sure There's a lot that you can do to help her create an environment of success and it's just feeding her questions Ask this question by miss out and and the pace has to be because because people that don't want to answer things Definitely don't want to answer five things or ten things Right, so you just ask one question and you slowly get that answer and you Plug that into something and then you ask the next question and get that answer and plug it into something So then making sure that the questions are asked in a strategic way of you know, what's the foundational question? What's the biggest one I need to know this before I know everything else or I need to know this to inform the other questions and so on. But also bringing that back to any solution that you might want to create and present and sell to people and this would work for down with basis to is what is the biggest thing that makes an impact what's the biggest lever for them, which is going to be informed by data. And then what's the simplest lever that you can create for them that gives them that impact so if it's they don't know where most of their stuff is coming up. Okay, or if so I'll give you an example with July medical. I looked at his numbers and he was telling me that he's looking at how many follow up visits he has. And I looked at the total number of incoming visit or the total number of initials and he didn't track follow-ups but he did track total visits and because total visits was hardly any higher than initial visits is very clear that follow-ups are almost non-existent.
00:42:18 - mark
There's not a lot of them. Correct.
00:42:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So then the leverage point is how do we create more of those and we brainstorm that within the five-minute session very quickly and but a lot of these types of things, these questions can be written out and created, you can build a system for them. So anyway, just something to think about in terms of wherever you're spending your time and business, the questions being around, leverage data and information, wherever you're trying to get, you'll get there the fastest by using those to kind of thoughts, processes, measurement systems, whatever. or you want to call it.
00:43:01 - mark
Anyway, okay, setting up the office in terms communication and one thing that we have not been consistent with and we keep stopping and starting and stopping and starting is email campaigns. know, we have insanely huge database of people at this point and we are really not mining that as hard as we could.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what value does that have for you? what do you anticipate you're you're missing out on it in terms of an email campaign?
00:43:40 - mark
So, to me, it's always just being top of mind, right? email campaigns, I mean, this is more damn thing than mine. You know, I don't know what necessary to expect in terms of outcome, but there's a lot of people who have been in car accidents, who may have taken certain drugs, so there might be mass tortures. stuff where they get hurt at work, which is worker comp, where they bought new car that doesn't work, there's lemon law, there's a lot of other areas of law other than just car collision to potentially reach out to. so trying to establish ourselves of, hey, where you're going to law firm, you have a problem you call us, and if we can't help you, we'll point you in the direction of someone who can. Okay, because I mean, we have tens of thousands of emails at this point. Traditionally, our open rates have been extremely low. So we're not doing it right.
00:44:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're not doing it the right way. Well, there's a lot that goes into it. So a quick summary is, first of all, you have to have a really good email hygiene list hygiene. So I don't know how much you use of it, but I'm just going to how much you know about it, but it goes not very frankly, but so things can happen where like let's say somebody's not using the same email anymore. And let's say it's a Gmail account and they don't use it anymore. So that turns into what's called a spam trap. They don't cancel the account. What they do is they use it to know that if anybody's sending it, they're sending it to a retired account. So they clearly don't have a good relationship. You automatically get deemed. So you need to have a system where you're automatically cleaning the list for people who don't open or click during a certain time period. And then what you do is you put them into a reactivation campaign, which is basically kind of clickbaity and like trying to get them to open it up like is this goodbye blah blah blah that type of thing. And if they don't respond to your reactivation campaign, you completely delete the email. You get read of it. You never email it again because by emailing it, you could be risking your sender score. Which is the thing that decides whether not you even get to the email address and whether you get put in junk or spam Or or the inbox or whatever That's one aspect of it So you you have to have somebody who knows how that works and all the components that go into it And it has to be managed and reviewed constantly The then the other thing is what do you send out how often do you send it? Do you send it as a broadcast or do you send it as a Sequence and broadcast Dan will tell you will hurt you Sequences are are much better for you and then it's what is the content and then there's lit testing the The headlines the content whatever, but essentially what you'd want to do is come up with a campaign That's probably 90 days like a quarterly cycle where you send them different types of information and like I did you know or whatever type of thing and You'd have to play around and find out that the frequency like what impacts your unsubscribe rate because you're not giving them something that they're going to be like so excited to open or is there something where you could actually be giving them something they're excited to open so finding the timing and then basically you would end up creating a campaign for a certain amount of period that your data has told you is going to be useful for you and then you just recycle it every 90 days and so a person one particular person so it's not set by like days of the year right but it's a 90-day cycle that a person goes through and day one day two whatever you're not going to send that many emails because that I don't imagine that's going to be good for the business that you have but let's say it's once a week or you know once every few days and so then they go through the whole 90 days or maybe at 60 days and it's just this kind of information and the goal is to get them to either keep open not subscribe or tell you hey I've got a problem but we don't know the statistics of how long a person will go before there's some type of incident where they've got something to make referral to you so because of the nature of your business you would want to do some sort of infotainment right which is we're teaching you about all these different things but also maybe we're embedding some other type of information that's useful to you that's maybe not accident specific but it makes you keep engaging with us because the odds are it's probably going to be a year or two when you have some other type of accident where you're going to come here and I want you to stay on my email list for that year or two so how do I get you to keep opening it you know because you don't have a super easy like you you don't have a new set of twos that are going on today right now um so there are a lot of class actions are like hey you might be well you might be entitled to money for xyz right right so but The hook is you've got to get them to interact. They have to at least open your emails or your sender score starts dropping rapidly. So figuring out what that is, and that's, it's a big strategy game, but dipping your toe in once in a while, you might as well never do it because you could end up hitting a spam trap and just making sure that nothing you do is worth any of your effort and time, it's just waste of time and waste of money. So either be very strategic about it, don't do it at all.
00:49:31 - mark
Yeah. Yeah, I know. We need to go this the right way because we haven't so far. So I would definitely want to focus on what we can do to make this better.
00:49:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Just ask Josh. His answer is going to be don't do it in a little fine.
00:49:52 - mark
I'm pretty sure.
00:49:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah.
00:49:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but aren't you guys, you have stuff in high school?
00:50:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Level for your texting stuff, so I wouldn't use high-level. I'm pro use active campaign. Yeah Yeah, well, I gotta I gotta time send a Bobby esque The dude's name who I can't even ever answers my emails, but he has I think He's got the software that does the Like it'll Acclings your list on the way in so you instantly know good bad and different and then It literally is that but he has an integration no one else has an integration so his software hooks into clean 13 and then like auto tags people in Definitely doesn't even fusion self, but I want to say it doesn't enact a campaign But I can't remember what I'm setting up on So I'm either going to confirm that or not But active campaign would be the one I would use because we have so much of that stuff built or templatized. And then you would just have to figure out, you know, you could load up the old people, run them through clean, run them through his software, do an initial list clean, and then you would come up with the strategic degree.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then you would have other way around, because if you don't have a good strategy that makes sense that you think you could be opening up your emails and not unsubscribing constantly, like if you if you can't come up with something that you could send that's valuable enough to keep people engaged for a year or two until they like have an accident come up, that makes any sort of mathematical sense, I wouldn't need a lot of clean emails.
00:51:52 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, you clean them just to see what what does that even look like, right? you get a bunch of bad emails? Like it shouldn't be that so many emails die in Mark's scenario because this relationship is so different than like a list. So yeah, it would cost nothing. It would cost like a dollar bucks. But then you could, you'd have, but you'd have it all hooked up to active campaign already. So it all did all that thing, all those things. And you can make sure, okay, these automations are working and whatnot. But yeah, yeah, you don't necessarily do that until the strategic is in place. you're like, okay, we're going to do this thing. Let's clean it. Because you would. And then you'd use the current good list to start getting something. Or maybe you then he has this other thing. Again, it's part of active campaign where he has like a warm up thing where you send them. And then it does all of this. I can't do the word, like basically activity tagging, but then it starts to say, hey, this person's been not being in, hasn't opened, hadn't clicked, hasn't done whatever, and then it starts to sort of clean the list over time, so you're spending an email a month, which is probably the scenario here, you figure you'd send an email a month, and then you'd have these Rando, like Mark said, this drug, that drug, check out my dog food, and then the, but those would get factored into this sort of self-haging thing. It works really well. mean, the Stute stuff totally brought our list back to life, even though I don't think we're going to get sales from it, but statistically it looks great.
00:53:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, look, to at least just trying to say, stop the mind, right?
00:53:51 - mark
Because like you're saying, it's a brand for you, yeah, and that's the biggest issue is it's just such an unknown of when you'll need it. First, you know, shoes or clothes or whatever else where it's more, maybe, maybe not.
00:54:07 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you should be mailing like weekly or every other week. I don't think once a month is enough to be top of mind or to get good inbox placement. You want to be able to be recognizable. So that's something if you have any like you find yourself thinking about it, then you would think about how would you come up with strategy? Would you delegate that to somebody, hire somebody for that, or would you try to come up with it yourself? But either way, you need some sort of initial framework to review and say, does this make sense? And then also you would want to see if you could find any evidence that anyone else is doing that. Just maybe they're not, maybe they are and you don't want to do things just because other people are because that's how innovation starts, Nobody else is doing it.
00:54:56 - mark
The ones that tend to get familiar with all of these are not great. But frankly, no, through one, that's like half decent, which is like, you may be entitled to XYZ.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm just saying to draw from inspiration to see if there's anything that can help kind of do the mental, have you lifting up? I could do this, I could implement this. And like, Dan, know, he was talking about dog food, it doesn't always have to be any one particular thing. I don't so. But you know, you have access to, you can monetize, well, why would Tweetlon mail me about this? I don't know, because I'm our Tweet and I love dogs. And you know, I want to tell you about my pet project because CEOs send out emails of, you know, this is a foundation I'm involved in that has this not related to the company. So that's not unheard of. Anyway, but you would need a whole plan of how do I maintain a relationship with you? What is that free? frequency look like, what is the value that I can bring to you so that I can stay top of mind. And it's possibly relative to you in your life. And it's enough that you don't want to unsubscribe so that when you do have an accident of this sort, or you feel like I'm informing you, I'm teaching about something, whatever. Anyway, and then you just recycle the content and then you go through the activation. So maybe somebody realizes, hey, I've seen this stuff before. It's the same exact thing. Most people aren't going to notice that, or if they do unsubscribe, but it's more that you'll either find a way to keep a relationship that want to keep it, and they won't care that it's recycled because everybody knows repetition keeps it in your brain and they're like, oh yeah, thanks for reminding me that kind of thing, or that I get out of my email. So either way, you want them to make a decision. Either I like Mark and I'm going keep reading it, or I don't like unsubscribe. Either way, it serves you because you're not having useless emails on your list, and the people that do want to keep listening to you, they're okay with whatever simple things you want to remind them as long as you're making sure that you bring the value. So anyway, there's stuff to think about there. Nowhere almost at time, high level, hip compliant version, any movement on just that conversation, Dan?
00:57:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I already know that's a black.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's too big of a question for right now. What would we do with that altogether?
00:57:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's just required in that scenario. So it just adds some layer of privacy to the whole kicking a little.
00:57:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Josh, why don't you know how we are with reports? We already took up the whole call and can't get into that, but can we next week just kind of go look at everything again and think about what we need to know, can we measure it and is it accurate because that was one of the things as we look at it, like the DD matters, the actual attorney fees were not correct and I don't know if they are now, so if we can just go over the reports with a fine tooth comb next week and know it's super good question.
00:58:33 - mark
So Monday next week is Labor Day. I don't have a problem, but I want to make sure you guys are okay.
00:58:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All my other meetings will probably cancel. Thanks to you bringing that up right now and me telling everyone we should cancel our meeting.
00:58:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, I can make this one.
00:58:49 - mark
Thanks, Mark.
00:58:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect. You're welcome. I'm already meeting with Fuji and yeah, I was just expecting because you guys are you usually up for the holidays and we'll be back from our trip. Sunday, so yes. Okay, so everybody's coming here next week. We're good.
00:59:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so then can we spend some time unless something big comes up? Can we just really dig into the reports and validate them and make sure that they're accurate and then give Josh that feedback?
00:59:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah. And then the other thing I'm going to, so I guess Isaac's going through the literature, the Salesforce course, which is great. But like a perfect example is, yeah, he did some . He's like, we can do this. I'm like, yes, let's do that. Like the email that marks sentence, like, that shouldn't be a thing anymore. Right. That should be automated. That should just be an automated thing or it's a dashboard and say, we just look at it.
00:59:53 - mark
It is.
00:59:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's in there.
00:59:57 - mark
The reason I said it is because I haven't converted yet.
00:59:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So instead of us going. back and forth and looking.
01:00:01 - mark
All these things are in there. I'm just adding the sign to the image over to your C other.
01:00:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Got it.
01:00:13 - mark
So, are you guys of convenience, but these reports are already there.
01:00:17 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sweet.
01:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's all I have for now.
01:00:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, cool. gonna get my haircut. I'm sure you guys wanted to know that.
01:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bye. Take care of yourself, you guys.
01:00:32 - mark
I'm gonna talk to you about the other thing real close. You're able to put it.
01:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't need them forward though. Bye then.
01:00:39 - mark
Get your haircut. Here you are.
01:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want to turn off the note? Take her though. Where? Hold on one sec. Yes. How do I make it leave? I'm not about to do that before. Remove. You

Hello.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hello.
00:00:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's up?
00:00:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not my energy levels because I've been getting up at 5.30 in the morning for the last couple days because I have a seminary student now.
00:00:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You have a what? Seminary. oh, oh. I thought you said something about a son. I'm like, wait, what? have a son in love. I thought you were going to say to jump into your ice bath and then expose yourself to sunlight.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you're not.
00:00:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Never. You're not doing that.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm using myself.
00:00:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no.
00:00:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I was like, wait a minute. Never no matter how many times that should tell me it would be good for me and a rim hop and blah, blah, blah. No, never.
00:00:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done it.
00:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me, I want to send this to you. I'm texting it. These are my past clients, current friends, very smart people who are
00:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
um they used to do before covid they were agency um and for yoga studios and amazing like they spent a little bit time creating marketing campaigns and they blew these brand new so it was like um great the guys that make smart tools are your clients yes oh that's funny i know david what's his name bought this and met like no as a customer oh yeah yeah he met them at the high level event he met Jason and chandel uh i believe so yeah and i think he's a subscriber so but mostly his daughter is the sort of the face of that but yeah when david and her went to uh Austin i forget where the where the thing was but yeah he he was so funny he goes i met the number one affiliate for high level and i go uh cooch and he goes yeah um Did you know that? like, I know him. I've known him for years. He's like, that guy's the number one affiliate. I go, I didn't know that. I know he was partners, maybe with the number one. Anyway, David's a subscriber that Jason also had, uh, he had this one thing that it to no longer needed, but I almost bought it be. I mean, because there's somebody else that does something very, very, very similar. I'm a subscriber of the other guy. I'm not a subscriber of Jason. David's a subscriber of Jason. I'm a subscriber of, uh, the other dude. can't remember his name, but I use power tools or something else like that too. It's very similar. Yeah, I have that one. David has, David has Jason and David matches.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So Jason's a beast. He's super tall and she's really short and they always did video even though Tina never did. I'm really good about it now. And she used to be a hairdresser. And they. They used to do media buying, but they did all the campaigns. They created all the marketing and really just the whole growth business plan. And then they did the ads and they wrote the copy, they tracked everything. And they did amazing for these yoga studios that then COVID came and shut everything down and went to here. But Jason, they're both brilliant. Chandel loves the systems and the marketing. Well, he loves marketing too, but so he loves marketing and the tech. And he is really brilliant at creating the tech and snapshots and creating the automation and she loves the marketing, but does the customer support, the hiring, the deadlines and all that other stuff. and I've watched their kids grow up and yeah, anyway, but you know, to me, they're kind of like under the radar, but although I've I mean, their group is just growing.
00:04:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I see people in here that I know that have done a good job. He gets called out fairly frequently in the main group for a couple of his bits and pieces. Oh, does he? Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. That's awesome. Yeah, right. you're saying, hey, man, the other guy.
00:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They're like the two go to the tools. got, oh, wait, wait, wait, okay.
00:04:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I'm like, no, it's a wife. Okay, I just want to make sure I don't save you. Yeah, I can't think of the other guy's name, but yes.
00:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think I got their stuff and they offer like, they call it like white glove service or something like that, where you don't have to do anything for your people and they'll do it all and.
00:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, that's yet another guy. Yeah, that's like, it's Stanley. There's two of those.
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine. There's like two of everyone. Well, what I love about these two most is that, I mean, they're just super smart. And I don't know, like Jason just gets excited about this. But he has the balance of Chandel, who is like, okay, but we need it to be this and just kind of whatever. And they also have Tina thoughts in the back of their head, although I'm telling them, okay, don't do this, don't do this. I think that's fun. So anyway, but like, as far as like collaborating type, they're just, they're, they're mom and dad. They're at hockey games all the time. He cooks like crazy, amazing food. She was an air dresser, so she still loves all the beauty stuff. Anyway, they're just so laid back down to earth and they're in this world, but they're not schmuckery's like, just, you know?
00:05:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do. Yeah, because I think that, you know, the good thing about high level is that the people that got in early, like then, like a lot of these tools providers, the early onset people, they were solving real problems. With real solutions, and now you have the hacks coming now you have the this Not just the bang whiz and you're like okay, whatever and it's someone that's been using high level for like a week And they bought some of our snap shot. No reselling it Thank you. Yeah, okay No, thanks Oh God now what happened Do that again somehow the audio button is just like Below my browser cuz I'm not looking at zoom.
00:06:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was behind my browser, but apparently it was just underneath it and so I was clicking Anyway, they had given me a high level account, but she was like tini you should just really have an agency account like Okay, I didn't think about anything. I'm like I just don't even want high level whatever But now that you're talking about it, and I know and you got that one snapshot. I really do think it will be in my best interest to understand this for I just see their growth like I was turned off by the whole Frankenstein code. Yeah, but what I see now is almost like I'm trying to think of the word but it's like socialism. Like I mean open sources Frankenstein code, Franken code basically all the things that are built off of it and so and also I'm telling myself there's no first of all I don't like anything being housed under one roof but this really isn't that because let's say high level did something really stupid and just blew it up whatever there's now this whole community of people who for sure even if they're not coders have coders who can very quickly pivot and splinter off a whole lot of related things because we're all now having thoughts we've never had before, it used to be owned by an entrepreneur or an infusion soft, and you couldn't compete with them. And now this is like a building full of all of the greatest minds helping to build it. so it doesn't feel as much of a death wrap is like, anyway, something else.
00:08:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So only way goes sideways. And I'm not sure it can even go sideways, but what will be inevitable.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And for those of us that have been in the game long enough, it's like in a huge, a huge enough.
00:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Remember when everyone was an infusion soft affiliate? Oh, is same thing's gonna happen here. Eventually that affiliate play no longer exists and they get rid of it. And then that turns into we're gonna raise the price.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes.
00:08:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's it. Here's down the road, right?
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. because the pace of everything is exponentially faster and increasing. I don't, I don't think that timeline.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I see them doing it right now to through these add-ons, right? So a perfect example would be their, their, I think I'm not exactly sure what the relationship is here. So they have the conversation AI add-on. It's not have gone too deeply into this. It's not clear to me if it's theirs or if they have a licensing deal with someone else and it's, it's that. But either way, that add-on per account, 40 bucks.
00:09:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's huge.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's a huge markup. That's a huge price. I even know what the markup is. So I see them doing that. Like they, they create certain add-ons and that's actually a way to get more money without raising the price. I'm like, they can do that too.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I see that. I mean, because that's what everybody's doing is talking on to it. So anyway, but bottom line is I definitely do want to get into it and learn it because the one thing I do know is that somehow I'll think of a question somebody hasn't thought yet and then they'll be a day on and be like, you'll have a thought. There's no possible way I would think what you think. I cannot even come close to the things that you think. But when it can be as a catalyst for you thinking what you're thinking, I'll do that. Check it out. Yeah, so did you push that button yet?
00:10:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I didn't, because when I went to push it last night, my browser would not cooperate and I'm like, I'm just going to shut this computer off.
00:10:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a sign that today is over.
00:10:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I couldn't even close the time. oh my god, I'm going to close this time. But I will set it up right after this fall. Because it's Thursday, and it's Paul's day. It's Paul's in random tasks day.
00:11:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so there you go you know what i don't know if you would ever need it like i need it because i do but i do so many different things but you do so many different things and it is this extension called work on i'm sure i've told you i've used it yeah i use it religiously do you i i didn't see the i always have two browsers open and they're color coded because they're each in different google accounts which just makes it easy because i always have two i always have my mission tab open constantly because when i get a few breaks it and also it just serves as a reminder hey i've got to go get some work done there yeah so feel 12 hours doesn't seem like a lot but it is a lot but then i got it yeah and it also has to be concentrated work so anyway Um, so I have those two open, but then so I can switch in between each client, but then I have one that's like for my course and ones that's just AI research because I have all these different tabs that I'm looking at and one for finances and, um, one that's like, I have few miscellaneous, I have one for school because I'm back in school and Etsy and like all kinds of different things and it's so much easier to switch back and forth. And I do catch myself opening something because I'm in a browser and I'm not in that tab and like, oh, switch it. But then I can just easily go move that tab to the workspace that it belongs. You have to pay for it. If you're only using five spaces, it's not worth it.
00:12:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, but right. But you could also do like, just go, this is but like, the way that I end up being effed is like, I'll have essentially three workspaces open across 20 times. And it's like, oh, all this ninja stuff should be over here. And then over here should be empire. And then over here should be fan flowy. And then what I end up with is just the row of tabs and they're not even next to each other.
00:13:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, which one is it? So, so you're selling me? Yes. Because also I have my computer is amazing and very fast. It can handle a ton of browsers. But it's browser windows, but there's still a limit to it. And I am one to push those boundaries. So this makes it easy. And I don't want to have to bookmark everything. And I lose stuff. And I don't lose things anymore. But also it serves because I've got that row of spaces on the left. Like, Oh, yeah, go check on that. Oh, I need to go check on that. So because I'm always in there choosing a space every day, I'm also getting a reminder of the things that I look at and work on most without having to be in a company. Completely separate app like a reminder app or my calendar or something else going.
00:14:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, go look at that So anyway, I've been you know you can you oh you don't have back, but you can reduce like Okay, you can reduce that down right so that it's then in the bar and you're like, oh, that's my throat That's my basis work. I'm and then I could just launch that right. I literally have one called basis Okay, I'm gonna have to go. gonna have to this might be what I do this afternoon because I it was like I actually started feeling that it's the perfect time to start feeling that this week damn this is getting You know, it doesn't work and then I get to this place where I have to use the one tab because everything's just so janky and Then one tab reduces everything down to links, and then I'm like I never go back to it No, like they're there right. That's exactly the problem.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm like I never go back to this That's why this is such and Although
00:15:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's like a cleanse, like, yeah, but that's always bad, though.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you need the tabs. Look, we're a tap your brain has multiple tabs open, your computer has multiple tabs open. It's just, it's the way your brain works, but I'm being able to switch from different devices. could log into my Chrome account on somebody else's computer, log into work on it and have all my stuff anywhere and just what you can.
00:15:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's a problem I run to run into when I'm making music is because that computer is not my computer. But I have to sign in sometimes is me and sometimes as I have a shared account for Apple for that. And so, so it also has a email address. So sometimes I have to use that, but 99% I use me.
00:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All you have to have is have whatever browser you're using install. We're gonna as a plug in on that machine. And then it's all into your Google account and you have all of your tabs open, right?
00:16:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dealing.
00:16:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I just might be pop open as soon as you click on the thing.
00:16:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's interesting.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yup.
00:16:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need to. I do that too. I'll sometimes be on my laptop and then I switch to that computer and I have to look it up again.
00:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. It stays. It's transverse.
00:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so what will happen though is I'll go on my laptop. So then all my bookmarks are inside Workana because that's the other thing because then I have to redo bookmarks and but I don't because I'm like I'm not doing that.
00:16:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you don't and let's say you have a tab that you open frequently but you don't need to have it open all the time is let's say you've got 30 tasks tab work. Yes. Okay. So what you can do is save that as a resource and you can save it as a resource across multiple things. maybe. teamwork across spaces across street law anything else like that and you save it as a resource with one click to multiple workspaces and it's not an open tab but it's still easy for you just to go and click from the work on a home screen. Okay so here's the other thing so like let's say I have the tabs open my mission tab on my desktop and then I go open up my laptop and it says you were already working on this in another location do you want to resume work here and so I can say yes and it just takes over the most recent tabs and then just so the work transfers let's say I closed tabs on the laptop they're closed on the desktop when I come back to it.
00:17:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh wow okay. Interesting.
00:17:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just client I told him about. He's like yeah it wasn't. I'm like, and you're not using it right.
00:18:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
promise you because. Right. That's exactly the message I'm getting. But it's also like I just there was no there. That's a perfect example of they don't really tell you I'd use it. Yes. You're like, how am I supposed to use this? Like this is like a mini course, right?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is like that's exactly that. And I think I'm like, I need to do some of these little hacks. Let me make sure my daughter's OK. Yes, OK, yeah. When I teach people stuff, because it is these little things.
00:18:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, Tina, Yeah, yes, but that's the other thing, too.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like finding examples like this because a lot of people have really amazing stuff, whatever it is, do a terrible job of marketing, especially local, like local businesses. I just I look at them and I think I've never seen it out of yours like ever. And I just anyway, whoa.
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, yeah, totally.
00:19:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:19:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Market's best wins.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It markets at all. That's the thing. Speaking of markets and market share.
00:19:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And another 71. How are we doing? I think I did the math roughly a few days ago. We're like, we're up like 16%. So we're gonna we're we're approaching 3.6 million. So we're we're on. I mean, I think we can get back to four because that's was like our apex. And then I'm still some of my Mercer stuff didn't work. And then some of it's not going to work. I got another answer from them today. So for yesterday, so now I got to go check. I set up some new stuff. going to make sure it's working. I think one thing is messed up. I'm going to have to ask them why it's partially working. But I got to peek at it really quick. first but if Mushi's new thing is tracking and the stuff that I overlooked that I added is working and then I got the video thing's the one that's broken I got to get help fixing that then I'm like done as far as like all right I know how to set a custom event Mushi I know how to set these other events these on page events the standard sort of built in which would be the video one then I know how to do sort of the his his ace events set those up don't know how to do them in GDN yet because they weren't working so I haven't taken that up with Melissa yet but if they're working I can get with her and then I need to go I still need to go through one more module now then I can go into the advanced JavaScript and just see if there's which is essentially what I did with Mushi anyway but that was very specific to me I want to see what they say like is there anything from that that makes me go oh that's interesting oh I could do that uh so ideally I would get that done I don't do it today or tomorrow right next week but then we're also going to visit Santa Cruz next Thursday so yeah so I can't be on a conics Thursday although I totally didn't think about that when I put the flight but I'll be on a flight or I'll be touring the campus I'll be doing one of the other I know you don't like calls on other days but can we reschedule yeah we can do it on Friday if you can do it on Friday or okay yeah Friday are gonna still be there because I can move it to Wednesday if you'd rather move in and out Tina boom boom okay we're just doing a tour and getting the lay of the land and then and then in two weeks we go back again for the movement Thursday no on a Saturday

00:22:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:22:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Encore. No, thank you. Yeah. No, I'm looking for that. Any day would be a day to send a message. Right. Probably that. So I don't want to be a part of a message. Thursday it is.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's crazy too how many people had stories of they were supposed to be traveling that day, but something happened or somebody said go or They knew they shouldn't go and like, why am I?
00:23:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, so you were about to tell me when you think it was going to get done.
00:23:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then you. So I'm going to try to get it done next week. So I mean, I could probably watch a bunch of it on those flights, too. So that's ample. Airports are great for that stuff and flight.

My throat is killing me because I almost literally choked to death. I thought I was on a call talking to my friend. And I'm like, I'm really, truly going to die. being here.
00:23:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just just be aware about to die.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had these capsules and they got wet and they stuck to each other. I'm such a miser. I could swallow that. almost did not able to. And it was mind over matter because I had to keep shoving water down. But the water wasn't going down. And I'm like, it's just coming back up. And I'm I'm just in suffocating. as a role, by the way, especially for an asthmatic when you've suffocated almost to that many times. Well, lovely. Well, I'm okay with it. It hurts now.
00:24:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, well, then it feels like they're still there. That's the worst part.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fortunately, that is not what's happening. Yeah, but it's just like everything just feels like if I swallow again, it feels like I have a sore throat, but I'm for all that it is, I'm like, thank you, God, thank you, God, thank you, God.
00:24:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, not dead, not dead.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, literally. When I could finally talk again, she was just talking, she had no idea. I'm just going here. I can't believe this is happening. Like, and I'm trying to dream what I was soaking wet. Anyway, it was an interesting morning.
00:24:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thought it's your dad.
00:24:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No draw, though. No, no, no, Exactly. We can just watch ourselves die. I feel like, I don't know, it's just surreal. Anyway, okay, so we're going through that and try to finish it by next week. And then what's the next?
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, ultimately, I would like to have tracking goings that we can go into 2025, right? January, we'd be like, all right, it's a normal year, supposedly. And then we very much know what to expect, right?
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Q, how is it?
00:25:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When not like 25, that's like a penny, but it's like, we're all intent, right? It's like, okay, no COVID, no, no exam changes. That is a change, but it's a positive change. I guess it's not totally normal, it's normal, or, I mean, I'm going to find out how many more that actually is, because I don't know, but the, and then just have, it's like this stuff is going to, should settle down in November, and then where people exit isn't December like all that stuff will happen as as it does But then it's like, okay, where are we really at if we keep this 31? Think I mean, I think 31 is 4 million if I'm not mistaken So it's like we've never got past that I Guess we could but it's not on purpose But if the numbers 31 it's like okay, 31 is the number to be and And then we'll do I wanted to advise a plan based on data shocker to figure out how to beat that number What was See this is why I need to make my dashboard, so Orange new subscriptions, okay, And you think that's for money, okay I Think that's for you know, that's our ideal number based on historical data. It's like that's the best we've ever been and kind of thing. So, we'll see.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, just out of Thirty-one puts you over four million.
00:27:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thirty-one, yeah.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Roughly. And we'll find out where if the ceiling is real or if it changes because of all this stuff. So, I just, I'd curiosity, don't know how this works because I don't know what the different sections are. But I wrote how many score releases for CPA Exam 2025. This is the course Becker said, the course sections will be available with continuous testing and 16 different score releases release dates in 2025.
00:27:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The core is odd for in reg.
00:27:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's four sections in that, right?
00:27:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, it'd be other sections. I forget what they're called, but those, Those are probably so all the additional score release. So I guess this is what they're doing. There are now section dedicated score releases. So the score releases that the score release. The core score releases usually where we get our huge bump and that will not be we won't be as effective as much because the number one section is far. So it's still in core. Therefore, their back is gone. Back is going to be those other things. And back is this I think the lowest section. So if anything, if we will either get the same outcomes around the score release or nearly the same, and then you're just going to get all these bonus outcomes around the supplemental or whatever. And there's three tests in that. But you only have to pass one so it's like ISC TCP and something else they pick one they have to pass it We don't really know the failure rates and stuff yet because I'm not people have taken it to fail But that number will be more solidified by Certainly by the end of the year If I add these up, I think it was around 23 and I don't know if this is right But I would imagine What do they call them the other ones?
00:29:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Disciplines the other ones are disciplines 16 And there's no other But unless 21 22 23 24 25 Are these
00:30:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, that's this year, right?
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's right, right.
00:30:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why. Those are the remaining ones.
00:30:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:30:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. that's all of them. So, I'm pretty sure that's way more core releases and core releases are where we crush.
00:30:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
00:30:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And so, we should benefit just period, finally, something might go in our favor.
00:30:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, 16 core releases, how many are there normally?
00:30:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's, there's been no normal, right? Oh, yeah. stopped doing them. Last year, they changed it, right? So, we'd have to go look at like 2019. I'm sure someone still has that post it somewhere, but I don't know about that. I'm That's something. Yeah, that sounds right. It's like, I was going to say, it's like two or three a quarter.
00:31:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So five more score releases than 2009.
00:31:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Five more core and then totally new ones. Well, not totally new, but they're new as of this year.
00:31:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
2018 was 11. I it. I'm thinking 2025. And do you really good for another spending?
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, yeah Does Jeff know how good he has it with his van? Yeah He should just making sure yeah, he just doesn't like He just doesn't like when I say no Don't like it. I already know where your hands is going to be. No, but let me just get it out.
00:32:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I go. No Hi Yeah Good like he's waffling on he's waffling on doing the new products.
00:32:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like we are doing it And he tried he tried to argue You know argue his point on monday and he's saying, you know when we did We did the subscription thing. I go dude. Well, we did the subscription thing I knew exactly what was going to happen If we did exactly what was on the sheet and we did you even call the timeline pretty close Yeah, yeah, it was all map. So here I said, I don't know what's going to happen. So he wanted to lower the make of the low end price $47. I'm like, no way, man. That's a bad idea because you're baking in a potential failure. I'm like, it cannot be lower than 67 because worst case scenario is everyone buys the 67 still and we have achieved nothing other than there's now a clear separation between a supplement and a course. And yes, some people will buy the course, but we have no idea. My argument is we raised the base price $10 and then we sell the other one for $87 and I'm sticking to that idea. And we're baking in growth. I mean, Jeff has had a winning idea or two, Oh, yeah, totally.
00:33:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He comes up with stuff that I don't. But when it comes to the math of these types of things, I mean, the odds are in your paper for sure.
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's, I mean, it's come out. She also wasn't understanding, I got, dude, we change the price of a subscription, we are starting at zero. You're literally erasing everything because we have no data on a $47 product. So then you have to wait 18 months based on our AOV or LTV to know what's really happening. go, that is not worth it.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, I saw a post of Noreos today with his watercolor.
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you see that? No, I haven't mapped it on the Facebooks at all. What?
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a good distressor, but he's very proud of it. And it reminded me of Eor. So I thought about Mark's view. Terrible. They have that correlation. Yeah. So. It's not, I don't think that this is gossip, can not say anything, but, which is very interesting to me to get to talk to Chona, and I don't know anything about her other than you tell that people said he shouldn't marry her, but she is very enthusiastic. I'm like, is this going to be like when a, you know, husband recommends his wife to something and there's a strange woman, but she is so excited to work with me and so enthusiastic and so open and just really like kind of incredible, like the kind of person like, I just like, I love you, like, you're just so awesome. And anyway, and the first thing, well, the only thing that came up was, she's like, see, have to check my brain and be like, is this okay to share or whatever. This is between you and me and also, I think that is some type one good because of the. don't see intimate level we work with Mark and I mean that as just talking about the hard things that he goes through. We're not the average business people.
00:36:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:36:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the biggest thing is that she's like his brain is like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all over the place and I could do this and I could do that and she's like I don't understand how that works. I'm like calm down. I don't like you know so he's got these big dreams and big visions and she is just starting to because she's a Filipina woman.
00:36:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Women in general are are bred to do a particular type of thing but especially in certain cultures and definitely in the Philippines and it's not to dream big and do big and act big but she's in this world where she's around very successful people all the time and thinks you know I could have that because Mark encourages or Mark thinks that she can do so anyway I can see how that would there would be a lot of resistance of not knowing how to to be in a world where you come from a culture of, I don't know, not the flash that Mark is around all the time, you know.
00:37:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah, totally.
00:37:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, she's just like, I just, and I told her what I would do would bridge would be to bridge the gap between his excitement and his big vision and pace it for her and explain it to her. But I don't think that he can because that's the thing that I do, I think, really well as liaison between different types and personality types. And she's like, oh my gosh, that would be amazing. Anyway, she's, she's excited and I'm excited about it. And so anyway, I'll show that because I just think that that's cool. I also humbled and honored, I guess, if anybody puts you with their family member of any type, I just think what a compliment. So, thanks. also you gave me again. And also D&D company, I want to give a thanks to you guys, but
00:38:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
because there's going through things I know but you didn't but you didn't give me any ideas you said you gave me ideas oh i think i think so fixated on this like getting the whole moving like can't talk about it because i'm like it's happening like it got dropped in my lap and then but it's like people around her acting very weird right just like okay i'm gonna make this happen moving a needle in right yeah not you guys okay no no yeah that whole thing is like now it's real becoming more real right and it's but also it's like none of us know what it's right it's like it's just conceptual it's like yeah so what happened yeah yeah but even in the beginning it's still surreal until holidays or something happens and
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs you and she can't immediately get to you. Although you've got way more resources so you can do that quickly. But, yeah, it's, uh, exactly. Thank you.
00:39:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's why I dand signed up for Southwest credit card that gets points.
00:39:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And gave Denise one and said, you can do this whenever you want them.
00:39:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Both, both you.
00:39:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They don't like you, but they're going to know you're amazing.
00:39:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good job, dad. Good job.
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anyway, if just a type of gift basket, something, if you have some ideas, I don't want to nag you about things or bug you, but you forget. So I'll just do texting and teaming until I get an answer. Okay. So Stacy said, um, I got more questions. But in terms of like, you said Bobby finished, she wasn't aware that he'd finish in about as I was wrong. Yeah.
00:39:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:39:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Yep. Um, but it's getting worked on still.
00:40:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so I didn't realize that he so him and I have had a conversation about, uh, we're using like reset you as the example. So I think we had this conversation on Thursday. So like they made another request for, I'll just say a funnel. And the problem is that this is so sad. Apparently nobody can scope this except for me. Because Abish, I could be Jay's version. was like, Oh, think that's right. Bobby's version. was like, eh, that's not right either. And then Dan's version was, can't we just do X, Y, Z? And then those guys are like, yeah, we could. I go, OK, well, then let's that's how this is done. But then it and also my part. the problems then. And then I pointed this out. In the future, this would be a template. This would be a cloud template. So let's keep that in mind. Right. So in the future, if someone didn't, basically what I was like, Hey, no, no, no, we can just copy this funnel kit funnel and swap out the product. Done. Now if they want this to then go into lead flow or whatever, like this funnel does, then we need to, you know, estimate those hours or how much I can be doing this with those hours, which they can easily do. And I was like, but if it was just in the future, it was like, Hey, they want sales page. Well, we're going to have like sales page, ABC. And then we might have funnel AV that we might have phone or we might have whatever, right? And but it would be a cloud template. And we would say, so it would be launch cloud template, create product if it doesn't exist, attach product done. So we figured that out and then that reduced the scope, essentially, then, mean, I have to check in VJ's rate for that is like 25 bucks.
00:42:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:42:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Bobby's like, what, what, what do we raise it? I go, my answer was all I'm saying is it needs to be a minimal 40% and Bobby's like, I think we should triple their price. I go, is that a minimal 40% because I go, is that a minimal 40% because it's way more than that. go, great. How much does it come out to be? It's like, it's 150 bucks. I go, I go, I like that better because then that sort of bakes in them being able to raise their price and us not having to, right? So, but I go, I always want to have a 40% profit margin on whatever we're doing. That's my target, right? We're not going for an agency 15. We're going for 40. just that's it, right? And then, so now. from that perspective, I was like, we can go revisit the pricing of the service from that vantage point. How do we say, how do we figure out what is the 40%, so it's not 40% now, it's that we're getting maybe it's 60 now, and we know that, hey, we're going to have to, this is going to happen, right? We're going to have to upgrade the server with Presidion. Well, that's a humongous price height. It's quadruple, but we won't be using all the resources, right? We're just going to absorb that cost. So you go from 800 to 3000, and I got, we've been avoiding it for months and months and months. like, no, we're not switching, because I'm not, I'm not eating that cost right now. So it would be like, okay, we have to factor in that. And then we have to factor in the Abish again, DJ, like I would factor in the doubling, right? And then, so where, how do we figure out that pricing that GPT will be? So that's, that's the last conversation I haven't thought about it on, I think it's 3-0 Friday. Except what I just said, I never said.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's it right there. don't know if I can have it, but I'll.
00:44:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's okay. totally know what I just said.
00:44:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I did make most of the notes in here. So if you wanted to look at that. Yeah.
00:44:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, because my other argument was like, we have to be comparative to a good job or whatever, but we don't have to. Pop their price.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can be higher than that. Well, yeah, because.
00:44:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's more than that. That's, this is a managed service. Yeah.
00:44:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is not managed. Right. Yeah. Yes, I'm just going to put this in here in your text or email or I'm just to send the link. I think that, I mean, it would be interesting to me to have a conversation with chat GPT about your scenarios where you can't get people on the same page with you about some of the text stuff and say, look, here's our scenario, here's the task, here's what these people said, this is their role, here's what this person said, so I'm checking BJ, this is what I said, this is what I suggested. I don't know if we could give it enough information to be able to help but. But anyway, the biggest thing is if you could come up with a, almost like a decision matrix for them to measure the logic and go, like, how did you come to that conclusion? What's the simplest way to do it, which maybe would be the decision point, right? little diamond, is it these options, whatever, which one is the simplest, whatever that type of thing?
00:46:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think the problem is that there is, like, we haven't defined, hey, these are the three landing pages, hey, these are the sales pages, right? They're defined only in design only, but they're not defined like, I mean, to be completely honest, they don't even exist in reality, right? They exist in that the blocks exist, so therefore you could make that layout, but we have never made the layout or used it, because the theme is irrelevant. So in the future, whatever sales page and checkout page reset you is using, I will get rid of it. It would be like, hey, put them on checkout page A or one or whatever the naming command becomes. And then there's no question, it's like, hey, they need a new funnel funnel one. Okay, great. knows what funnel is. funnel one is, what funnel one does, where funnel one lives. But right now there is no funnel one, right? Everything is, it's, there is no menu. The menu exists only in concept, but the menu does not exist in reality because the item on the menu also doesn't exist, but that should all be resolved come November, come October, asked Abishik for an update today, like, all right, Eric says we're on track with Frank. Are we on track with Frank? If we are on track, do you have an ETA for? the woofer site launch and he's asleep so I'll probably get that answer tomorrow. But I mean that's it, but that's literally D-Day. Or B-Day, basis day.
00:48:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Go B-Day.
00:48:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
D-Day's got the publications.
00:48:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to send that to you soon because I wasn't paying attention because I was talking to you. I'm just going to add this part into which is that you haven't defined the pages or the layouts and that that will help with the logic and the pricing.
00:48:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, the menu will be real, right? It'll be like it will be like you can have a picture, right? Here's what your burrito is going to look like.
00:48:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like a catalog with an actual image that you can have and here's the you know the item in the catalog.
00:48:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah. Yeah, and then we'll be able to and that it will be in use, right? Fulfer will be using what would be check out page one and then sales page layout like the sales page layout is, you know, the copy that Maria and I did and the design is done and if the copies all in it, like, but it's been built how you I'm going to I'm started meeting with her this week, every day. I'm again.
00:49:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so.
00:49:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Every day. Yeah.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So all 15 minutes a day. So I can just get a I'm talking to somebody who cares about what I'm doing. And so I get a little like accountability and. On the bill of body. Yes. Um, I think, I think, um, the, there's equal benefit to both of us, but the power I know of what I'm giving her is different. She already feels different. She's excited. She's on fire. she's, she's like, I should be so tired today. ate gluten and I went to sleep late. whatever she's like, but I'm energized. I'm like, that's what clarity does, baby. But yeah, so I think that I think that will be really good for me. But like one of the things we did today was I asked her basically her business origin story and she's amazing. Like she's done crazy things and she's probably a genius. And just really, um, I don't think she's always played small, but, but she, uh, again, I don't think I'm, I don't, by the way, telling people to have to think.
00:50:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, her and I went deep.
00:50:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry. So anyway, basically being married to a narcissist, rector, as it does to women, uh, get anybody. Yeah. But yeah. So anyway, I think that, um, she's just. and new seasons of life and everything else. But anyway, she's really, really smart. She just is not centered on anything. I'm trying to figure that out, but I think her heart is her center because she just loves business. both had paper routes and bought our first bikes with our paper route.
00:51:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, I didn't feel like you two have parallel vibes and almost parallel resumes. Because she was undercover behind the scenes on some largish stuff. But then ultimately, it didn't work out, right? Whether for whatever reasons, right? the business was F-ed up or the guy was F-ed up or whatever. And then she went sort of solo still undercover and she, like you, is very much resistant to it's bizarre. It's, I want to, but I don't want to do her own thing, right? So she's, so she's, she's putting her toe in and she's pulling her toe back out. And then she's like doing it. And, but it seems like it's inevitable.
00:52:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, he doubts herself very much. Yeah, which is weird because it's not how you deal with the narcissist for so long.
00:52:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, exactly.
00:52:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she's got the result. You do crap.
00:52:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Cause somebody literally tells you that every day. Yeah. She's got the results. So it's like, that's the part that matters. Yeah. She's got the, the, the speak, she knows the language.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She, she's very, she's data driven.
00:52:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Like, yeah, I mean, I'm dying to do something with her. just need a damn code.
00:52:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. We should do something with the three of us. You would balance us out. So good.

Yeah. That's how you do it. Yeah.
00:54:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she gets it.
00:54:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Funnels successes math, blah, blah.
00:54:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're going like, yep. Yep. I'm like, that's, and I could keep her focused. So she doesn't sabotage and over stretch and do too many things. So there's any, any way to help there or just, I would just love to see her work with somebody.
00:54:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good. I mean, it's literally my plan. I'm just waiting for the damn code and it's probably not going to happen until I realize it's probably not going to happen until January, but whatever. That's fine. New year, 2025.
00:54:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go. She's awesome. I'm so excited to see what happens though when she, I don't know, I like liberating people and she is a person that was guarded and trapped. told her it's, it's, I saw the mask and I was like, I'm just going to tell you, I think you're guarded and you can't be like that with me. So I'm pushing and we'll see what happens, but she let me in.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So anyway, yeah.
00:55:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
more smart women.
00:55:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm so excited.
00:55:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I wouldn't know about her without you either. So thank you, I had no idea.
00:55:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She was her. She, she.
00:55:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Keep my interest. But you find her because you go down rabbit holes.
00:55:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Hopefully.
00:55:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you for being a rabbit hole follower.
00:55:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. It was, she said something about writing coffee for women, I think. Or it was very into what I was doing with the chat GPT thing. The wolf or spreadsheet.
00:55:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:55:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Which we ended up using.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hard. Superized guys, any movement in that conversation.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I never even wrote them back. just. don't see a path. And so I realized with you, right, where I was like, oh, we really need this. Right, right, right. I reached out to Hamza, wrote him a brief scope, saw that he read it on Upwork, hit him up again with my favorite, my favorite response. Yes, question mark, no question mark, maybe question mark. And he responded, and he was like, I would like to do this hourly because it's, you know, a bit of a moving target, whatever. And I said, that sounds great. Can you give me an estimate on the hours that would take you to create a beta that we only use internally? Does it mean a thing? I just need something that we can bang on. And he said, I will do that. And I will get back to you. think he said he would do it today. I am not really logged in off work yet today. So I'll check on that. He's 40 bucks an hour. He's as good as hired. Let's see. He comes back and says $400, which I seriously tell you So yeah, I think he's going to say, you know, 15, 20 hours, not even how do you know, we'll see.
00:57:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they'll be way cheaper than they and some of you that supervise things that they're going to get. Yeah, but then you'll be a competitor, guess what?
00:57:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I'll be able to go back with them and say, hey, look, I just did this for $600, right? And the cost, I know the cost, I know I can figure out the cost for me to use their software and convert someone to an email. That's the only cost I care about, right? So for them to create a follower is 30 cents. I can do that with an ad. I can do it at a greater scale. So then the question is Can I turn the ads? What's the cost of turning an ad into a follower versus the super ice?
00:58:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's going to be super duper close and The way I do that is with potentially $1,000 What I'm just taking $1,000 out $1,000 ad Yeah, was like we don't spend it Which could still be all power flowing You know what I just realized It took me that when you were talking about lead flow you're like I've never been able to visualize all that it is like for me It was a system that and it took me forever to get here figuring out that it was your automations in high level But to me, but now I it's your high level account period Right that you call lead flowing Yeah, that's my white they don't dance. Yeah, I do not realize that. This is the thing without seeing the stuff when we talk about it conceptually and not screen share, I'm like, it takes me so much longer to wrap my head around it. Yeah, which is probably a useful conversation in when you struggle with having any conversations with Abhishek and Vijay, maybe doing more screen sharing as they're talking about things, just clicking on it, looking at it so that they can make the visual correlation between what's happening in your mind.
00:59:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I don't know what I think the issue there is, you know, they were, they like, the information gets to them incorrectly. So basically, they based it off of literally what Ross wrote the ticket. But then they did another task that Frick rope, and I'm like, why is this a landing page? Like, is there a reason why you guys made this landing page that I'm not getting? Because it shouldn't be a landing page. And then, and then, so Eric screwed that up. And then I started to, I was like, oh, we should do XYZ. And then I sent that. And then the next day was like, wait a minute. I looked at the page, then even I got it. I looked at the page and I like, whoa. You know what, I didn't even talk to the SNO people. So, you know, when the information you're working off of is wrong, essentially, or, you know, sort of mis-scoped. But that version gets resolved by the menus. The one that I just brought up is just a one-off that, you know, we just, it just wasn't obvious looking at the design, what it was to any of us. Yeah. Then I went to Gert. And then even when Gert. Sabry wanted, I was like, how did he do that? This is custom. Okay, I know what it needs to be now. So they actually built it right. It's just now we have to decide it should not be on the page for a different reason, even though it works.
01:01:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any updates on Mom? Just I got to get the book over to Katie.
01:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Katie was waiting to close on her house, which they did over the weekend and they're moved in. Just sent a photo with her large cheeked baby. The baby's got like jowls. like, oh my god. So much cheeks. So now that there she's like, you know what, we just got to get that out of the way. So I got to dig that up, send it over to her with my thoughts. What I was thinking as far as this metaphor of the organization and then her and Jeff was like, We'll do it, or, you know, that her husband's name or something? Yeah, he's also an editor. So between the two of them and me, we should be able to get it. then Mark's like, I don't give a what you do with that. It's a great, because that's pretty much my plan. Not giving a about what you think. Sorry, buddy. Good job writing it. And then that to me is like the Maria project. It's like a book funnel. Or that's one of them. So like I imagine you could have a book funnel and then you could have the freebie funnel, which would be the cheat sheet, right? Which is going to be a release cheat sheet kind of thing. That's the new one that Mark's working on now. Before we used a royalty cheat sheet that worked, but I'm not sure it attracted the right avatar. But then again, we also didn't have a funnel to drive them through, right? Like I was just proving. step one, can I get a lead? could now buy that stupid snapshot probably today and then get moving on that. Oh, I guess I need to make a mom account or I don't think I have one. Now I have to move the mom account like I told you now I'm just move it. gonna move it between agencies and then I'll make the team account. I do have a bunch of leads in there.
01:03:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I now that the girls are back in school, I'm just like doing the best of doing things out and they're not around all the time. It's something about just hovering as a mom when the kids are home. I'm afraid to get into anything because I'm not even kidding you. The percentage is probably high 90s. Every time I sit down and I'm ready to be creative, the people I care about most want to talk. nobody wants to talk to me for hours then hours hours and so I'm just can't about it because they're not gonna be here forever so I just be like okay let it go and I feel like a slacker and I judge myself and I'm like I'm not but still like that's just my priority but anyway all right it's 110 10 and they're texting me and I probably should let you go yeah I'll give you one update this is gonna be great it's gonna be like the cliffhanger update and then we're gonna I'm gonna just hang up on you and there is informing Jamie today that she's out I need to save those notes so apparently there's a 60 day first write a refusal clause that she's gonna tell Jamie this exists FYI so you have 60 days and she's asking for 300 grand
01:05:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Which is not going to happen.
01:05:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so then what does that mean?
01:05:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then she can go sell it without Jimmy's input at all.
01:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's rough. Yeah. I am happy for Heather. I can't not feel bad for Jamie. No, what she did in it, but I don't. Wish, you know, there's so many things that go into how she behaves. And not everything is her fault. But even when we do do things and it is our fault, you still kind of got to feel bad. Because somewhere something, something went wrong and it's just. I'm glad for Heather moving on and maybe it'll help Jamie. I we all have to learn lessons and usually the hard way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to learn everything the hard way pretty much. Yeah. mean. I talked to Heather and I said, just be prepared for like, no one's going to buy this. I hate to break it to you. And then so I'm like, you should have a, you know, owner financed thing on the table. She's like, I don't trust Jamie to do that. I go, no, I know you control all the finances. So the owner finance would be, I'm taking 80% of the revenue until this number is met. And then I'm releasing it all to you. Period. And she's like, oh, that could be a plan B.
01:06:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, girl, that's your plan A. hate to break it down.
01:06:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It looks like it's a plan B, but it's really, yeah, yeah. You might want to add a bubble to the bottom of that A because it's a B.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's man, business is like, parenthood too. Like you think it's going to be one thing and you build it to be one thing and it's never, but you think it's going to be no matter how hard you work it to be that way.
01:06:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, And I was like do it. Yes. was like just do it right now And then we had a call together this morning and Jamie was so awful on the call.
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like oh my god What's she?
01:07:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What's that I was gonna ask what she did, but I'm not trying to be like oh it was just like she all out of nowhere Was saying well, I didn't get paid to do the gen pucks of videos last time and you know It's got a big deal, but this time I want to get paid and Heather's like you've never been paid to do those. Yes I have I think we're just both misremembering Heather's like no, Jamie Never happened. Yes. Well in December of 2022. So clearly she like Rose is narrowed over to her head I got a large check in December 2022 right before the gen tucks deal launched Heather said yeah That was a member distribution because we were flush with cash Nothing to do with generation that's not how I remember it and Heather's like yeah, but that's what it is. There's no record of you ever. So then Jamie there because Jen Tucks came back. And so first Jamie didn't want to do it because they have so many bad reviews. And it was like, you know, there's a moral aspect to this. And I was so ninja on the phone. And I was I can't wait. I was when I talked to Heather, like, you see what I did there? And by the end of the call, Jamie was like, Oh, yeah, let's do the videos. I'm like, you're so weird. And that but then I don't know where she brought up this thing where she should get paid as the talent to do the videos. And then Heather goes, I guess we'll just do the the version that doesn't happen. And then it was like, oops. And then I'm like, Oh, this is so over. That was after the show up on video. No, I don't know. I was on the phone.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They might have been I could just imagine the faces on one of the calls with the two of them when they were going through stuff. And that was when Heather first started standing up to Jamie after we'd had some talks and I was like this is really glad I wasn't on video because I have no hope for me at all. Okay. Anyway. That's a terrible way to end a meeting on whatever. Go pet my dog.
01:09:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There you go. Me too. Let me go eat some food too.
01:09:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perky.
01:09:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's good.
01:09:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I am.
01:09:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
As matter of fact, exactly that.
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Seven years.
01:09:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've learned a couple of things. Here we go. All right.

Hello.
00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, how are you?
00:00:04 - Michael’s iPhone
Good, well.
00:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are you? Good. How's the babies and the family?
00:00:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's exhausting. I forgot. I forgot how tired you could go, but I can't complain to you. You are Esther. You guys are the ones actually doing it.
00:00:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, it is a family thing that whole, it's not just a women thing, although we definitely definitely got a lot to do.
00:00:30 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm pretty sure you guys do the bulk of it.
00:00:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, I just saying it's not just stuff.
00:00:37 - Michael’s iPhone
I will agree with you, that it's all right.
00:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My power, power went out and all my stuff. Yeah, I had to reset everything and like log back in and load my browser windows and all of that.
00:00:53 - Michael’s iPhone
So that almost never happens.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that was fun. So I'm just, I'm a little disoriented.
00:01:00 - Michael’s iPhone
to the one getting everything back up uh Mark said he hoped you got your GT4 yeah we yeah yeah it should be coming on Thursday oh okay um let's have you what's the progress on assistance or chef or anything like that oh so we found uh we found a home assistant personal it's like a task person and also to watch Mari so she's gonna come Monday through Friday from 8 to 12 or 7 30 to 12 and what we believe is that'll help us return Amazon stuff do shopping at Whole Foods our weekly uh returning things dropping you know is to UPS to kind of the tasks and then also when Esther's super tired we're gonna give her Mari for the morning and then she'll bottle feed Mari for the 8 o'clock and the 11 o'clock feeds and then let Esther sleep in or just do whatever she needs to do and then at 12 o'clock Esther will take over as usual for the rest of the day and yeah and then I usually come back and finish work about five so I'll take over or help out at five so we're gonna start there I love that plan my stinking AI note taker is also not letting me highlight so I just want to make sure I get that so 12 o'clock to noon um yeah we're gonna do it above board too you know a lot of them we want to just cash and I you know I'm in position where I don't really feel like I want to do that and risk that so we're just gonna do it above board we're paying her 35 an hour which is a premium but yes but then uh then we could do it above board pair, like a normal W2, like legally, we're supposed to, and then be done with it. Because yeah, I think I could find a cheaper person, like 25 30, but they all wanted cash. And I was like, I don't want to risk that, you get hurt, and then you sue me. Yes.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also, it doesn't, I, have you considered 1099 instead of W2?
00:03:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we looked at, I actually, we have an employment lawyer, and we talked about it. But if they're coming to my house, it's pretty much W2. Unless they're doing tasks like cooking, specific cleaning, but if it's like, every morning, eight to 12, like on a schedule, and it's, uh, it's tough.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, the schedule.
00:03:39 - Michael’s iPhone
It's only, it's, it's excuse us that that becomes an issue. But I was just like, I don't even want to, don't want to go in that. Yeah.
00:03:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And are you hiring her as an LLC or like a corporation?
00:03:54 - Michael’s iPhone
That's kind of a personal corporation. It's weird. Like, yeah, I set it up through Poppins payroll, so they specialize in
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
housekeeper payroll well what I'm asking is like are you using the are you minimizing liability as much as possible in your corporate structure no is that something that you consider maybe wanting to do that's a good point you mean like corporation hire yeah I mean even just an LLC is still you don't have to deal with unemployment you don't have to deal with any of that stuff although if you're doing W2 that's probably financially the best way to organize it in terms of protection from getting sued especially if that corporation solely exists for home operations type stuff rather than you know any of your other business so that its assets are minimized the her ability to sue you is minimized But also, you have to pay unemployment with W2. You have to do all of those things anyway. So an S-Corp really isn't gonna add any more burden, but it should give you some more protection. And also, there are things that you can do to protect your money and an S-Corp that you can't do and other things like hiring the kids, paying that type of stuff.
00:05:23 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, we already passed through one of the Corps. So yeah, actually, maybe if we made it sort of like an executive bonus. I'm gonna look into my accountant. Actually, that's a really good point. Maybe if we put another layer of liability besides just the work of insurance.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks, y'all, look at that. Every week, I'm gonna look for a way to be valuable.
00:05:44 - Michael’s iPhone
We'll try. I hadn't even thought of it. Yeah, because what I had talked to my accountant was like, hey, can I use business expenses to pay for this? And they're like, no, that's sketchy, like, don't do that. But if we're doing it for liability, we're essentially, we're giving the childcare, you know, as a executive perk to me and Esther. Yeah, but not trying to claim a tax deduction. I think that would be in just for essentially liability.
00:06:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, let me ask. That's great. Thanks. And also that, to the point of the type of people that you want to have in your life, having somebody who is good at wealth management and wealth advice, there's a big difference between accounting and wealth management. So the difference between multi-millionaires and billionaires think very, very differently. So anyway, something to keep in mind. All right, let's write that down. Okay, so 12th noon, you rattled off the task from me really quick.
00:06:42 - Michael’s iPhone
I would really like them one more time if you don't mind. Yeah, so she's going to work from 8 or 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. So the biggest things is like the weekly or by week or twice a week grocery shopping, returning Amazon things to Whole Foods or UPS stores. dropping off packages we want to send to UPS, USGS, or FedEx, and doing just random, you know, we need diapers, please go to Target, you know, stuff that we can't easily order online. So those are like the tasks. And then, under that house cleaning, she's going to do, we're going to have the housekeeper continue coming every other week. But she's going to do maintenance of the dishes in the kitchen, which is what Ester and I were driving us crazy. So she's going to do the dishes in the kitchen. She's going to help us with the laundry. I want to say my laundry because I have more than Ester and, you know, washing and folding my laundry and, you know, a light bathroom cleaning around mostly the toilets. And then, as a backup, if Ester's tired, she's going to have bottle seed Mari for the morning and just focus on Mari for the morning.
00:07:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. how did you find her?
00:07:59 - Michael’s iPhone
do you know about that? The value is like let's just explore that conversation a little bit so I'm familiar with it. Yeah, so I just started asking my neighbors, hey, you know, we're looking for a housekeeper, do you guys know anything? And then this lady actually came to our attention because she babysits our next next door neighbors to kids. She's been doing it for five years. And now they're both going to school in the morning, so she has no work in the morning. So they said, hey, you know, it'd be perfect if you guys took her in the morning and then, you know, obviously we'll do like normally act. so we had to talk with her Esther and then me and then also my my mom, my grandma was very skeptical. So we all talked to her and then we're actually going to talk to the my neighbor today little later today. going get on the call and just kind of bet her a little more. But yeah, that's that was kind of a process.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it hasn't started yet, but you're you're right there making that decision.
00:08:59 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, September 1st is when. And the kids at school starts when she'll have time to start with us permanently.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a very good day. That's the day Tina was born.
00:09:07 - Michael’s iPhone
So I put good blessing. Nine one in 1991, right?
00:09:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nineteen seventy six year of the dragon.
00:09:16 - Michael’s iPhone
I have no shame.
00:09:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I earned every strike. Every strike. Um, OK, so how will she roughly?
00:09:28 - Michael’s iPhone
Does she have kids? She's two kids there in Guatemala. They're fully grown. Actually, I'm sorry, they're in San Diego. They've brought their families from Guatemala. Her kids are in San Diego.
00:09:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so how old are the kids that she was babysitting?
00:09:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Four and six, I believe now. Four and seven, something like that.
00:09:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what kind of family are your neighbors?
00:10:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Two lawyers, they're two stay at home lawyers.
00:10:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the reason I'm asking is because it speaks to level of expectations. You know what I mean? If people in certain industries, you already know there's going to be a certain level of competence required, ability to communicate, ability to work autonomously. Generally speaking, higher level professions have low tolerance for stupid mistakes, especially on repeat. True. Right, so if they're both attorneys, even if they're not the most high-performing, there's a certain amount of effort you have to do just to get through a law school and medical school, right? So the odds that she's highly incompetent, or you know what I mean? Just because somebody refers you, somebody doesn't mean it's a good referral, but similar ages, similar neighborhood, which is going to be similar of a sort, income levels. You know what I mean?
00:11:01 - Michael’s iPhone
There's so many things that go into that So that's super hopeful and I'd like We've actually seen her at like the park with the two kids before like I've seen her multiple times that like the parks and Yeah, so every time I've seen her like she's not on the phone. She's not like texting, know She's always like watching the kids.
00:11:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that Yeah, that was a big thing too.
00:11:26 - Michael’s iPhone
We we had seen her. I so that's why we're gonna talk to the lawyer the owner today because We don't know how she's you know in the house Seen her in the house. I've only seen her in the park. Um, yeah, and what you have nanny cams We we thought about that we haven't Because mostly because estu is gonna be in the house kind of like the lawyers work Um, but yeah, we're thinking of that Well, um most of the services have apps and you can have sketch
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
tools where you can turn things on and off. So privacy mode, like if you only want it to be on during the hours that she's there, do a little research first and find something that you can just schedule beyond during this time. If you don't want the footage, you can save it to a cloud or an SD card so that it's not in the cloud and your privacy is your privacy, that type of but, you know, when it comes to your children, safety, things like that, something to consider. Also liability, if anything ever happens, you've got evidence and nobody wants to be that person, nobody wants to think about that, but after the fact is too late. Also, we all tend to be on better behavior when we know we're being watched and it doesn't matter or cause an effect, chicken and egg, it doesn't matter. Whatever draws us out to be better people draws us out to be better people.
00:12:54 - Michael’s iPhone
So it's like the switch, it's like switch, the housekeeper to know, like make it easier for her. to be on her best behavior, right? Like, that's what the book talked about is like, yeah, like, who knows if it's forcing her or it's like, you know, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like, the end result is she's going to be a little bit better because she is being watched. Like, yeah, I like that.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, look at that. We're applying switch.
00:13:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I like your book. I'm going to read that book. Like you said, it's short. I think I'm going to, I will read it four times because it's just a very, like, basic, easy to understand, like, makes sense concepts. And, yeah, I'm going to read it four because it's anecdotal, the stories pop out in your head.
00:13:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, that's the thing that's been amazing to me. I only read it once. I should go back and reread it. But I, the details of the stories that pop in my head and how frequently they do, I reference it probably several times a year. There's only a few books that I do that, which you would think it'd be more than that. But I can't say that about most books or anything that I've read. a single source that has multiple applications and that's one of them so that's why I don't recommend a ton of books but I gave one a mark today also that I haven't read for like 12 years probably called EMIF and that would be good for you to read as well I just think it's a good overall business book but it is about structure I have read that I think I have read that book it has like a really a lot of words on the cover it's like the EMIF yeah I read that I don't remember what the premise was it was about sales it was more about how many structure and maturity and menu items so for example you can't go to McDonald's and order a filet mignon because even if they wanted to go to the store get it for you and you said you were going to pay him $200 to do they're not going to be good at it you don't know what you're going to get because that's not what they do over and over again, but they want to be the best at what they have. So these are the limited items yet. Right.
00:15:08 - Michael’s iPhone
Was it even mastery or something?
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Revisited.
00:15:12 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah. haven't read that. Yeah. That's what it was.
00:15:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if revisited. Okay.
00:15:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. I'll pick that up and get it on book on tape. I do remember I liked it a lot. I don't remember. Yeah.
00:15:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then also talk about IBM. I think that was e-book, Emeth and they talk about org charts and that IBM was kind of unique in that it was born as a mature company. So it talks about companies from teens or like newborn stages and then beginner right and then teenage and then a mature company. And a mature company has SOPs has an org chart. It has all of these things, very specific functions, very specific seats and roles that perform each of those functions. functions and that type of thing. And it has been so long, so I have to go back and ask myself what I will.
00:16:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I will already totally read it.
00:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, it's okay. You don't have to do I do. I need to because because it is one of those ones that I it's a it's a staple. There are certain staples that that I like to reference. And it's because they're foundational concepts like switch those concepts. You can use them for almost every type of decision that you have to make that is high impact, right? Who you hire, how you hire, how you choose your how much time you're going to work, where you're going to work, that type of thing. Because it gives you a structural concept framework to run your decisions through. So switch does that.
00:16:59 - Michael’s iPhone
And think no, no, I'll really. For sure, I do remember it.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, okay, okay, so I'm excited.
00:17:05 - Michael’s iPhone
I forgot Yay, I love it. I love it when people are excited and they when I read over and over it is Peter Teal is zero to one It's about like starting a new business or thinking about like a product that you want off That's the one I've read like price five times now That's the one but but it has like the same thing like you're saying and like switch very simple concepts Like things like a checklist to go through in my mind. Like is this even a good idea, you know, so okay?
00:17:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'll do that. I love that love that Okay, so we're starting off with an assistant and she is going to tackle dishes every day Yeah, through Friday Right. Well, that's what I meant.
00:17:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry Monday through Friday The hard thing that Esther and I talked about is like Esther doesn't like leaving the kitchen dirty at night And so we're trying to like she thinks she would be okay and we're trying it for like a week because it's just very foreign to her like you've stuck in the kitchen sink overnight so yeah but she has just very skill like but I think yes just come around she's like let me try it you know we'll try it for two weeks see if I could like handle that she doesn't like going to sleep with the kitchen and mess I mean I get it but you know if you know help is coming in the morning that I feel like maybe we can try it and see and something that you can help her with this is is it because you know that in the morning you're gonna have to face that duty and you don't want to start your day thinking with that that is on your on your plate so it isn't that there are dishes in the sink it's that there are dishes in the sink that you have to deal with first thing in the morning or look at all day so if you because yeah no I actually talked to her but I did I asked her the question it was because in childhood she would get that she didn't have a great childhood she who would get yelled at if things weren't aligned. So now she makes sure things are aligned. That's the reason. And she even said, I get it. That's my reasoning. But it's hard to break that and go to sleep with that purpose.
00:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For that purpose, maybe ask her to commit to just 30 days. 30 days, draw how she feels progressively. But here's the thing. Our decisions should feed our values because of our priorities. Our priorities are from our values, not someone else's. And so the way to loosen ourselves from the past is to break the responses that we have as a result of them. So if it was really Esther's vow. use rather than a fear response. Um, that wouldn't have been what she said.
00:20:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So she's still she's still making it about a fear response rather than about her own.
00:20:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is to not give it any power anymore.
00:20:18 - Michael’s iPhone
So I like to practice taking the power away from dishes shouldn't have that power over her. That's right. I like that.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She needs your coaching. I'm here. Um, but we can do this. But this is, this is why I talk about the holistic approach stuff. Because yeah, she can help her.
00:20:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. If she could make that like if I could just put like a little bit of a carrot and be like, Hey, why don't you focus on your values? What do you want? Do you want the dishes to hold that power of fear over you? And if I could just get her just a little switch try it for 30 days, then it'll make our lives better at night. could focus on the kids at night instead of, you know, washing dishes.
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for 45 minutes.
00:21:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, you know, we might cook more right because you don't cook because we're so afraid of all the plate, you know, the pots and pans, so like that might be better. So yeah, I love this. I'll give her just that little nugget and see if she'll try it for 30 days and then see if it makes her feel better.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Great. So there's one more additional power in that because if you take that fear that came from the past. And if she's able to, you know, loosen its power, what other things is she's still doing because of childhood wounds? And what other hold can be broken? So because if you learn that you can break a hold, then you learn that you can break all the holes. Okay, yeah. I'll look around.
00:21:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. And she's a wonderful person. Like she actually goes to therapy, she works on the different, you know, she knows she has. as bad things and she works on them and you know she believes that some people don't think they can change but she believes she can change so yeah it's been really good.
00:22:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She's amazing but the other thing is our partners see things differently than us and we can't see all the things all the time and you can't do all the things all the time so this is where leverage comes in what are those things that have the greatest amount of power for good or bad so in our business in our lives we want to create the powerful levers but we need to undo the bad lovers the one that if I go to bed and the dishes are in there that I could have a bad night's sleep that I could wake up bad because of dishes now I like a clean house I I the energy my productivity my happiness is very much tied to it but having had four kids and being single and running a business and doing all of those things I had to let certain things go and and I got help, you know, around the house and learned it. But I have to let, I can let things go in the moment. So my overall value of cleanliness has not diminished, but the power that I give it when it's out of alignment for the moment is also diminished, because I'm like, it will be solved. I have a system in place to solve it. I don't need to worry about you. You take no more mental space.
00:23:25 - Michael’s iPhone
So anyway. Yeah, I love that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Astronies you. I'm I'm looking for about two or three more clients to be full, especially as we're going into fall, because I want to be dizzier when my girls, they don't need me as much anymore. They're teenagers like growing up and they're moving out. And I'm like, I need to take care of other people. So if you know somebody, let me know. OK, so we'll get into your sleep stuff. But this is a pivotal thing. Can you guys hire this person?
00:23:56 - Michael’s iPhone
OK, so let me know. think so too. I'm really like, I don't like to hope a whole lot, but like I'm like, man, I think if everything checks out with her background within, you know, the old, the lawyer that I'm going to talk to, and I'm really like, man, this could be great. So, yeah, we'll see. I'll let you know in September.
00:24:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimism is powerful.
00:24:17 - Michael’s iPhone
It's powerful. It's good.
00:24:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've learned to be cautiously optimistic, but I used to try to hold back my optimism, because a lot of things wouldn't go the way that I wanted to. But instead, what I've shifted that to is instead of holding the expectation specifically of it will be this way, my expectation is it will be improved and it will be better. Because of the specific thing that I did, or because something else revealed itself along the way, or because I failed at this part and I learned and I'm a step closer to actually doing it right. Either way, I lose. And so there's nothing to not be optimistic about because I'm a step closer.
00:25:00 - Michael’s iPhone
Regardless, I think I think like that almost about everything too optimistic, but yeah, that's how I think of it too Relined Okay, okay, so watching folding that's it.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a huge amount of stuff I'm super excited about that because we haven't really gotten to the business stuff yet But we came in with a baby and pending now the big is here now.
00:25:24 - Michael’s iPhone
There's there's tiredness and exhaustion Sorry, I'm in your meeting right now. I know I have a good day.
00:25:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice to see you again All right, anyway, so we always have to take seasons into account.
00:25:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Are you I wasn't gonna go to jujitsu because I was like, oh, I got I had the meeting with Tina And then I was like, no, this is what Tina wanted to like, let's get out and do what I Early Yeah
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes, that is fantastic. Um, so how has my energy right now?
00:26:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, it's been great. I love this port. Oh, it's just so good.
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, it's just, yeah, I love it. to me about how often you've been going, like, has there been an increase in frequency? Um, just just give me a little more detail.
00:26:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, the baby's been tough, but I think, uh, last Monday, I started going, again, I'm trying to go three times a week. So like Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, it's just every week's different. So I've been trying to go at least three times a week. So oh, it's just great. Yeah. Glad we paid for access. This was wonderful. Best $200 I've spent.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:47 - Michael’s iPhone
love that you phrased it that way.
00:26:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
told me to.
00:26:50 - Michael’s iPhone
like that. I know.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. But just because, just because I did that doesn't mean that that stuck in your mind and that because when you say it, you give it your own. on power. It's not because I said it. It's because you bought into it and now it becomes yours.
00:27:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I would pay $50 a class to choke someone out.
00:27:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. I think I need to do it too. I'm just a lot more calm everywhere when I do get a little, you know, rustling out of me. Yes. to that point, hold on, let me make sure I want to write that down. We talked about energy sandwiches a little bit when you've got some stressful things or you've got those like back-to-back meetings and things just jumping down and knocking out some push-ups or something to get attention out.
00:27:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Has that ever come up yet? I've been working so little the last two weeks. I really haven't done much work in general. Tomorrow, would say Monday. start working on Wednesday. So Wednesday will be, I'll be working again. So yeah, I mean, the things that I have got done, like the mission critical stuff, it's not really bothersome to me. It's like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there, and then I get it done. But I haven't really tried to enter just that one yet.
00:28:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's cool. And really, like I said, I think the foundational piece is, and we have to sleep yet, but we'll get to sleep. But is getting your home situation, like you just entered the new season. It's not just two kids, but it's infant all over again.
00:28:35 - Michael’s iPhone
So yeah, this is very, very very Like our, I could already see like our time is gonna be, well, maybe not so much me actually, but Esther's time's gonna be vastly different. So there's a couple things on her business that I'm gonna probably pick up the slack on a little bit, you know, to help her because, yeah, now this is gonna be, it's gonna be all hands on deck for her for the next six not so. Yep, is what it is.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so that I understand where your brain is going, what type of work would you be doing?
00:29:12 - Michael’s iPhone
On the Q and E work.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I said, okay, when you say Esther stuff, then you mean in your business?
00:29:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, Esther runs her own billing company.
00:29:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She bills for my Q and E work, but we segment it. Got it.
00:29:27 - Michael’s iPhone
And so there's, there are things that I'm totally, I just shut off. I'm just black and white. I'm like, nope, that's, that's the billing company. That's hers and her manager. And I don't think about it at all. Literally, I walk into my Q and E. I interview the guy. I write my report. I send it to them. They take care of the rest. But now I think there are things I'm going to step in that she was doing that I'm just going to pick up a little bit more slack on. And just help out a little part.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And before the baby, how many hours a week was as
00:30:00 - Michael’s iPhone
So working in her business roughly for she did she did a meeting on Tuesday, one on Friday, like an hour, maybe hour to a paperwork, but she has a wonderful manager, okay, you know, in the manager, a pretty good premium to be our manager. Basically, take everything off Esther's plate. The thing that Esther still has to do is just little things that are just very ownership related, I think. Okay.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the manager can't help you with that type of stuff in for QME?
00:30:35 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's, that's what I'm going to, I'm going to help the manager do a little more. But like, I want my wording a certain way. And so that's the part I'm going to step in and like work with the manager instead of Esther and the manager on doing.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Watch it.
00:30:59 - Michael’s iPhone
All right. my wording for how you can't advertise what I do legally, but I can say, I've done this, I've done this work, I've done this kind of case, as you could say, the truth. You just can't say, I'm the best, I will, know. So that's the point.
00:31:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that you could do to just just a thought, and it is just a this, not that document?
00:31:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:31:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Make that very clear. Okay. Yeah. Because if you give examples, and if you give enough examples so that she can understand this language evokes liability, this one doesn't. This one is a claim.
00:31:40 - Michael’s iPhone
is a statement. You know what I mean?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. evidence based, that type of thing. So that's the point.
00:32:00 - Michael’s iPhone
is what helps somebody be able to see the correlation.
00:32:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if she's intelligent enough, if this is not that type of thing, we should be more helpful. Love it. Yeah, that's something simple. And then astronaut can work on that too. I could just talk to Esther about it. And then yeah, I can come up with that.
00:32:17 - Michael’s iPhone
That's great. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Again, always leverage.
00:32:22 - Michael’s iPhone
whatever we can do to find some leverage and optimize the little things that you do, then you've got more mental effort for the big things. Big rocks, right? Yep, that makes sense. Okay, let me...
00:32:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so did you start using the Food Journal app yet?
00:32:38 - Michael’s iPhone
Yep, I believe I sent it to you. Tina at Profit.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I documented it through Sunday. Okay, hold on a second.
00:32:50 - Michael’s iPhone
And separately, I sent the weekly report to your email.
00:32:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know which one you prefer, but I sent the Dailys and the weekly. You should only have one email from me, I think, but...
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
As Tina, I imported it to Tina at Profit Drivers. that's me.
00:33:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a user report. Okay.
00:33:02 - Michael’s iPhone
Um, all right. Well, that's good. So that's in macros. Let's take a look at this. And then I was shocked. Like, I thought I over eat all the time. Esther thinks I underneath, but I was shocked that like, I'm pretty close to 2000, whatever that limit is that 2000 calories a day.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, but do you know what your BMR is? I don't know what the BMR is. Basic metabolic rate. Like what? No idea.
00:33:29 - Michael’s iPhone
Burn on average per day.
00:33:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they calculated it by your age, height, your weight. I'm not even sure if height is in it, but that's what I put in there.
00:33:40 - Michael’s iPhone
And then that's what they said, like whatever that number is 2000. Okay.
00:33:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what's your, oh, your budget is 2020.
00:33:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:33:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you're not trying to wait a minute. Correct. Okay. I'm trying to.
00:33:50 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. So then that's, that's probably what that is. That's very low.
00:33:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm a hundred and twenty two pounds. So it's a fairly low. That makes sense. Okay. Um, but what is your activity level? Like I would think that you're more active than you would need more calories than that because of Jiu-Jitsu.
00:34:09 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, actually you could see that like on the days that I did Jiu-Jitsu, I actually think I ate more that like I had a snack because I was just like dying.
00:34:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're actually under a little bit, but maybe not. So, and sometimes it comes down to macros and digestion and body energy, whatever. the whole, the whole point of it is just getting some more and I shouldn't end just seeing. So let me look at that.
00:34:38 - Michael’s iPhone
sounds great. never done that before, but I started tracking and I was like, oh, okay, I guess I am pretty close to the 2000 thing.
00:34:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think your protein is low.
00:34:49 - Michael’s iPhone
And protein is low.
00:34:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because on average, just to maintain your muscle level and your weight. I would. say you probably need at least 100 grams of protein every day. So it's only a little bit under because you're averaging. Well, it should be, that would be, wait, seven days, yeah, 700, and you're at 663 for the week. So probably a little bit under, but we were already talking about more protein and probably you sleep at night. Unless it was fat and protein, because the things that you were eating weren't just high on protein, but they were also high in fat hot dogs, pizza. What was the other thing that comes? yeah, yeah, yeah, saturated fat specifically, which we definitely don't want to have more of. But I don't know what is the concoction that's helping you sleep better. Was it was it the protein? Was it fat? Was it protein and fat? So that's something to start really looking at is what is your, what is your your last meal of the day? So these are macros. That's helpful. I would really like to see the mark. specifically of the last meal of the day. And you can look at that in the log, go lose it. Dash or let's see, no log. Okay, so dinner, if you click on the dinner, let's say, go to yesterday's dinner.
00:36:21 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:36:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if you click on it, you should be able to see all.
00:36:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, view meal summary. There it is, new meal summary.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. So we want that just every day, and then we'll make a correlation of that between sleep. want to look at everything overall, too, so we can just kind of see when you do start making some changes, just what it kind of has an impact on your, like, brain fog sleep performance mood. Yeah, but, but that last meal of the day. So let's go look at. your sleep stuff.
00:37:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh yeah did you do I so I changed the document the old ones called outdated and I put a new one called spreadsheet.
00:37:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm quite proud of it I think it looks a lot better. Okay. Do you report weekly report? Was it no that's not the weekly report. Let me just I'm just gonna forward it because I'm looking under use specifically and I don't see it. There it goes. I came through.
00:37:41 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah that didn't come through.
00:37:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
for whatever reason I didn't come through before. look at that restful sleep. That seems like it's improved.
00:38:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Well, that's because Esther this week started letting me miss the two evening feeds, so that's what I've been getting a chunk of restful sleep.
00:38:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but your first week, like before the baby came, this is even better than that.
00:38:18 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, that's that.

This is, I mean, let's go to outdated. Shush, see if I have the original slide, whoops, the first one, yeah, oh, that was an apple lot, because the first week you didn't have that, and we're tracks differently. So I don't have apples to compare, but either way, let me. I do like this better. Why is it better? don't know, but it looks better. I can see everything. That's why. Good job. I put it bar.
00:39:14 - Michael’s iPhone
I put like the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But it's actually weird because Monday is actually looking at Sunday night sleep. Right. It's like baby for sleep. I remember that.
00:39:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:39:27 - Michael’s iPhone
So. Is there a way to look better now?
00:39:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:39:30 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you. I'm quite proud of Good job.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Somewhat rested. Oh, good. tagged how you felt. That's good. And that would be helpful to review too.
00:39:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, no. That's not antagonizing.
00:39:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the sleep tracker assumption. Oh, okay.
00:39:49 - Michael’s iPhone
Um. What is the app you told me?
00:39:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sleep watchers. Yeah. It does have a function to where you can set it to ask you how rested you felt. felt during the day or how fatigued you felt, so I don't remember what the language is, but I think it's fatigued.
00:40:07 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm just very happy these last three weeks. I've actually worn my ordering, worn my Apple watch to get the data. So yeah, it's getting incrementally better on our data. Okay, I'll try to I'll try to enable how like how do I feel when I wake up?
00:40:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not just how you feel when you wake up, but how do you feel middle of the day? Okay, good.
00:40:34 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm sorry, in the journal, I was making notes of that. Sorry, you out again. Oh, I was noting some of that in my journal vlogs. My daily journal.
00:40:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I have a really hard time writing?
00:40:58 - Michael’s iPhone
Sorry.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. Oh, It's a little bit better though, but it's also it's hard to go through that and find just the specific things that I'm looking for. So if you open your sleepwatch app, let me, let see what this says, sleep. There is a, let's see, is it for the setting, the course?
00:41:24 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, you know what? It's funny now that I open it. so I don't open this app every day. only open it when I send you the documents. Oh, okay. So actually, it literally, right now, it's just like, how well rested did you feel?
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, I'll start welling this in. Okay. Yeah. maybe I'll have it allow notifications. Because that will be the thing that will pop up in the middle of day. How fatigued are you? Okay.
00:41:57 - Michael’s iPhone
Allow notifications.
00:41:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. I'll think of it. Yeah. I'll play around with little. That's the whole thing, right? That's the iterations of it's a little bit here, a little bit there. So we're going to get the, let me just get back to my notes. So we need evening, macro, log reports, added to the...
00:42:23 - Michael’s iPhone
So maybe the best way for that is to take a screenshot, because I don't know, but I don't can get it. don't know if get all that way. Yep, screenshot would be perfect.
00:42:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
okay. And we don't have to do this forever, but a few weeks of figuring out, okay, what is all the data that's pertinent? What is the report that's giving us the pertinent data? Review it for a while, make some changes, and then, you know, do this exercise again in a few months and see how you're doing. Or... or if an issue pops up, or if you're like, I'm actually sticking really good, all these things are good, then we wanna go look and go, okay, what was the thing? So we're not gonna be digging into this, like this deep for such a long time. We're basically getting a baseline right now, making a very small plan for whatever you want to do, right? Cause you don't wanna have like a diet overall or anything like that. So this is just data, and then knowing what are the things that impact you? So when you're like, I need to do something different, this is not working, then you know what things are gonna have an impact on it. Okay. I like it. All right. I'm so excited that you found somebody.
00:43:40 - Michael’s iPhone
You don't get to start till September. I know. She said, you know, we could do some trial runs with her on the weekends and give Esther wants to get out. So we might actually do that and just trial runs or something. What about if in the meantime, you have your cleaner come every week? Yeah. Yeah, we've talked. to about that. This goes back to the thing I we don't really like our cleaner and Mark actually suggested. Yeah she's just a little, well I talked to I actually talked to Mark about this and our house is like little bit larger so there's a lot and Mark was saying maybe make like you know like that list you were saying for my manager or the feeling like Mark was saying why don't you make a list like that for your cleaners so it's like do this at minimum and then at least we'll be like happy yeah because right now she misses the window like not the window sills but when you open a window she misses the inner groove and Mark was like yeah but for a 3000 square foot house like unfortunately you're probably gonna have to tell her to like hit that so I was like okay so yeah that's maybe that's another thing I'll work on I'll talk to Esther about leaving the dishes till tomorrow and then also I'll work with her on creating a list for the cleaner and see if it works. And if it does, then we can increase it.
00:45:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because that's just like, I don't want to pay this person every week. I'm just like, OK.
00:45:08 - Michael’s iPhone
And you can change it every week.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I have my cleaning list. It's just a Google Doc.
00:45:16 - Michael’s iPhone
And oh, you have a list.
00:45:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can I have it?
00:45:18 - Michael’s iPhone
I mean, it probably wouldn't be relevant to you because I have a working on.
00:45:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she also is great at organizing like a Marie Kondo type thing. And so I've got her working on projects plus my baseline cleaning because I also have two teenage girls that want money from me. So they've got to earn it. So our doctors are going to be super different. But what I do is I tell her, OK, these are the things that need to get done monthly. These are the things that need to get done quarterly. And then here are the weekly projects. These are the must-dos. So if you're running low on energy or time or whatever, these are the things you must-do first.
00:45:56 - Michael’s iPhone
Or I'm not going to be happy. OK.
00:45:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. But thanks.
00:46:01 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
00:46:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then she has to go update the report and she'll tell me what she got done and anything that she noticed. if I'm out of the cleaning supply, if something took longer because there was an issue or she noticed something that I wasn't aware of, so put that in the report and then also confirm the amount of time that it's worked. So, you know, like if she leaves early, I want to know if she works longer, I want to know whatever that type of thing. So, yeah. So we've got the cleaning and then we've got the project that you know you don't get to the projects until the cleaning is done.
00:46:39 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay.
00:46:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. Yes.
00:46:42 - Michael’s iPhone
Yes.
00:46:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's the thing, the documentation and any type of business or where there's an expectation of another person that's working for you. It just helps. First of all, it's a paper trail. It's clear. expectations. And in a Google Doc, you can view the history. So let's say somebody goes and like, oops, I deleted it. Well, you've got version history. You can go back and see every version of the document ever. So you can say, well, she said, Oh, well, it didn't say that then. What day was that? Let me go back and check.
00:47:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh, actually, yes, it did. It said it on that day.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you know, it's accountability. And that goes back to the nanny cam and help people do their best. So, but it makes you be accountable. And this is the thing I was talking to you about before, making sure that you're being a good leader and a good boss by being clear. And so if the documentation says, which he didn't really tell me what I needed to do, he said this, this was not very clear. He said this and this is going to take three hours. And I did this because I only had two. So this doesn't make any sense, right? then now we know there's a communication issue and nobody addressed it. So who owns that? Does she own it? Do you own it? That type of thing. So, Oh, anyway, it's a, it's a hard process.
00:48:03 - Michael’s iPhone
I'm excited.
00:48:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This would be great.
00:48:05 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. think we're going to make a big difference, didn't you? Yeah, we've been meeting to do that list, like Mark said, but I think it's more specific list. That'd be great. We'll do it.
00:48:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that goes back to big rocks. First things first. So the big rock is, is, is really that the communication is clear and the expectations are clear. Because almost always when there's an offense or a problem, it's because expectations weren't meant. And usually when expectations are met, it's because expectations weren't clearly set in the first place thoroughly in all encompassing.
00:48:45 - Michael’s iPhone
Please make that a note. Esther has been telling me that for years and I agree, like when I lose my , that's exactly what Esther tells me. she's like, did you set the expectations for your person that you're frustrated? I'm like, no. Oh, but it's a common thing I you hit a nail on a head right there and please remember to keep challenging me when you sense frustration about Something just as we work together. Um, yeah, please know that's a huge problem. I have and I am trying to work on it, but What you just said when I get frustrated, I should probably turn inwards and be like, did I send my expectations right? they know how to please me? Yeah. Um, But great point.
00:49:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. need to do that. Yeah, yeah and um Another thought as I've been working on my like psychology. Did you agree? I'm like, man, I think we always have to be learning I wish everybody was learning because we just sometimes just get really complacent but um Just understanding what the mechanics of certain things are anxiety is basically the fear of the unknown That leads into expectations, right? If expectations aren't clearly said, I don't even know how I can satisfy them, do you know what I mean? So, think about working for somebody who you want to please and you ask them what they want and they told you and the tone that they use is, okay, this conversation is done and I'm going to tell you, you have that tone, I plow through it. It's not a bad thing, but you're like, the way that, okay, so if I do this, oh yeah, okay, that makes sense and I'm leaning in and I'm looking you and I'm pausing, there's potentially room to continue the conversation, right? You're like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What does that mean? How would you read that?
00:50:48 - Michael’s iPhone
I'd be like, okay, well the next time you do it, you better do it exactly right, otherwise there's going to be an issue there.
00:50:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Most people, and especially in a subordinate position. would take that as you just wave me off this is done you physically you physically make a signal a subordinate is most of them are going to take that as a that was dismissed this conversation probably should be over they don't want to hear more about it I have to watch when I do that and it's not necessarily a bad thing it's okay moving on but it is very much a signal of moving on when you're working especially with women first of all generally speaking they have to be very good at body language and signals women are raised differently but but you you learn you learn the environment you learn where you fit in what you're to do and women tend to just fall in line with that. So when I've been trying to hire and train assistants and autonomous leaders, I have to get them to push past those signals. And it takes years to do. And not all of them can do it. here's the crazy thing. It takes years to do, even with their boss, right here, saying yes, please tell me what to do. Yes, please probe. Yes, please hold me accountable. Yes, please ask me why I didn't do what I said I was going to do. Even with that, it takes a couple of years to get them to do it. And even still, they're like, I feel like I'm being bad. feel like I'm being pushy. feel like I'm being bitchy. feel like I'm, you know, like, and it's annoying people. So.
00:52:52 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, I got, I, I'll watch that next time I talk to, uh, I'm not going to have a conversation by manager today, actually, so. Well, we do it on the phone, but yeah, I'm sure there's signals that I give them on the phone room like, okay, done. Let's go. What are we doing next?
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's not really true. So what that you could do is just go, was there anything else you wanted to talk about that now? Okay. I'm also big on call control. I don't want it repeated. If you've told me the same thing twice, I don't want to hear it again. I don't, I got it the first time. And so I'm not telling you it's a bad thing. And I do the same thing, but I have to be aware of, okay, I have to catch myself in it and go, did I hear what you needed to tell me? Did we address the issue in full? Are you clear? Am I clear? If we're clear, let's move on. We don't need to keep talking about it. But if you're not clear, then, and I'm your boss, then I need to sit there until you get clear. So here's the other aspect of it. If you can't get clear quickly, and you frequently can't, get clear quickly, you got to go. I got to replace you.
00:54:03 - Michael’s iPhone
Interesting. Interesting. You know, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, when my manager, we get clear real quick with him. And I feel like we're on the same page, but some of the people we've hired that he managed is when I talked to them, I'm like, and I think that probably drives my body language when I talked to them because I'm like, okay, we said it, let's go, but it always takes me. Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know if we got it.
00:54:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know that. So, yeah, interesting. But but but then you have to ask yourself what's the talent pool possible that somebody can meet me at this level with what I'm willing to pay them. So then you have to decide what is the Are you going to take that amount of time every single time you have to get clear with them? Or are you going to go pay two, three, times as much? So you've got somebody who's just going and doing the thing. So there's always trade-offs. You just want to be consciously making sure that you've made the choice and then be in it because you're dealing with people. So if you have to explain concepts and it takes somebody three or four times longer than you want it to, but once they get it, they get it and they do the job, they're reliable, they're loyal, you know, they're lot of them. Then that is a trade-off that you consciously and willingly make and then you need to tell yourself, okay, I just got to calm down, sit back. Once you've gone through this, like, are you clear? And then you can practice, how do you get clear? What do they need? That makes it more clear. Do they need visuals? Because in your mind, here's the other thing. I haven't said this to anybody for a long time because I keep my clients along, that I don't have to train new people, but a lot of times people have more than half of the conversation going on in their head and only like 20% of it comes out. So you've got a full picture of what you want going on here and you've given instructions and they hear the instructions, but they don't see the whole picture. So that's where lists, examples, not that type of thing is helpful because now you've helped them get a picture and maybe they can't fully see the picture of what it is, but they can see a picture of what it's not because you gave examples.
00:56:44 - Michael’s iPhone
Okay. Esther literally had this conversation because of us about how I was like Whitsen, my manager and I were both that are Whitsen with this guy, and it was kind of like what you're saying. I was like, I don't know what's hard about this. Yeah. I was that was what I was saying and then so yeah we did come up with a checklist for him. It wasn't a happy ending. still didn't do it and actually we switched him in the clinic. He was supposed to be my guy to check my reports. Make sure that I had the prescriptions right, that the amorizer ordered and he was missing it and I'm like you had one job anyway. And so what we did is we switched him to a customer service role. So now he answers the phone, you know makes nice nice with my cuz my patients takes the message and now it's like ah this is like and we actually put someone different in the role that we know is more meticulous and so now they like she it's a she checks all the things that the reports need to have and then it's good. We haven't had a problem in like a month so but yeah I asked her literally it was like you you can't like you didn't even try with this dude like make something happen. And yeah, so I tried, I did try, but it wasn't a happy ending that time, but I could probably do better things like a yes, no list. I just tried to give them a task list.
00:58:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So good to great. That would be a good book. So that's talked about, it uses in terms of org charts, right butts in the right seat. So let's say you're driving a bus and there's a designated seat for each function in the business, you might have all the right people on the bus, but some of them are in the wrong seats. They're in the wrong roles. Like instead of a manager, he should have been customer service. Sometimes you just got the wrong people all together and they don't belong there at all. And that generally, culture thing could be company culture, values, things like that. So you innately, or with Esther's help, I'm not sure, figured it out and well, the manager, the manager, my manager actually was.
00:59:00 - Michael’s iPhone
like, hey, how will we try this instead of just firing him? And I was like, oh, yeah, because he met all the other boxes.
00:59:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's loyal.
00:59:06 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah, mean, him, I was in a month, right. Loyal, very friendly. And he met all the other boxes, he just wasn't doing this thing right.
00:59:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, a lot of things right.
00:59:20 - Michael’s iPhone
Awesome. I value loyalty lot.
00:59:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
yeah. And you should, and because you can't train loyalty. So, the other thing, and I know we're at time, but these are some of the things to look at. These are also levers, right? You can't, you can't train loyalty. You can't train integrity. You can train communication skills, but it's usually not worth it because it takes so long, because those are in-grain habits you're talking about a runway of years, which, you know, unless it's nepotism and you're trying to invest in a family member, for the most part, that's just not the best business choice to make. But you can train. skill level, you know, things like that. So if you've got somebody that's got all of the good things that you can't train, all the loyalty, all the integrity, they show up on time, they've got a great attitude and they're intelligent and they're trainable buying a place for that person, because you know what I mean? So yeah, okay, so you're gonna send me the meal macros for dinner and just add it to the reports and then we're gonna make a correlation with that and how you're sleeping. Sleeping seems to be improving. It could be Esther's letting you sleep in, it could be other things. So you're moving more, you're doing more, you just do more frequently and not only that, well, you weren't, but just knowing that you get to does something, it gives you something to look forward to. You know that there's an outlet that's coming, that does something instrumentally. Yeah. Yeah, I like to say it's borrowing energy from the future. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past. When you look forward to something you borrow energy from the future That's all I feel about it So anyway, we've got and and this is the energy You're already probably borrowing energy from the future knowing the cleaner and the babysitter and all of that stuff is coming You better send mark a picture Yes Help me pick it so he's Talking to Tina about the cars because he's like mark whatever Another car person he is though, and that's important and that matters what brings you joy brings you joy anyway okay, so Is there anything I mean again?
01:01:47 - Michael’s iPhone
Oh my last homework that I want to put down, but so I just wanted to make sure I I step my expectations, but I'm gonna talk to Esther about this is we're gonna make a list for the cleaners and my other and then the macros
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Email to you. I do want to put in our notes that I want to finish the business spreadsheet.
01:02:05 - Michael’s iPhone
You gave me like a month to do it, but I actually want to finish it this next week. So I want to finish the business spreadsheet and that's what I'll work on this week.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Awesome. And did you choose a time tracker?
01:02:20 - Michael’s iPhone
I haven't got that. I think I downloaded the toggle. Do you want me to work on that this week? Yeah, I do. I guess I'm fixed. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not really starting. I am starting on Wednesday like my work again. So I could do it.
01:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, that's what I'm trying to think about. Maybe maybe we start that in September and then we can just. Okay. What I want you to think about it, but really we want. You're just in this transition period and it's kind of invalid data. The whole point of it is. real data and we don't have a flow yet and the flow is going to drastically change probably in September. I don't know, maybe not. So that's what I need you to think about is how much it'll change or not, knowing that you're in a season of change that is going to continue to change. So take that into account and then you tell me when you think it's a time to go ahead and track it knowing that it is changing. Again, we're looking for anomaly, not necessarily anomalies but patterns and corollary data so that we have a type of assessment to be able to make and just have something to pick on for optimization because there's infinite things that we could pick on to work on and they make a difference but we want to pick the most leverage thing that's going to move the needle fastest and that starts with getting some data as a baseline first. So okay so I'm going to send you this stuff in Probably about 10, 15 minutes and then we'll work on it. But if any questions, thoughts, whatever come up through the week, you can always shoot me a message.
01:04:10 - Michael’s iPhone
Sounds great. Sorry to go over, but thank you for your time.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally fine. It's less about the specificity at the time and more about accomplishing what we're here for, so.
01:04:19 - Michael’s iPhone
Yeah.
01:04:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a wonderful meeting.
01:04:22 - Michael’s iPhone
Thank you for shifting. After this, we'll go back to the 10 AM if that's okay. Oh, yeah. It's just that weird moment. Yeah, and it should already be on the calendar, right?
01:04:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's correct. All right. I'll see you next week.

I was behind the camera, so I can't show you this, but I'm going to show you what I did and got home at midnight last night after having done. Hold on, cuz it was crazy, damn, where'd go, here, this, you have an iPhone so I can just send a bunch, use bunch of grandma's, well not everybody was a grandma, one was not a grandma, but I am. And now I have two grandchildren, let's see, this one and this. also that so that you can see we climbed a mountain yesterday at a top of a rock and there was legit rock climbing with no equipment and some of it was pure vertical and the only way I got up there was wedging myself between rocks and arm strength because I was too short to get the foot holds and hand holds that on that rock that mountain yes it was three and a half miles there and back and we watched the sunset on top of the mountain and we could see two volcano mountains from where we were that were a hundred miles away on one side and one hundred miles away on another side and then we climbed down in the dark with headlamp so I was in trumpet AF last night mmm that was a wild that was fun it was cool how to share Uh, hey, how did you talk to Lisa at all?
00:02:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

00:03:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. they were they were just trying to like like the like imagine Frank is like the blocks expert, right? So he's unlike the cutting edge of all that, right? And WordPress will like change the name of something and Frank adopts it immediately. He's like, oh, it's called this now. So like some of the some of the names we're using are not what they are now. So when he hears, but the word still is around.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It just has a new meaning.
00:03:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what we call a pattern, for instance, this is true, but let's say it is, what we call a pattern is now called a layout, and a pattern is now something else. So they got together and they said, hey, we think there's some confusion around, like we need to make sure we're on the same page about what these things mean, or make sure that we're all using this to correct terms, right, because we think that we say this, and it turns out they were right. So it was like, okay, so they got the same page about that. And then they brought him up to speed on some of the other stuff that he was confused about, like, hey, why are you using a cloud? Why do you want to use a cloud library for this? how are you doing this? Eric's like, I think we got it, like, we definitely got it now. he's like, I think he was impressed even more. was like, oh, okay, got it. So then they said, for now, like, ranks, sort of like coming at it from a long term approach, like, Hey, you know, when you have a hundred clients, you're gonna want to be have this. And he focuses sort of in there. And they're like, we appreciate that. But we want to, we need to be working on the short term rather than the long term.
00:05:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we work on the short term.
00:05:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And for us, the short term is being able to do XYZ, whatever. he's like, got it. Okay, yeah, it's like, it's not that we don't want to do what you're talking about. It's like, we don't need that now, we need that then. But let's do the now, now and then then. And then Eric today was like, he was like, Hey, I just want to let you know, like, if it would be possible to keep him around for like once a month calls, like once we get this stuff out of the way is like to keep him around as an advisor for some sort, he's like, I think that would be super beneficial. I said, sure.
00:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thinking about having. Yeah, more long term anyway.
00:06:01 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, no, okay, no, because I don't, I wouldn't assume that that was possible. So he never mentioned anything about like a monthly engagement or anything like that. All that he has said to me was, Hey, maybe maybe when we're done with this, you could help me sell my stuff. Or do you know how to do that? I'm how to do this. Maybe there's mean we can work either like that. And funnily enough, Eric was today, before I said this, Eric, Eric was like, man, if Frank used our stuff, he'd sell so much more of his course or whatever.
00:06:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's like his check out and all his stuff is terrible.
00:06:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But the code is good, right? So it's like, he's like, he's good at code, like really good. So that's the threat. So now they were like, this is what we want, we want to be able to do. These are the things, the problems that we have, let's resolve these problems. ones. So an example would be when we import a cloud template, make sure that it adopts all the styles, being able to set the global styles so that when you add a block or a gravity form or whatever, it adopts all of those. So that's what they're working on. And then showed him why it might not be the best solution for some of the that he's talking about, or we can do it like this. And he was like, oh, okay, yeah, that makes sense too. So yeah.
00:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, the goal is still to get wolf or done by October, okay. And the G4, the journey, how are we doing?
00:08:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there's something wrong with one of our plugins. have to, I set up a test yesterday because I implemented our lead tracking on CMA. I'm for sure getting leads from ads and what I'm seeing, those events are not firing in, oh, you know what it is, the GTM container. I have to go to the container. It's not finally the container.
00:08:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
think I just figured it out. What is CMA?
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The certified management accounting exam.
00:08:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:08:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we launched that site, whatever, like a year ago. It's. been steadily getting sales. So then I purposely tried to get leads. I'm getting like two or three leads a day right now. But they are not going up in Google Ads or Google Analytics. But I think I just can't a step. Do you know?
00:09:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you cannot, Dan. You cannot skip a step.
00:09:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I followed the swap that I created. I would have realized I'd skip a step and I'd just get it on the fly. Did you follow the process? I did not. No wonder I didn't work.
00:09:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did So what else in that journey, what else did you want? I don't know what else did you do related to G4.
00:10:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So Melissa is that she'll have all the stuff reviewed by the end of the day today. then she wanted to meet tomorrow. I'm not sure I can because I didn't think this stuff was tracking. But now I do think that stuff is tracking. So I need to go also saw something else weird yesterday that to go look at. Like there was an event firing in CMA that technically shouldn't be unless the way I defined it was URL based. And I said something like, hey, anytime a URL has SP in it, which would be a sales page, then do this. And if that's the case, then it would be correct. That is not the case that it's incorrect. And if that is the case, then I should have seen two other events and I didn't. So either the one event has messed up something's wrong, I think. So I have go look at that because the stuff that she's going to build is based off these three events firing on the sales page. But it would be that only a ninja because they just got a custom set up. It could and should be that they do fire on all sales pages across domains because they're not in any way product specific or page specific other than sales page is like this.
00:11:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The should only throw in a sales page.
00:11:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm going to go make sure that a they're actually all firing correctly on ninja CPA. And if they're not, then I can't be with her because they're needed to build the report. If they are, then I can be like, okay, yeah, let's jump on a call and do at least one. Let's just do that one. Just broken the fix.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still going to like the custom JavaScript version of his thing, which is custom JavaScript, which I do not do, but I'm going to learn how.
00:12:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. What does that allow you to do?
00:12:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think it's going to allow me to fire custom events based on custom documents, right? So the JavaScript says sort of like an if this, then that. If this happens, then fire writes out an example would be using that to fire my new customer event. So I'd say hey, if this is a new customer, then fire a new customer event. There's nothing built into GAPore or the GTN plugin or Woo that's made for that. So it's going to allow me to do this custom JavaScript.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll be interested to see what those events are and so if you can't do it in GA4 or custom JavaScript, can you give me an example of the event?
00:13:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because I think of that and think you can do it with custom JavaScript. It's not going to be a default event, so a default event in GA4 would be a form submit, they have a built-in event that I see firing that I didn't set up, so a custom event would be not default, it's not built-in at all, and then it's also you're defining it, right?
00:14:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, like for example, was it be scrolling to a certain page?
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it add the card? Is it add the card?
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, yeah, all those are all those are built in.
00:14:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's fine. Yeah. So it's outside of those and then it can be completely custom, like new customer. No one is going to be, I mean, I'm not going to say no one, but probably very few people have ever set up a new customer event. So that's going to be me waiting for the order transaction result page to hit. And then I'm going to do a look up in the blue. I'm going to say, is this a new customer or not? If yes, then fire this custom JavaScript and call it new customer. Like event is new underscore customer.
00:14:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my god, what purpose like just to know that this transaction was from somebody that you've never had before or like to what end is what I'm getting at.
00:14:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, so then. in GA4 I can say, show me new customer sources. I say, your new customers come from Google organic.
00:15:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you.
00:15:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Got you. Got you got you. Also, like, you know, then it would be like, you got this many new customers along the stuff that we already know, but it would be in that place too. And then, if I can do that look up and fire it into GA4, then I could also say, and go apply this tag in the infusion talk.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We used to work around with that with Infusionsoft and onto port with what we call the sandwich page. That was sandwiched between checkout and the thank you page, the landing page that the customer got to once they purchased. in the checkout page settings, you can always say, okay, where do they go after completion of checkout? so it would go to a sandwich page and all that was on there. was a pixel, a tracking pixel, and a redirect, a meta redirect, so that it happened, you know, within seconds. And so the customer never saw it because it's a blank white page, and it just looked like a page was loading. But that fired the pixel, and then it would go to their landing page, and it happened so quick that, you know, nobody was upset or bothered by it, but then it allowed us to get a fire, a pixel fired that wasn't built into any of the systems.
00:16:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, similar principle, except just JavaScript faster. Yeah, well, and you can do more, right, so I can like delay, I could send the event in the data layer after the fact, I can send it with everything else.
00:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that appending data is amazing. And I only seen that though, what JavaScript and jQuery.
00:16:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, same principle.
00:16:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's cool. love that. You're, this is a whole, I probably said it last week though, sharpening your saw and like, you can hire people for this stuff but not really well because people that do it as a job, do it as a job and their interest level is not optimized, it's not leverage, it's not simple, it's always bloated, it takes too long, it's not super refined, it's not as excellent as it can be whereas if you do it, even though it's working in your business, it's still working on your business because you're setting up the foundation for like, it's the vision, right? Basis is the the basis, that foundation tech stack that is, it's the tools but it's the systems and it's the processes and it's the methodology of using everything to it's fullest. It's potential, which is why Mercer will always have, you know, job security and you will end our business, however you want to look at it. But it's just such higher level than what almost everything else has done. It's the leverage. It's the data. It's clean data. It's fast data. It's attached data. It's data that tells the whole story from beginning to end so you can figure out what works, what doesn't work, how well it works, what works best, blah, Nobody else is going to do that like you would do it. So I'm glad you're doing it.
00:18:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. That's thing is like you can't, you can't measure what you don't know, right? It's like, I'm figuring out like, oh, yeah, want to measure. And then his custom JavaScript, so mine's like even more custom. And I can't, there's this, there's this idea that you can, you can take something like that and you can put it in as something else I can't remember the name of. But he's like, it's very rare that people use this, and I'm like, I have a feeling that's exactly what I'm going to need. And then his custom JavaScript is to do other things, like maybe you're combining events or you're defining your own where they scroll and stop plus 40 seconds. Like, I think you have to create a timer which JavaScript it does the 40 seconds. And they're like, okay, now fire it. So I'm getting into his stuff. But I think there's, and then I think once I go through his stuff, then, of course, that's going to make me go, Oh, I could do this, this and this too. Yeah, Lucy's, Lucy's working on the Lucy set up the creator user on form. It's working. We're making sure that doesn't break anything. He said, doesn't break anything. been live for like two days. Nothing's broken, but I know I haven't seen anything bad. And now I have to take the next step there is for me to get him to to insert custom meta on like I got to define the meta and then send it to them and say okay great create this meta so when they submit the form and you create the user also attach this meta magnet notes source whatever the source is in PGT I just have to look for and see like it'll probably like source not medium maybe campaign or keyword probably keyword oh and then Norio's gonna have to like I didn't know this but they've added utms so there's some new utms and then there's these new utms that have been added and then there's these other utms that are usable but not officially added that you know just allow you to and more data so Norio would have to like expand our plugin to include those, but we don't need them right now.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, one tab, there we go. yeah, so how's Noriel's stuff with high level and fan flow going?
00:21:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Uh, so he and I went around and around and there was some, so he has to sort of learn it, right, and then, but he gets to learn it, Ruby going, oh no, no, no. Go here, look at this, it does this, so he sort of gets short cut, only thing is to wait. Well, he doesn't really have to wait, right? By the time his email hits me his day is over and then when he wakes up the next day, he's got his answer provided I responded, and then lately he's been staying, he's screwed up later in the day, he was emailing me yesterday or he's working later because he was emailing me like definitely after her day was over but I think I got um everything he needs to get his first app working and then the the mod side or whatever the JD photos was named in their company the JD photos guy we we hooked up with them because they had the custom value updater that's how I found them so I paid 250 bucks to get access to their it's like lifetime access to their custom value updater but we keep running into it not working like intermittently and we don't really know it didn't work until somebody notices something's wrong kind of thing or something breaks essentially and then we'll trace it back and be like oh the values didn't get updated so those guys don't know when it breaks clearly we don't I don't know when it breaks, and then we hit them up and say, hey, this isn't working. So on the call of Monday, I'm like, man, this, when I was already thinking this, this doesn't work long-term. Long-term we need our own custom value updater, and we need one that would check, did the update occur? No, then run it again, or did the update, and if you can't, then it would send a message and say, custom values did not update something, something that would let someone know it's wrong. Ultimately, it would just not, it would just work or self-correct. So I hit up Norion, I was like, hey, I'm going to see if these guys will sell me their code. What do you need? And he's like, oh, you know, I need a walk-through or docs, and just that explains how it works, and he has seen some, he's seen the code that they write, and he's like, dude, their code's terrible. It's like it works, but it's not good. I'm like, not our concern at the moment, Norion. focus on the first part.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So he like used some of their code to write his app. And so he's like, yeah, we can we can do that. I hit up those guys and told I explained to him, hey, look, listen, breaks. We don't know when it breaks. Ultimately, we need to own our own version, and I buy a copy of your code. And then we'll move it to our server and, you know, do that. Like, I was like, let me ask the developers. And then he came back, he's like, yeah, sure, we can sell a few 700 bucks.
00:24:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Done. What?
00:24:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. So Stacy literally just sent them 700 bucks. And, uh, Nario just, I told Nario needs a loom. And, and then he's already worked with them to move code around. So they'll get it sent up on the server. And then Nario will tell me, I'll tell him what's wrong with it after the fact. We don't know when it doesn't work. So I'm sure he'll be like, that's easy.
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, typical, or real fashion. Um, okay. Hold on a second. Seriously, click over there. So like, what is the, I have to go back and look at my notes from last week. Hold on a second. Was all this week? No. Yeah. I don't have like, what are the targets for what Noreo is doing?
00:25:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Meaning.
00:25:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what do you, he's working on building fan flowy, right?
00:25:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's finishing the wedding, the, the wedding time. Yeah, but that's still, that's Abishik keeps finding like bugs and whatever. So there's, it's like true bugs and Noreo's fixing those and then there's nice to house or what if it. And the what if it did nice to haves are being Saved but not worked on so nor is just fixing the bugs and He got another round of those literally on Monday right right up to the meeting So he's like I'm not sure what I'm gonna be done. It's weeks, but he's like provide it He's like I thought Abhishek was done, but I literally just got an email with like five more So but he had talked to Abhishek about hey just yes, I want to hear it all and separate them like this And so they're doing that He's like man. He is good at finding this stuff and he really is So that will probably be done I would say by the end of September and Then Eric is talking to Norio about What to confirm is what we tell you about the summer day So we have the free wedding seating planner for epitome and then I bought the way of that So that's basically just a lead gen site and it's fill out this form and get access to our free win and seeding planner The idea being we generate leads they tell us engage pop up by Budget all the good stuff and then we give them access we limited access to Perfect wedding timeline just the seeding planner portion So Eric's needs to talk to Noria about okay, how do we do how are we doing that? It's gonna be a gravity form to what a webhook an API What and then once that function is worked out Greg's already done the design and then we'll just do like a super simple I mean problem. I mean I say a one-page site might legitimately mean it like there might be some Content pages that we do in the background that are for SEO, but like they're not in the nav Right, there's there's nothing for sale on that site It's just straight up you want to pre-winning seating planner popped in.
00:28:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I like that. And what is, do you have like a target date for that?
00:28:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I mean, we can't use it until the software is done. So we're going to try to, once we know the connection, then, I mean, I might look at like, it's like, what is a good, I'm sure there's one, I'm sure there's one from back in the day, where it's like just a pure lead gen site. Like to me, it's just like, that you're free-winning, like, and every email. And then of course, it'll just expose the other fields. So I might just look for like, what's the best opt-in site ever? Great, someone had like a free SDO analyzer, like back in the day, like crushed.
00:28:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Things just didn't.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It'll be something like that. I'm going to go find something like them and just do that. Fine. I mean, that will take Craig. 20 minutes, and it'll take like, and I'm still at the thing where I'm like, I don't want to build sites until this stupid thing is done. So there's also that. I'm interested to see like how far they get. I think they meet with Frank every, I think it's every week.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now they just back on top of vacation.
00:29:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:29:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Right. Oh, I have the notes about high level is raising third party integrations, but I just kind of left that hanging and I don't know. remember talking about it, but I don't remember.
00:30:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
scenario to review but it's not like unlocked yet you can't even what they do is they they release stuff in the lab so it's going to be in the lab I want to say like yeah I want to say it's like three weeks but there was some doc there was some documentation on it when I sent you to Norio okay and on Monday he's like all review it and like you know like sort of was like this is what I'm thinking like that it's going to be like another level of being able to integrate with it and I mean that's exactly what it sounded like so it's like beyond APIs I'm like I don't know what that really means that'd be interesting yeah I think it's that you can get access to like user ID and stuff that you can't get access to be just the API so we'll see um let's hold on a second
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, so the conversation about basically having the kind of menu items and what the team can provide when people request custom work or, you know, like what's the scope of support basically for basis customers, Bobbi was getting back at that and making sure that everybody's on the same page with that.
00:31:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Where is that at right now? I don't know. Did I not go to meeting on Monday? I missed it.
00:31:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, it had to be over within nine minutes because I went there. was like, holy crap, I snoozed the alarm one too many times because I was making lunch. I was like, oh, it's like night after. And then I dial in and there's nothing.
00:31:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We definitely didn't talk about it.
00:31:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Need to talk about it?
00:32:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't talk about it. mean, I know he was working on, but I don't know. don't know that I'll see if it should be a task somewhere. I don't ever go into work.
00:32:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to knows of. If she doesn't know of it, then it's probably not passed out, but we'll see. Just to make sure that it's getting traction. Oh, Brunchy, no more issues, only reset you with the last thing.
00:33:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we figured out the fact that if user logged in and creates an API, it's only visible to that user. It's not visible to anybody that has admin access to the account. So Heather had logged in and created an API key at one point. Ross had logged into their account, Ross had landed, logged in and created an API key at one point. I wish I could be J had logged into range. And then they were something, whatever, one of the sites and they'd created an API key. So then when Eric or whoever was going in and changing the API key and I'm replacing it on the site, there was always another API key that that person couldn't see. One way or the other. So there was Eric, he didn't see Abishik. He didn't see Abishik, he didn't see Eric, so it was Heather. She didn't see Eric, so there was Eric, he didn't see Heathers. So in essence, it was always an API key available. So when the one, you know, Heather and Ross and those guys, they're not working on the site. So what was happening was Eric would change the API key and whooper and it would still happen. We're like, how is this happening? We never understood how it was happening. It was because there was an exposed API, there was a compromised API key that was there that nobody essentially knew about. So now they've all been deleted. And then Only we are creating API keys and those like do not create API key and it's definitely quelled it almost completely but Wolfers We're trying to get them moved over to stripe and then brain tree still giving us a bunch of Like we're like we're not even using you guys anymore and they won't the account Because they're like your account is still at risk. We're not using it So it's not at risk and they're like you need to put capture on your checkout will unlock the account That was this morning like oh my god really So soon as that one gets out of risk they'll unlock the account and then proceed with the migration step but they have not done that yet and I think with Think with Reset you there were so few that they just manually migrated them or they're going into, but in the brain news off. So the other two are underway. They will hopefully be off within a week or less. And then we're done with brain tree.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was the most outcome. how is another 71 doing just any updates since last week?
00:36:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Actually the week part is the same at the weird part is. It's the same average of last year where last year we thought we're going to increase sales because they're changing the exam, right? Which now seems like maybe wasn't totally true. Maybe it was just, I mean, again, we don't have enough data, right? Because if you go back three years, you're in this COVID world. So we're like point, like point one off. So like, let's say last year we were averaging 30, 33 point or 34 sales a day or something. Right now, we're like 33.9, oh my God, so it's like nearly identical. And then that persisted through, well, that went well into December with this gigantic spike right before the exam was removed. So we don't know. We don't know what's gonna happen. We're just keeping on, keeping on. It's still just going to come down to where the new customers come from, especially where the new customers come from in 2025, or at least from May of this year forward where things sort of return to normal, but then more so in like, okay, this is normal. We're in a normal year. Where do these people come from? It's still going to come down to that. Even if we're just back on track or back, we're at this pace of like the best pace ever. I think we're up to like almost 4300 subscribers. It's still going to be like in order to grow this.
00:38:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to know where your customers come from. Right.
00:38:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
that's... We bought CMA exams.com, like a week, a week ago, two weeks ago. So I just was texting Bobby about that, so we're building that site. So now we'll have CPA exam.com, CMA exam.com, there isn't an equivalent for CPE, but we started getting some CPE sales, our renads for those, we started getting sales, but I'm not sure they're coming from there yet, but that'll be the thing, it's like, okay, once I can get all this tracking lined up and locked in, then we're gonna know. Oh, and the other, and then we figured out, I never thought about this before, so we started ranking for ethics exam, so the ethics exam is this exam that they have to take after they've passed all four sections, so it's like literally your final step before you get licensed, so we had ethics exam pages on CPA exam.com and then I noticed, I think it's like an off-sh of the other SEO that maybe those started ranking better, and then we've gotten an uptick in leads there, and then I was like, wait a minute, we could rank for all 50 states for those, and essentially you're gonna get a bunch of people that pass the exam with who knows who, I don't care. I don't care what you bought at this point, but I do know that you're gonna need CPE in the near future once you get your license, so that we have an ethics exam guide for all the states. So like, if we start SEOing that, then start pitching those people into CPE, that could probably work out. So Gert and those guys, we gave them, we bought like 25 SEO pages of them. We're like, hey, can we take four of those and do these four ethics exam pages, we just picked the top. Like, I know, I think we've picked Delaware for some reason. Oh, because it was the most representative what the content should look like. So we actually took one page, sent it to them. They're going to optimize that one. And then we're going to say, great, not going to these four based on the template you just came up with. So then they'll do California, Florida, Texas, New York.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's I mean, that just seems kind of like this similar type of stuff that we've been doing with Mark, which is leveraging more, don't know, sources, not necessary sources, but entry points. Yep, it is too. Yeah, the market increase and that those analytics like that systematic, detailed, accurate level, analytic stuff that you're working on and building is who else is doing that? else is doing that. Like I feel like you're going to exceed your goals quickly. I don't know what quickly is. can't quantify that, but I think that the pace will be like when you get there be like, damn, I don't like, look what happened.
00:42:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and it's all like, you know, whether you sell it or not, you, you know, just make more money.
00:42:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You were talking about getting back to your breathing stuff.
00:42:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did something else, but I did it on Mondays. What'd you do? Yeah. got it. It was this other sort of guided thing because I was at home. So I like, I can't really. was at home and I had the dogs when I can't really check out for an hour. So I was like, I could probably check out here in the hammock for 20 minutes. Mm-hmm, and it worked whatever was I forgot about it was one I'd never done But I was like, oh it was it was one that was like It's like a meditation to get in touch with your spiritual guide. I was like, I'll try that I found an audible weirdly enough Interesting I want to my thought about me either I've got like a gazillion audible credits lined up.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I proceeded to buy like five books Okay Snaps, Snaps I I'm scrolling back to obvious eight and it says that your peak in the past was 4,000 60 active subscribers and did you just tell me today?
00:44:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
at your 4300? Oh, no, the 4,060 is the proverbial glass ceiling.
00:44:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that year passed?
00:44:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, yeah, but I realized you can pass it, right, during your peak season. So my guess is, let's say, so yeah, we're passing. So let's say we, I think we hit that early July mid mid-July. I think we hit a mid-July. So from that day forward, my guess is if I take that number and the number on January 1st, the average will be 4060. It can't really be more than that because the math dictates. But can you exceed it right now? but then I also know in December, we will get three or four hundred cancellations. So let's say we get up to 44. for 100, which we may or may not, but whatever it is, we know there's going to be a mass exodus in December. And then if you were to average it out, your average is probably going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060. And Bobbi's like, we're past it. And I was like, yeah, that's true. But there's some missing something. And then I thought, oh, wait, yeah, of course you can exceed it.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But averages are basically not that. Well, that's going to be fun to see and interesting. It'll be funny, even if it's true, because the numbers, well, yeah.
00:45:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So the only thing that will change it is if the 33 remain, right? That's based on it being 31 average as well, right? So if the average is stays at 33, which we won't know until November, then you can exceed the 4060. Then it would be whatever I'd have to rerun the math and be like, okay, now it's 40 109 or whatever that
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is 33 being new, um, customers, right a day, uh, subscriptions, new subscription, not new customers, customer, the customers is a 21 or whatever we've always been using 21 and 31.
00:46:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Those, those are the ones that got us.
00:46:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I really want to, like, make this stand out so I can find this, that's easy because what I really would like to have for each of these projects, because my notes are weekly, right, and I go review and sometimes I copy and paste notes from the week before into next week's coming out or like save this for next week and just copy it so that I know I want to talk about But what would be really good is if while I'm talking, I've got the stats of whatever it is that we're working on because I have to keep a lot of that in my head or be able to scan through the notes quickly find it. Teamwork as a system for kind of tracking progress by itself isn't that great. probably just need to have like my own kind of stats spreadsheet. So I have this, so I'm not like asking that constantly and it's always staying in my head. It stays in your head because you're doing it all the time. But I ask better questions if it's in my head all the time also. And when I'm thinking about it throughout the week, I'm always thinking about these things throughout the week, then it's more effective too. So anyway, not to self, actually, I'm going to send that email to myself. And apparently the problem with email is not on the Y. That's weird. Oh, just because you have so many things going on, you're the only person that has so many things going on, but I have so many things going on and you have so many things going on. So that's a lot of my brain, which is low to my brain, and the nodes do help a lot, but I think that they could be better if I had those particular things, which are especially because the goal of being creating the market share increase, the value that we want to get to, like those are all the bullets that I want to have is like where we're at, when's the last time we measured and what are the things that are doing and just kind of, and I don't think you look at it quite the same way I'm talking about doing it. I think that it'd probably be helpful to you too, just to go like, oh yeah, it's actually this. And then what I know about your brain is when you see something more often than you would have put it in your face because you do have all the things going on. Your brain just goes light up and thinks of something else and then you go do something else. Incredible. And then come back like, what happens when I do this? So anyway, I will set that up. What is this? Oh, that was the new product for another 71 that you were talking about. You've launched that, right?
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No. met Melody was getting some pushback from Melody and she wanted to build it a certain way. I'm like, no, no, no. And then she's like, we need to talk about this. I attended the call and she explained it. And then when she was done talking, she was all like, this is it. I just said, wrong. It's like, that's to be rude. Wrong. He's like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we don't like this. And then I explained it to her and her and the other guy were like, yeah, we could do it that way. And then we all get what we want. Your way, I lose a lot. You gain a lot. And I lose a lot. This way we both don't lose. You gain what you want to gain. I gain what I want to gain. And it's all better off. So then they're like, then now they're going about building that, which is essentially it involved like re-architecting the tags. It's like a slight re-architecture. But but because it's across like six products and yadda yadda. and we had to remove a bunch of tags, they're like, all right, we're gonna go build it out and then, I'm right, I mean, I know I'm right, because I thought about it, I'm like, I'm right, this will work, and it will resolve a bunch of issues, so they're in the process of doing that re-architecture and creating the missing tags, and then writing down, okay, we're gonna get rid of these tags, and this is how we're gonna get rid of them, and then they hooked up, they hooked up a plugin yesterday that helps them, they're very concerned about like, people losing access when they have two subscriptions, which really isn't that big a deal, but even that will be resolved, and then part of the plan would also be to eliminate the infused Woo plugin, which their convinced is somehow causing some of these issues, which may or may not be true, and I was Like, that's fine, because I took portions of that away from that. I took portions of the functionality away and put it in Zapier, and it's worked fine, but we could use make, like, either or, um, so the plan is for them to get it all mapped out, built, essentially, and then, then we're going to figure out when we can launch it. And we're basically at, like, the price is going to be, like, 77 and 87, think. Jeff didn't want to do the 77. I'm like, we have to, because if nothing happens, we've done this for nothing.
00:52:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Remind me with the 77 and 87 are.
00:52:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do have that, but I didn't do it good that 77 a supplement 87 is full course, right? Okay. And we just had someone, this was online. like last week someone went on a Reddit and they started this thread and it was like do not buy me just cpa review it to rip off and it the guy was complaining that he was complaining about he was complaining that that didn't refund them or something it was like super super ready and then like a mild pile on started with this other guy that came in and then all these other people started commenting and it was just it's just so sad that it's so clear they think it's a supplement they think it's a supplement and then they also questioned the sixty seven dollars i'm like oh my god and then our people showed up the ninjas showed up and they're like what are you talking about like do the math If you buy a Becker for 3,000 if you buy a ninja and you take each second up to the three months at a time time 67 you're only spent you're spending less than a thousand dollars, and then they're like just the best I've never had a problem with him. He's the only person he's been in this industry forever He's the only person that comes right just the deluge of defenders and then I guess the mods came in They weren't around and they're like yeah, we're deleting this whole thing This is this person just joined reddit and their first thing is to to track and slag on one of the best cpa review courses There is delete they deleted the whole thing.
00:54:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you get the screens?
00:54:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's first no like I Was like it I was like on my phone To get well we have tons of those there's tons of those on on reddit So I do want to start using them on the new sales page because I think they're more powerful than yes You know testimonial block We have great ones. We have whole threads that just wave about us.
00:55:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but you for sure should be using them in your marketing.
00:55:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I don't. We have one that's literally called is Ninjacy. And this is like someone asking a question for real. Is Ninjacy Pay Review a scam? Like I couldn't have paid to have someone do that. We use it in our emails. In case you're wondering if Ninjacy Pay reviews a scam, go here. And it's all these people raving about it. We have this one dude on Reddit that's like are one of our biggest defenders. He's like, I passed all four sections using Ninja whenever, but his screen name is Nutella Nick. Oh, I know. I'm like, oh, buddy, it's hard to recognize you in marketing. Only because it's a trademark term, not no other reason.
00:55:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:55:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. But he showed up. He showed up and like went off like, this is .
00:56:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, but couldn't you use it and then just like black out parts of the username like and you.
00:56:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, no, we don't even need to use this. No, there's tons of them. But I want to use those instead of the, I mean, we created these testimonial blocks. But I'm like, and we have like the Reddit logo. I'm man, we should be using just straight screen caps of those. And then, and then them in those locations, rather than us cutting pasting the actual thing and linking to it. Like we'll cut and paste and then link to the actual thing. But no one's probably clicking through. mean, that's something I can look at. But I doubt people are clicking through. Whereas they, if they see it's from Reddit, just from the, like literally like a better and then videos. It's like, okay, those are probably your two. best but i can split test this video testimonials yeah we use those those totally work i was just about to ask you about them because i think that like we have tons do you have a social media account or you just share that stuff regularly uh we i run them as ads on facebook this one this girl made is so good oh like oh my god you couldn't it's like it's like she made it on purpose but he didn't right and she sent it to us and we turned into an ad where do you stockpile your testimonials the video ones are in this service called boast and then the text ones we don't even gather anymore we just have so many it's ridiculous yeah but you should keep them current uh i mean they're not I don't think the date. I don't think we put dates on the testimonials. Um, any of them, really.
00:58:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think I don't even think we gather.
00:58:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, we gather them on the cancel. So they do, they do updates. I just haven't used a new one recently. Sometimes I'll you, I'll check out the video ones and maybe I'll swap in the video one here and there. Uh, but I try to let, you know, I'm trying to get someone that's like, they use Becker. They, they're a ninja only, right? I can only use like so many. Like I was with Becker and then this, right? So it's like, okay. and then I ran some of his ads and like you see which ones did good as ads, then I put them on the landing page and then I ran a test on the landing page at which one do people watch the most and I made that one first. Did you like that?
00:58:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wish that we got to do another 71 completely separately because I I would so love to drive growth there, that would pay, would love to drop growth there too, hopefully I'll be able to do that as soon as the stupid tracking is worked out because I don't know how to drive growth there. I have so many ideas and there's stuff that you touch but not systematically. But once you get that set up, we'd be able to track everything. But it needs to be set up because I literally just been throwing stuff at the wall for years.
00:59:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm still convinced I could turn off all the ads and nothing would happen. Or it would happen but it would take six months. I'm like, I don't want to find out that way.
00:59:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Gosh, it's crazy just thinking about, first of all, it was seven years ago, and then you're like, I don't do email. I'm like, it doesn't work. I know, I know, look at that. And then maybe you might still be right. But regardless, the thing is, we've watched, we've learned it together with Mark is that there is a, you know, having multiple, so for him, it's vendors. For you, I think it would be channels, ad channels. Oh, yeah, like a formal approach and multiple tactics to what you're applying on those channels that don't in and of themselves make huge differences. But the compounding effect are like, first of all, anytime things dip, you don't really dip, you don't even feel it because everything else just kind of buoyed it up. But yeah, but the analytics portion of it is to be able to have very clear, reliable data is huge. And just
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
all the things that you've learned over the years anyway adding adding into that anyway that's awesome holy crap how's it 105 i could just whatever toy flies okay wait so meditations we're good you're taking care of you sound good found the good you've only just got her moving date so we gotta go visit the campus and then she moves in on his two day 2021 20 is a Friday i'm like probably moving in on the 21st that's a temper yeah she got her dorm assignment she's gonna have two roommates and a expert large triple and everything i mean it's the oh she told me the name of the building it's like an author's last name no i think it's a hog So I think can tag another, I don't think that is another, so the HAG haul, I guess, and I don't know what the hell is up with college right now, but you want to talk about a light schedule. I was like, you're kidding. That's it.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like four classes, period. What? That's it. That's it. And they're on the quarter system. So it's 10 weeks. And we have four classes, 10 weeks, and then 10 weeks. I don't know if some of them carry over, they're two quarter classes or whatever, but she's like maxed out on credits, which is like, I literally can't take anymore. She's like one credit guy, I'm like the total max, and that's four classes or something. And then her earliest classes at eight and her latest classes at eight p.m.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
01:02:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But also also.
01:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a wide.
01:03:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
breath yeah so what's she taking on that like what's her major bio no biology microbiology okay how far away is she doing the school yeah it's eight hours drive uh it's an hour of life hour now how is Denise doing i'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking able and leaving really yes yeah you don't need the care i'm like for though i just look at it as part of life i mean it's what happens unfortunately things move forward where we march on it's going to be interesting how mario handles not having a sister around even if they don't get along you what she's already acting weird yeah it's it's hard i don't know if it's related, but it's like, I think it might be.
01:04:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they're they're talking, they've been talking more than ever the last like two months.
01:04:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, like amongst themselves or whatever. And she's definitely over the I hate Evelyn face. I wasn't that long, but it would be had for a while. Yeah. then, yeah, so it'll be interesting see how her and Denise react.
01:04:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and you revolve car, you need the ocean, and you need to figure out how to keep those two happy, because this is going to be very hard for them.
01:04:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, I, whereas I was like, you know, she apparently, so Jenny DeRoz went to the school to UC Santa Cruz. And I don't know what I said to her, but she's like, Oh, yeah, no, like, you're only guaranteed housing your first semester. And then the second semester, it's like hit or miss, or your first year, you have to live on campus for year, you can't have a car. And then your second year, you can apply to live on campus. But it like hit her mess. She's like, it's like, she said when she was gone, there was like a borderline crisis to get housing. And then everyone's like, no, it's still like that. Like everyone's saying like getting housing the second year. So then you have to get off campus. And Jenny's like, when we went to go off campus, she's like, I literally, you need a dossier on yourself to get the gut housing. And then we go apply for it. 50 people are applying. And then it's like hit her mess. And of course, my takeaway is like, oh, I should buy two bedroom condo and Santa Cruz, little mirroring.
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that play.
01:05:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like, that's the entrepreneurial take is property. Right. I'm gonna, if I'm gonna pay rent or, or boarding to the school, why wouldn't I just pay to myself? Right.
01:05:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm paying it either way.
01:05:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. like, I should go to, so a two bedroom condo. 800 grand, so I'm like, hmm, let's see how this election pans. I got about a year. like, can hit the fan between it's gonna hit the fan soon. What? they just revive, you see that the labor, the jobs, number revision that they just did, they're like, oops, turns out we were over by 800,000. You're kidding. Really? So that, until that, so that was like two, three days ago, leading up to that, and still even yesterday, people were talking about, oh, bed's gonna lower the rates. Well, part of the way they do that is they're using employment or rather unemployment as like a leading indicator. So it's like, they're like, unemployment's good, so you can lower the rates, is sort of already. And it's like, hmm, but if that number It was run by 800,000. Isn't this other number wrong? Like, isn't this leading indicator fake balls incorrect? Well, it's like, yes, but if they so they lower the rates, I mean, it sort of where this if you I was someone would show these charts, like the parallel between what's happening right now and like the two right before the 2008 crash is like very similar. A lot of the indicators look the same. So it's like, why wouldn't it go that way? And then lowering the rate. People are like, you know, a lot of financial people are like, you can't lower these rates. Like, you can't do that. You could trigger a much worse outcome. Ron doesn't say the whole time. There's no way this ranks. She's like, there's no way. There's no way that they keep saying soft landing. She's like, I don't see it. I don't see how it's possible. You have to pull a rabbit out of a hat. She's like, I don't believe it. I don't believe this is real and I would come in due time, like it's either it's going to happen, and then that would be like this quarter, right? They do. They only meet once a quarter. That meeting's probably in the next couple weeks. So they're either going to do it or they're not. And then the markets will react based on that. And we'll see. And then God only knows what happens with this election.
01:08:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't want this. I don't want either one of them. But here's the thing about Trump is like, we know who he represents him. He represents who he is, what he is. We know his pattern. We know his MO because he's a steady douchebag. But like what his strengths are, we have some definitely definite economical power, There's there's some good.
01:08:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's disgusting.
01:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's right. Kamala is a puppet. Like she we don't I don't even know who she represents. I don't know what she represents. Somebody's behind her, now no idea who it is. I don't know what their MO is. I don't know anything about that. so she is a wild card that puts us at huge risk. And we have no idea. But why I think she'll win, which I don't want, but why I think she'll win, is because I think she will bring out the female and black voters just because she's woman and black, and that between the two of them, that's a population that has been largely just like, if everybody, I don't really care. I think a lot of females that never voted well now. And same with black people. And I think, and especially looking at the stats right now, how amazing she's doing, which is, again, terrifying. She's stupid. She doesn't know what she's doing. She doesn't stand for anything. And I don't know who's behind her. That's the most, yeah. So like in terms of like business and needing to create as much. Like I want to get to being able to rent my house out, buy another one, like have some property investments as soon as possible. There's no solid guaranteed investment, but the one thing about like in my church, we do food stores. I'm like, I'm gonna have property stores. If I meet family to live, you know, it can either make me money or it can house my people, but one way or the other, like that's where I want to start with it. Like yeah, kids. So okay, let me get back to your Denise Rowland for a second and the girls eight hours away, holy crap, you should buy the property. She is gonna hit the fan. I'm so glad that you're doing the work of the analytics right now because that foundation, like as she hits the fan, there are, and this is why I teach what I teach, it's fundamentals, right? There are certain types of things, clean, accurate data so that you Because a lot of people are going to be trying to guess and figure out what to do, and you're going to have the ability to know what to do, plus all the things that you've already built, the systems, the teams, the reputation, having had a very smart offer for a while now, especially with it being the subscription model that you already paid the price for, all the dip and finances. There's so many things that you've been doing, and we knew that the recession was coming. It took longer than most people, most of the analysts, most of the VCs thought it was going to take because they pumped money in, but we knew it was going to happen. And it gave you enough time to do such a good work, but I don't like, I mean, you might feel a dip, but it's not going to hurt you at all.
01:11:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Why don't you think that will be a dip because in 2008, I went and looked at this at one point. randomly because of David in 2008 when that uncertainty enters right it's not going to help it helps his business because people are like I need to get a new job right I need to they also retreat to education so they go my domain and yours so they retreat to education and there was like a we got a bump a noticeable bump back then and we didn't have our own product so it was like oh that's interesting and you could see I look up here I think I looked at search day I looked at a bunch of stuff I was like oh that's interesting plus we the if a pandemic didn't take us out pretty sure research is not like it was like they shut
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
down the entire business and it was like and we made it yeah that's it's crazy but it's awesome also if i can just get through whatever the it's just the having taken care of everybody so long getting myself so far in debt trying to do that when i get this going and all the data that i have with it like i don't worry about anything also because of the investing that i'll do but like there's so many there's so much volatility for so many people which is why i'm helping three other families but it's it's scary for other people and then i'm going to see so many people i care about just struggling because they're already struggling because things are so expensive but it's also amazing to me what being strategic and consistent can do for people yeah yeah anyway all right well good job I'm so glad you're doing the GA4 stuff. I cannot state that enough. It is so important.
01:14:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Anyway, good job.
01:14:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really make some good plans for Mario and Denise and Evelyn too, although she's probably going to be having fun, but then she's also going to get very homesick and that you're going to be in the middle of all of that. Good luck.
01:14:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do think it's great. Here's the silver lining. If you time it rightly, that's a word.
01:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:14:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It actually is a word. That's the right way. You can like a flight to San Jose is like 60 bucks. So I was looking at that in my company. That's what we doable. So you could go visit her at the drop of a hat and it's not going to, right? Like 45 minute drive. Easy peasy. Like you could do that in the day anytime. Anytime you wanted, um, which was not the case for my parents playing from Boston to DC there in the sixty nine dollars life Made major of airports. You could just show Denise all the things that are on the table because she still doesn't really get like what you're Doing this. Yeah, we're gonna go. We're gonna go visit now because now we can go visit I was hoping it would play out like this. I go. Okay, great. I can buy a flight for like next Wednesday We fly up in there in the morning running a car driving the campus ago. This is your dorm This is where your first class is.
01:15:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this.
01:15:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
This is that We're looking at like theirs target. Okay, great because we're gonna be here in two weeks doing this. Yeah, we're three weeks doing this again.
01:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, good. They're gonna do good, but keep using that brain of yours for Building your family because this transition period sucks. It's hard But it's better when you're when you when you do the planning and when you do all this stuff. they're just going to need you. That's all I'm telling you. They're going to need your even killed and an entrepreneur. We solve these things.
01:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, that bothers you. Let's fix that. Goodness. No parking. We're at the office. He's like, something's here.
01:16:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You took her to the office.
01:16:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Someone was supposed to be here. I mean, Eric and Stacy, and then I was like, can't be at home. Someone else was supposed to come out of office, who I think just, if it's them, I'm going to be surprised that you knew it was somebody else. Because Eric and Stacy, walking around the whole time, you haven't made a sound. I guess this is the other person's here.
01:16:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have, Zinni or Bell? Bells. All right, so I will let you go figure out who that is and I will talk to you Monday.

Pontune. Pontune? Yeah.
00:00:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And so we always go to the beach at the end. And we used to rent a boat on the lake several times, but our lake has been volcanic, I think. So there's a volcano nearby. There is lava rock all around, but it's so purec right now and the fish are dead and the lake is hot. So that map to me is as I'm not going there.
00:01:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So. Wow. Yeah. Let's say that's a new, a new one. It's a new thing to deal with volcanic.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not for my area. I mean, because we've got Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Shasta, all, you know, is Shasta is visible to me. And then the mountain by this lake is called Mount McLaughlin. So yeah, we're in the Ring of Fire.

Hanging out in Oregon. Yeah. Had a buddy who moved out there. Wow. his wife and before they had a kid. No. No, they had a baby and I went and stayed with them for a week and Took me skiing, which I didn't know how to do and it was all ice So yeah, I made a I mean one run where I didn't fall Yeah, it's not as easy as it looks Now there is this business where do you own but you're kind of killing it right now Yeah, um I'm really like accepting or accepting is that the worry. Yeah, excepting we'll go with it like Getting comfortable with the idea of like Like what I like I'm good at writing. I Can I can go in to? know a legit business and I can make an impact with What I do with copywriting and I was just thinking like I always had this mentality growing up of like you know, go get a job, go work. And I was like, working is just what I know how to do. And so I, you know, I'm looking at the stuff I'm doing with Tim and the Jim and getting five grand there. And then I've got another potential client in the, that I mentioned in the conservative political space that I think it'd be a lot of fun to work with. And they're interested in meeting with me. I know them really well through Brian. So, you know, I have no idea what that budget is, but whatever if it's not them, I feel like, well, somebody else I could find to do another five grand a month. And I was just thinking like, you know, I kind of like just going in, having a really defined scope of what I'm doing, focusing on that, and getting paid, you know, feels like a really attainable at least for now, like, putting together, like, like being the face of a product, or putting something out there that I'm, that I'm selling, for, at this point, in my life, like, I feel, I feel really just comfortable selling other other people's stuff for them, like, I'll admit, like, I probably have a, a block on selling. My own stuff, especially if I'm the face of it, and I'm open to moving past that, but at the same time it's like this other skill set of just doing copywriting for people can make me get money and I enjoy it. And yeah, the idea that I was thinking, the term was like, I know how to work like a blue collar person, and you know, because that's what I grew up around, and I was like, what if I just start taking more of that mentality, like an elevated blue collar type of approach where I go and I'm a workhorse, I can still set my hours, I work, you know, five or six hours a day, and it's a manageable schedule, I still set my own hours, and So, yeah, I'm just kind of like, that feels like in the strike zone for me, um, no.
00:06:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a hard stop at 1230 or whatever time it is for you to 30?
00:06:16 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
No, it's, no, it's 142 for me. I've got to take my dogs to the groomers at three. So, I've got, I've got like an hour. Okay.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just want to make sure that we can go through everything, but I just want to maybe think about the language a little bit because all, all words have connotations to them. Yeah. One with blue collar is kind of grunt worker and low value. Yeah. It depends on who you're talking to, right? Amongst the blue collar people, they're like, you know, I'm innocent to work early. you know, and anybody that pays attention to the economy knows that there's a shortage of laborers, skilled laborers. But you're, so there's a couple of things to it. One is that you just, you get things done. So what I would say, and again, there's so many parallels with us in how you serve and how I serve. What I've been called, I think before I even called myself that, then it was Ryan Maran pointed it out, and it's driving. I'm a driver. get things done. I can be driving myself, driving the project, but it's the energy and the momentum behind that word, but it connotation to it.
00:07:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Do you know what I mean?
00:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. The other thing that, And I think that this is something we could probably start to help you put some meat on and create a framework, which is something I never really did well because I really kind of custom tailored around people. But now that I've been doing it for so long, I realize that there is a plan, there is a strategy like semi modules. For example, to give you is I've got principles and priorities, know, I have to go even look them up. That's how I know what they are and we go through them, but thinking about them chronologically. So principles and priorities, and then it goes into finances, and then it goes to time tracking, and then we go into project management, and then we go into teams. And then we go into hiring teams, and then it's sharp in your saw and kind of mindset and things like that. And then it's iterative, constantly, right? But the reason we kind of start there is because principles informally, priority, priority informs what gets done. And the reason we go to our finances next is because finances let you know what you need to be gunning for, what you can do, what you can't do. Then we get into time because money had to dictate what our resources are before we even think about how we spend our time. But also priorities had to be dictated before we could even think about our times, you know what I mean? So then we get into project management. Okay, now we know what's important to us, we know what we can afford, we know what we need to set as a target so that we can get to the team that we want to work on. And now we know where we're going to spend our time, let's structure it, let's get it into a project management suite. Okay, now that we've got that, who are we hiring, what's our dream team? And it could just be one person that we're starting anyway, but I do kind of have a systematic approach now. Not everybody is at the same place in that conversation has nuance of. looks a little different but really it's not and the reason that it looks different is because of values and priorities and things like that so budgets you know and things like working in front of the screen working behind the scene kind of thing you know things like what's your conversion right right how many eyeballs you're getting on your offer what is your offer how big is your audience list how many offers have you even made to them how long have they been sitting there not getting an offer um you know did you did you just give them one offer and it was way up here did you try down here did you ascend them like there's a whole lot of things that can happen kind of chronologically and so you go through that going oh you missed this spot let's come back here you missed this you know what i mean or you did this but it was we don't have clear data we have data but it wasn't well or you made this change since the last time you did this this. So systematically approaching all the things that you know how to do. Now, if you built that into a written down framework of these are all the things that I'm going to look at because you just do it automatically.
00:11:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
It's in your head.
00:11:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do the same things. But I haven't really up until now, which is what I'm working on. sat there and documented these are all the levers I'm always looking for in the business.
00:11:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I've been doing it in my head.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times that I tell you, Chris, get it out of your head. You need the document in it. So taking my own advice. But that's where your power is. So back to kind of blue collar.
00:11:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's not blue collar work.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's power. And one of the other types of descriptions I've given is I'm a surgeon. I make surgical because I'm not going in there and like, you know, blowing everything up or I'm not pumping you full of drugs that are systemic, right? I'm going to the pain points. We are only going to fix the pain point. We're going to make the least. of damage to the body possible, right? So, and that's where, what is the word? Freedom and cash fastest path, the tip of the time, okay? Fastest path to cash and fastest path to freedom, where they intersect is where we make the most of money in the least amount of time, that's a precision cut. So, you kind of do the same thing because offers our precision cuts.
00:12:26 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:12:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We are not changing your whole business. We're not overhauling the website that you're on. We're not overhauling your tech stack. We're not overhauling your team. We're not overhauling the products that you've created. We're taking everything that you have as existing assets, if possible, and improving the offers made with the existing assets or looking for how can we repurpose the asset into, switch it, or what's a supplementary or complement. entry offer that you can make. From everything that you've ever done with Brian and everything I've seen you do for yourself and other people, those are the precision cuts that you make. So that offers, what I would love to do is just kind of go through your paragraphs section by section and kind of try to do that for you, right? Precision cuts, what can we do to improve that? I would like to talk mostly about your opportunities to make sure that because one thing I think that you can still have help with is you're an offer king except for when it comes to making your own offer as a consultant. What I would like you to do is pretend you are somebody else, okay? So you're not pitching yourself. No, like write it down and you can give him an avatar or something else if you need to mentally disconnect so that you don't. getting that ego thing. Yeah, like, I know everything about this guy. This is what he does. This is what he brings to the table. This is this business. This is how this guy is gonna just help it. And this is what it's worth. And now you're gonna make that pitch on behalf of him, which is you, right? be like, this, this is a no brainer. So if you don't have a brain and you don't So you go and look at the odds that I'm going to be able to get you a 5% lift. If I do this and you support me doing this, I mean, the odds are very small that that fails. You know, if you want to give a guarantee, you don't or in the guarantee could be, I'll say until I get that lift provided, you show up, you provide whatever you're supposed to provide that how confident I am. so I'm not going to give you a money back guarantee because that's my time. But I'll commit my time until we win because I see your stuff is that good, so I'm I'm believing in you and I'm not just asking you to believe in me, but that's how much I'm believing in your stuff is that I'll commit my time guaranteed until we get X results, right, right.
00:15:17 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
People are going to know that most people won't. Yeah, that that's a interesting mental exercise to create a software for for somebody else because I I was reading about people are doing these they call it they call it product highest services basically like design joy is the one who who really the first place I came across it is just a designer that that sells his design services for flat flat fees got a very like clear process before you buy, how it works, like, you know, I'm going to work on one thing for you at time. So that it's not like stacking up, like this is how we're going to work together type of thing. And it's like, you know, I think he's five grand a month. And then and then there are a got a list of other companies that are doing this similar model of productizing their services. I've got some copywriters who are doing that as well. And I was thinking about that around because the thing that I'm I think the thing that I'm best at is email copy. I do long form. I mean, I've written two sales letters for 10, like in really short, short order, one of them. did really well. other one, the offer wasn't as good. He's gonna end up doing a little over 10 grand on that one. But the first one, you know, he did 75 grand and that was a much stronger offer. And so yeah, I'm following what you're saying and I'm thinking about like a way to sell consulting services because I mean really like what I what I really want is to be at place where I'm investing the money that that comes in into cash flowing investments that that pay me you know eventually we'll be able to replace the income that I want to make. make. that's always been sort of what I've had in my mind of like, this is what I want to do. And the way that I've always tried to go about doing that is by trying to put myself in the role of, you know, a specific way to do business, like launching and releasing products. And which, you know, is not out of the realm of possibility for me, but just like right now in the near term, I'm, you know, Brian talks about, like, you got to follow the anecdotal evidence. And right now, the anecdotal evidence is, you know, doing these consulting gigs is bringing in cash. And so it's just got my mind thinking that maybe I need to rethink that whole The whole idea of consulting, whereas for so long, I've seen it as a time for money treadmill. But if I think in terms of a decade, like 10 years, if I were to do this for 10 years, I'm you know, after 10 years, like that's, how old is Grady? Grady's 13.
00:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How? How's he that old?
00:19:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's an eighth grade. Oh my gosh.
00:19:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
This year.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, something just along those lines of what you're thinking about, and obviously everybody's different, but I find that my resistance to being out in front is shifting now that I'm getting
00:20:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
getting near the emptying nesting.
00:20:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I wonder how much of that was self-preservation was also family protection. There's a different amount of pressure, and also there's such a thing as internet famous. mean, going into a marketing conference and being recognized, that was a very long time. That was 11 years ago, 12 years ago. And I was barely online. And now, you know, the world is much smaller, and we get there faster with TikTok and YouTube. if you're going to create new content, it's going to go everywhere. So if you're a face, you're a face. And that brings a whole new level of theme that I think naturally, protectively, we don't want our families to deal with. And it does take focus away because we feel. extra level of responsibility to our fans, our audience, our customers, whatever. And they feel an entitlement to the people that they engage with like, where are you? What's going on? Like, that's a whole nother of emotional estimate that I think maybe we don't consciously think about as much as we subconsciously go. You have no, no, no needed, don't want it. And I think that we have both kind of observed that there tends to be a little bit of an ego thing that goes on with a lot of people that are faces that maybe we're trying to protect ourselves against not wanting to be that person. And that, but that has a correlation to the same thing with money. Like, when you don't have money, you tell yourself that having money is bad. And that you don't want to do it because you'll be bad. but money doesn't change people. just amplifies what they are and they get, you know, they reveal it faster. So, Anyway, the thing about the 10 years thing, Grady will be grown, Madeleine will be grown, and into college, that's a whole exit runway there, giving you guys time to, because of course you could always shorten that if you wanted to, with that plan, you're now getting them set up in new houses, going to college, that stuff's expensive, and they in a different kind of way, like really being physically present when they're little, you know, they can go off and play for a little while, but now they're like, they know if you're paying attention to them, they know if you're really invested and available and all that stuff. So anyway, here's what I love about that plan for you. That's what I love about it, but the other thing is, it comes down to the boundaries, which is the conversation we've been having a lot, right? So you used to have a habit, which I think that you're very much getting out of, which is... If I'm here, I have to take care of everything because if I see a problem, I got to fix the problem and If I see the problem I'm accountable for the problem and it should probably come out of my own pocket And because I'm a partner or you know what I mean?
00:23:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Like you took a lot of things on you that didn't belong on you.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, sure Yes, but not just Brian. It happened in it with the lease stuff. Um, I think it happened with I want to say Tim It it one of your first consulting jobs.
00:23:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Oh Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom.
00:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, um, yeah because I I You are prone to feel a sense of obligation to something that isn't yours and I think partly out of fear of Maybe just just because you saw it. Maybe it's just because you saw it. So you feel accountable for it Side to comprehend the value and know that you're there to help. And so I think I'm the one that has to help with everything. Anyway, I think that that's what really bogged you down the most is because you can't do all of that. You were getting paid to do all of that. And now because you've created two things, really powerful things that I don't think really existed for you before, like when we first met with Brian and anything since, until around this year, last, last whole year, not just calendar year, and that is boundaries and leverage. So a very more defined scope of support that you both expressed and kept to that that's the important part kept to you. And then the leverage was in that scope of support that also it was that I'm doing this thing specifically. That's all I'm doing. This is the power of it. this is the value of it, this is what it's supposed to bring to the table for you, for me, that like you and the business and your partners. And so, as long as you not only keep doing that but improve that, if you continue to optimize that, your capacity to consult and have an impact and continue to be paid, the other factor is that lever is only as powerful as the way it can lift and the reward it can bring. So, if the person you're working for right now that you did those sales letters, the gym, I can't think of this, that's Tim. And Tom 10, that's how I get it. impact was able to be made because of his resources, because of his instruction. So you were able to plug into something powerful. So that's the other thing is, If you're going to try to help somebody that has almost nothing as a business, it doesn't matter how powerful your step is, they don't have powerful stuff to plug into, know, a 2% increase to $200, 2% increase to $2 million is, you know what I mean? So if you take all of those things into account when you are making those offers, you know, the leverage power, the reward, and also the risk for the drain and everything, that gets mitigated and the reward gets maximized. Yeah, probably all the things you're already thinking about, but I just want to add the support to it and say yes to it.
00:26:43 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, I think like I'm comfortable now with like the idea of like my minimum is, you know, at least 5 grand a month, so that, and I get there, there are a lot of ways to get But for me, I get there just mentally of like, I'm involved in, you know, a couple other things. so if I'm going to take my time to focus on something else, like it's got to be paying me this amount of money. And, and that'll serve as a, that'll serve as a nice filter for people too. But, yeah, I mean, I think, I think adding another consulting client in the other, the other unknown is with this, this tea thing. I spoke to, to Jim yesterday, and he owes me, I'll say he owes me an update by tomorrow. Apparently, the issue there is like, there's, They've got this Microsoft server that their pages are built on and the pages are not loading because of some server area, server error, so they've got this IT guy that they work with. So he's like, I'm going to get these pages up and loading this week and then I'm going to move everything over to Linux server, he's like I'm done with Microsoft. So I mean, it's a technical issue that I like that's more technical than I know what to do with when you're talking about server performance and issues.
00:28:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you said Microsoft server and I was like, what are pages, you've heard said pages, but now I'm thinking more like Windows NT or something like that. Anyway, totally irrelevant.

Definitely out of Got it. Yeah. and that's, so I don't fully understand the issue, but I believe Jim, like I don't get the sense that, like he's, I don't get the sense like there's anything nefarious going on here, and it's not like they have any leverage to do anything anyway, but.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, now what does he do?
00:29:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's his business? So, Jim is John's son and.
00:29:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, oh, this, these are the tea. These are the tea.
00:29:53 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay. Okay.
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's something else in his business is having issues. Like, how does it, does this affect you or just says something keeping him busy?
00:30:05 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, it affects me in the sense of like these, these pages, these sales pages that John wrote. And I'm more or less copy chief, but John wrote the upsell pages. Because of whatever server issue is happening, like they're not, they're not loading. Um, so they're hosting? It, they keep using the word server. Um, it's, it sounds like, it sounds like a hosting issue.
00:30:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, but, um, originally you had the T domain, you had all of that stack. Oh, well now it's on click bank, right? So can you give me the tech stack real quick? Just kind of like where it was before, where it is now, what changed?
00:30:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Um, the offer will be on click bank. So, clipping handles the payment processing, but the actual pages are your pages that you host on your own.
00:31:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you used to host your own staff, so he took over all of that now?
00:31:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, they, so they're not using any of the hosting that I had on the, for the tea before, because the way that we're selling the tea is, is with an existing offer that they have on, on click bank, and it's, it's called a new, new body, it's a, it's like a health and wellness fitness offer for people, loose fat, build muscle like anything, because that's John's back. ground. And so the upsell for the T is going to be shown to those buyers initially to solve the traffic issue of not having to go out and build an ad campaign to start so we can get cash flowing in that then we can reinvest back into coal traffic and that type of thing. So the click bank is handling the payment processing and then I guess the pages, the pages are not loading or they're not floating quickly enough for whatever technical reason is going on with this, they keep using the word Microsoft server. So maybe it's a server inside their hosting. I don't know what they're using.
00:33:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, or the other way around hosting on a server because every site that we have is on a server somewhere.
00:33:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right, right. So. Okay, then the. So those are the main two pieces attack the clipping payment processing in their hosting slash server that are in place and there's an issue with the hosting server. then after after the purchase happens, we're using ship station to handle the fulfillment. to, uh, to the folks up in, in Rochester.
00:34:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, just to adjust an upsell to their stuff. Mm hmm. Okay.
00:34:13 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. I'm click bank and they, and they have, um, you know, five to 7,000 people come through that funnel every month. So it's a, it's a good. Um, you know, it's not a huge, but it's a decent stream of traffic to put this offer in front of, and, uh, for the purposes of testing and acquiring customers, you know.
00:34:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much you want to be involved in, and what you want to know because your bottlenecked by this. It's not your primary business. Um, I were going to be involved at all, I would want I know, where is it hosted? Why are you using, like, is this a personal server? Is this, I mean, because there are, you know, mom and pop shop servers and hosting services. And, but you didn't specify that in a contract. And any of that type of stuff, and it behooves them to get their stuff figured out, but maybe just asking questions and making sure they're not operating in dinosaur ways, they've got optimized. And having a, you know, not a, I'm demanding things, but let's have a talk and see if you can do some better things, choose a better hosting provider, whatever, I don't know. But yeah, I mean, server issues are real, especially when you're not using a streamlined one that has a huge team that has lots of different servers that you can go to.
00:35:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Well, I mean, I spoke to him yesterday, spoke to Jim yesterday and, you know, I mean, I could tell he's in it like he sounded just like just done with the whole thing and ready to to move and get it fixed. he he promised me an update by Thursday, by tomorrow, and I'll I'll text him if I don't want hear from him. You know, I I just have been, I've kind of given a longer leash to them, I guess.
00:36:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
pacing comes in because there's just something you can't predict. and there was a big learning curve and then it's that's where priority comes into because if this isn't your bread and butter yeah but you got this existing asset and your priority was don't lose the asset but don't be buried by it don't have to do the marketing basically you tap into my existing resources and I get paid there's no reason not to let it take a pace that is chill as long as you can tell it's being moved along stuff is getting done maybe it's not the way you would have wanted to but 80-20 is you're barely touching it it should still end up paying you you just have to get set up but the advising you know I don't know how old they are but if you're dealing with a man and his grown son it's been around for a while probably little bit up there um yeah yeah and also I think yeah John's in his 60s and Jim is like early
00:38:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
really for you. So he's, he's around my age and, you know, they, uh, Jim is like his, um, his operations person basically. So he works with his dad on his office. Hey, who's dad?
00:38:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who's son?
00:38:21 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, John, John is the dad.
00:38:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jim is the son.
00:38:24 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, it's definitely moving, uh, slower than I expected, but I also, I do, I do feel like it's going to get solved here real soon. Like I talked to him yesterday about, you know, I'd really like to get this off for a live next month. Uh, do you have to knew anything? Is, well, I, I purchased, um, bunch of tea for inventory. So, you know, that's a cost I've already made and invested in, and I brought that up like 10 days ago to them when reached out, like, let's get a timeline, like, I've done so much I've invested, and that really got their attention and a lot of apologies and that kind of thing.
00:39:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are costs split, do they have to pay for half of that also?
00:39:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
They don't have any cash, so I took that on and I get, like, all the profit goes to pay me back off the top from the first sales.
00:39:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A couple more things real quick. Can you, so something to maybe think about is use this as an exclusive offer. Hey, we had some tech issues and we just bought inventory, so we got to move this stuff to make sure whatever. Use that because that's real. Tap into that, maybe offer a special discount, but maybe it's not really like it's the price is built into it. So it's framed that way. Maybe ask them to email offer a little bit more aggressively than they would.
00:40:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
That's a potential thing.
00:40:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or if that tea goes bad and it doesn't get used, it comes out of their cuts when the money does come. Just some things to think about.
00:40:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah. Yeah, mean, we we all went into like in when I agreed to. To make that investment in John was up front from the very beginning from the very first call of like. He doesn't have any money to put into this, and he's had some financial struggles. Well, that's another reason to double check on the server issue, because maybe he's cutting corners, he shouldn't be cutting and being foresighted about it. That's true.
00:41:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because especially with an older school guy, that's possible. So, you know, and that's kind of affect you, something to think about.
00:41:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure.
00:41:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think it figured out there's a huge dynamic difference, though, between that and how you started with other people, especially an older gentleman, that, you know, the dynamic should be your ultimately the boss. And it started with, you know, I want this 33, no.
00:41:54 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I've got 50, they each have 25.
00:41:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's probably not really anything else to talk about that particular thing, right?
00:42:11 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I don't think so. It's just moving slowly and about connected with Jim tomorrow to get an update.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll let you go. So with this guy working with the lead company in political conservative space, that, did we talk about that? Was that part of the, you were talking about a consulting job and making an offer? And was that what you were referencing?
00:42:45 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, this is, the company is American Target advertising. Been around for decades. Found a by guy named Richard Bigory who back in the. late 60s like he's an older dude and he is like he invented like a new category of political fundraising and that's back in the late 60s raising money for Nixon and people like that and and it's it's really kind of burst a lot of the way that political fundraising is is done today I know him through through Brian because he was in Brian's the mastermind and his right hand is a lady named Kathleen Patton who I know really well but they they recently hired a like a director of digital marketing or something like that and she her name's Marcy she's in she went through the over-delivered boot camp And that we just finished yesterday. And I just heard her mention on a call that they were gonna be hiring, looking to hire an email, a copywriter. So I just sent her an email. was like, hey, I heard you say this, are you looking for full time, time? She said, part time. So I just said, I just basically told her I'd love to put my hat in the ring, told her I knew all the people she knows. And also just shared like, I do personally feel compelled to, like I do want the Republicans to win in November. And I want to, I would love to make a contribution to that. And that's all genuine and legit. shared that with her. Cause that's stuff I usually don't share with anybody. Yeah. so in Kathleen and I have talked politics a whole lot, and so I center a whole bunch of writing samples of stuff that I've done, and they're going to reach out to schedule a call heard from her yesterday that they were going to be reviewing everything and getting it to me.
00:45:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things I want to point out. Think about, ask about whatever. Yeah. Number one, it's while, but we talked about the power of network and how feeding that and nurturing that brings things around when, whether it be political and having those types of allies, there's going to be a day where we're all going to have their band arms one way or another. First, we physically, whatever it's going to happen, who we know, and the the level of relationships we have when that happens for people, whether it's large scale or small community scale, something is inevitable. Some type of civil upheaval is gonna happen. So that's one thing. To just getting to have a contribution in the way things do, we have no right to complain about anything when we won't do what's in front of us, you know. So there's that, you having the agora experience, just having an awareness of how agora emails, how they market, things like that, and how that impacts politics, because there's definitely a lot of involving there, is useful and beneficial. one thing I would do is change the way you ask the question about it and frame it. And now I'll take you back to blue collar worker full time of hard time, irrelevant surgeon. What are the results that you want? What are the results that you're looking for? Now we're talking about value, but when you say full-time part-time, you're automatically putting yourself in an hourly type position, evaluating your value per hour. You don't want that ever. You want to be evaluated based on your results. So we have an existing email list, we bring about $x in sales, we're looking to make this list. This is how often we email. This is our attrition rate on the email list. Like get data, don't ask about full-time part-time, just ask about what is your current email situation.
00:47:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Can I ask you some questions first?
00:47:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'd love to have a conversation with you about this. Email is something that I have a proven truck record of and making a significant lift in sales. Bye. multiples, you know, speaking in language like that, which, you know, people, people can use and use and they do, but that's true for you. And as you dig into it and ask the numbers, you can get that. But start positioning yourself immediately. Start leveraging the words and the conversation that you use immediately. You are not the hourly worker, you are not the employee, you are not the grunt worker, you are always consultants and experts, even if you're doing the labor.
00:48:37 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I take that point. I think my, my counter to that would be that this is not like a, I mean, small company in the sense of like, it doesn't have thousands of employees, but I know it's been around for a long time. It's kind of a corporate mentality. quality. And I will showcase all the things that you're talking about on a call with them. And at the same time, I know that if I feel like if I led with that with them, that it would be skipping, I'm trying to get my foot in the door. So I know they're thinking in terms of full-time or part-time. They say we want a full-time person. would have, I would know that like, well that I can't commit to that because what they're thinking is I want somebody 40 hours a week. so knowing that they're just looking for a part-time freelancer, that's helpful because I know that and what I said is like I'd love to have a conversation with you about what you're looking for and see if I can help. So I'm just trying to get the conversation in that conversation. Once I get it, then, you know, I can shift their understanding of what this is and what the potential is by the questions I asked. I take your point like I see what you're saying.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I see what you're saying with the foot and the door. I still think that you may be reframing it in terms of what kind of volume are you looking for? Because that answers your full-time part-time and maybe they don't know it, which in and of itself is a signal because even if it's a good cause, you only have so much energy and time bandwidth. So if it's a poorly managed business or if the arrangement is not leveraged, even if it's a good cause, you might be signing up for or more than you really want to give and can give at this time so that's just something to think about not so and this goes back to you and it's been a while i don't know actually if you and i have ever talked about it but good better best i'm familiar with the concepts so the thing is you have finite yeses if you say yes to good things that's good if you say yes to great things that's great but here's the deal if you fill up with good and great you don't or good better best good and better you don't have room for best so you know do you want the best and and here's the other thing is sometimes we get these things that put something on our radar that never was on our radar before and sometimes that's all we needed so maybe it's all right this isn't really what I've got the bandwidth for right now but now I know I want to put my skills towards helping the Republicans win or or you know what I'm just going to volunteer this or I will do this which isn't everything you want but here's what I'll do here's the price that I'll charge you and here's why I think it's a no-brainer and you could take it or leave it but still put it inside of your terms don't worry about foot in the door because either they're going to vibe with your energy and the mission and the fact that you're not taking advantage of them but that you're also compartmentalizing and going okay but this is this is what I can this is the limit to what I can bring today um but then just and the other the other part of the pitch is but once I get inside and see what you're doing what I'll offer for free is a consultation for optimization and and just what I
00:53:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
see about improvement.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you can find where in the conversation to have that or not have that. But remember that even in these things, when you want to get in your foot in the door, remember your level of expertise, that's all. And that there's finite time and energy.
00:53:22 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I see that.
00:53:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But then go chase the right thing that serves that purpose if you want it because it is an election year. And you do have major skills. So anyway, okay. You still have time.
00:53:41 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Okay.
00:53:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would really love to know about the boot camp, how that went.
00:53:47 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, this is over the boot camp. This the only second time we've done it. I don't love it. Yeah. And it went only at 30. people sign up. so I was emailing with Brian yesterday because he was like, on the next boot camp, I want to add more of his ads to the slides and things like that because they're just basic slides. our response to him was like, yeah, we can do that. But I think the bigger challenge is like figuring out how to sell this. So because we had 60 people sign up on the first one. And, you know, like, if I, if I'm not the target market for the real, real boot camp, like if I had bought that and gone through it, I wouldn't be happy because it's, I mean, it's really kind of about principles. like Brian, Brian's thing is not teaching the, the nitty-gritty pretty stuff. Like he's big picture and he talks in terms of like, you know, like the closest to like a tactical thing he talks about is like when you're developing your first order, always have the second order in mind. And that's a helpful like concept that he can riff on. But that's like an example of like the most tactical that he gets. His wheelhouse is just not in really getting into things that you walk away and you're like, oh man, that's amazing. But at the same time, the reason I say I'm not the target market is because there are people in the boot camp who will say, wow, that was amazing. And they loved it.
00:55:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so, I mean, that's like listening to Socrates or Marcus Aurelius you know there's philosophy and some people's brains don't think like that and they haven't had those teachers so that value is huge because the tactics mean nothing if you don't understand the philosophy behind it and I'm with you I want tactics I'm full of philosophy you know but so segmentation first of all of the list and just kind of being able to figure out who is philosophical and who's tactile tactical and being able to serve them more because whoever's you know soaking up the philosophy more that serves a purpose and you can correlate a monetary benefit to that because it changes how you operate because it You know, like you said, principles, um, so, but, but if there's a person who's looking for tactics, that's going to be so annoying and frustrating because there's nothing super actionable or clearly defined. so, um, something to think about is, is there a way and it could be really short and you could use AI for this. So, have AI just go through all the transcripts and say pull out all the principles. Okay. um, do you have suggestions for tactics, for executing these principles inside of a business? Give an example for this type of business, this type of business, this size of business, this financial, you know, monetary thing type of business, and use it to put maybe a little bit more on it. So, um, And then maybe you can just sell that with what was there plus the outline and maybe some supplemental videos that you do as a not a live thing, but a prerecorded course. See what kind of feedback you get on it, maybe drive traffic just to that and not make it super expensive. But now you've captured all of your existing stuff, your repurposing and not doing good. This is what wasn't. Get some reviews on it. then if you only do a live one once or twice a year, then it gets more energy. You kind of bottleneck it so people have to build up and like look forward to it. And it's kind of a launch style instead, which I think would energize Brian. And you know, that's the whole kind of thing, which also reduces how many times you even have to think about doing it. It just starts like that.
00:59:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, the AI thing is a good idea to be able to see what opportunity might be there to make it a little more tactical because that also helps with selling it and being able to talk about what they're going to get. I was about this today during my workout, it's like for Titans, I'm both the visionary and the integrator and I see, like with Tim, like if I were to propose an idea to Tim, it's like hey, I'm going to do this bootcamp and it's going to, because Tim's got a book coming out, right? So, hey, we're going to do this bootcamp around your book. like, Tim would, would put the thing, an outline of the whole thing together. And, and we would get on a call and we would go through that and we would refine it. And Brian is not going to do that. So if anything is going to happen, it's going to be needed to create it. And so in my mind, I think like, well, break through advertising is one thing, because it's, it's an investment, like it's a brand that's going to outlive Brian. And I've created, so I'm motivated to like, to create around that brand.
01:00:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's tactical by design.
01:00:36 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
And it's tactical. Yeah. to liver. You know, that's, that's going to be a, that's not our brand beyond Brian and, and he's, it's, I just always felt like I'm pulling Brian. to, you know, whatever you want to call success after his career in boardroom. And he would tell you that too. So, there's a little bit of a, I feel like I want to protect my time with the over-delivered boot camp of like, in and knock this thing out of the park.
01:01:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you get any conversions yet?
01:01:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, yeah. We've added four people into TXL from the 38. The deadline is Sunday. I think we'll probably end up with 15. So, like, that right there is, that's my motivation is like, okay, if this is a good way to get people into TXL.
01:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, let's put a number on that. Yeah. you. Let's say you got. 15 people in.
01:02:01 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What does that work to you? Uh, 15 people, you know, tell you. Uh, people.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Calculate it right in front of you if you want it.
01:02:14 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
What's that?
01:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
there's a calculator right in front of you if you want it on that computer.
01:02:19 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I'm doing it right now.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got my calculator up. My brain would go, uh, I can't do math on the band when somebody's looking at me.
01:02:32 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So that, if we get 15, that's, uh, 5,400 to me.
01:02:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now roughly how much time do you think it spends on it?
01:02:44 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Uh, the, the, uh, there were six calls, hour and a half.
01:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Include promotions and anything else.
01:02:56 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Well, this time I just, I just ran the same email. We did on the first one.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:03:02 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
I didn't rewrite those. I mean, I want to have calls six of them, so six times. So nine, nine hours for the calls and probably another five hours.
01:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Want to know that hourly rate roughly? Three hundred and eighty five dollars an hour.
01:03:31 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, for everything else that I know that you do, I don't think that you average a lot higher than that. Even with your consulting.
01:03:42 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Right.
01:03:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now the other thing is how much you enjoy the time and how tedious it is and that type of thing. Now that's a big factor. And if you can do things that you enjoy more for roughly the equivalent, you know. amount of time so but that's another reason too and and because you know Ryan has help issues that come up that sometimes things have to get rescheduled he's definitely got a lot of things that that can that come up every year there's something he just had another surgery on his heart oh last month lesson so anyway so taking that and figuring out what you can do to optimize it and then making it an evergreen just pre-recording thing and then if you want to having maybe it's once a year over delivered bootcamp and you pre-sell you know and it's like embedded into everything else like at the bottom of the email p s p s that type of thing offering everything hey we're doing this later and then closer to it do a ramp up advertising thing and now that changes everything the energy should be really hot You can have the tactics, can have all the pretty graphics that make Brian excited about it and really make it a big production, which helps with the brand, which I think matters to Brian. And it's over delivering like it's built to over deliver. He can have other gifts like because you guys can kind of, if you're pre selling it and people are buying it. And you can tell him like if you can't make it live, here's the recordings and you get all of these bonuses. Plus here's the best action bonuses if you sign up between this month and this month because we're going to build up for a whole year, that kind of thing. You can really make it a production that helps him feel like he's keeping his brand live and he's feeding his brand. This isn't Jean's stuff, this is his. And so it's kind of an homage. It mitigizes how much work you put into it. You get to build the engine which you love to do, right? engine is the thing. The demo comes duplicatable. for be a bootcamp if you wanted to do it so you can have be a live versus not but since we know that that really is where most of accelerator members come from and they got to play with that a little bit but anyway you are primed to optimize all of this for multiple reasons brian's health yeah um you're you're just simply doing this everywhere and you've got other options so you don't have to be you know he he doesn't have you over a barrel so to speak you know um there's there's so much that's evolved and on top of that AI can really help take existing content that you've gotten over and over again and go what are the best parts of this and really give you some some tools so that even if you're doing it yourself you're not really you know what i mean i get chatgbt4o changed everything
01:07:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
You know, actually, I think what I would do, because I'm pretty sure, can't you, you can upload videos into chat GPT. I haven't done it yet.
01:07:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've taken video transcripts, but I wouldn't be surprised if you can now.
01:07:15 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can't, if not, can get a transcript of it, but I think I would take the recordings from this bootcamp and say, listen to this lesson. And, and they help me come up with, you know, specific tactics that, that would go along with it. That I think would be, because when I think about over-delivered, because I've read the book and it's like, like, it, it just, it's, it requires, for me, just a lot of mental energy, like, to make the connection from the philosophical to, like, how do we make this real?
01:07:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you know what else you could do? Is you could build a couple of avatars Say so chat tpt first of all here's all kinds of my Kent called content. Here's my call recordings Here are things that I've written okay learn me First of all profile me. What do you know about me? Okay? me tell you some other things about how I feel about business what annoys me what I like when I'm looking for help This is what I'm looking for here We're gonna build an avatar around me and people like me so that if I'm serving people like me I know how to talk to them and then we're gonna profile Brian's type of person that likes a philosophy. So profile both of them okay, so then you give them the Him it the the over-delivered PDF okay Tell it what you love about it What was good? But tell them what's tedious for you why it's tedious how it's tedious if you could fix it how you would fix it and give an Example like this is written blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all I wanted to say is
01:09:00 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
this.
01:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want a tactical executable thing. For example, this. Okay, now I want you to go through the whole rest of the book. And I want you to pull out five specific tactics that you think are the most leverageable for any business owner. Okay, first, tell me what they are. Let me approve them. Okay, I approve these. Now, I want you to give me the simplest while also being understandable, comprehensible suggestion for tactical implementation in a business. And I want you to give me three examples and turn them into anecdotes starting with one of those tactics. You could probably improve it, but most of that will be actionable all by itself. You can make the over-deliver, you know, basically what, um, BAM is, you know, for BA, something like that, but it it's for you, but guaranteed other people want that. So the pitch to Brian is like, look, not everybody thinks the same way, but the value is still there. Their brains just operate differently. Let's give them this. And so yeah, take all the videos, take the PDF, and then direct it on a mental process, you know, type of vibe avatar.
01:10:34 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah.
01:10:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think about even exciting too, and take the tediousness out of it, because it's happening so fast, and you get to watch happen and you get to watch it go, I didn't do that. I just directed it, and you whip it all out there. So that could put some energy back into you around something that I felt like it's been draining.
01:10:58 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
Yeah, I mean, the nice thing about the bootcamp is like, I don't have to teach it, and you know, it's like it's a low-ask of me in terms of delivery. I also think that part of, and I share this with Brian's, do think a contributing factor to the number of signups is that we held it in July, because the last time we held it in April. And so I suggested to him, it's like, I think that we should just plan out a bootcamp cadence for the year. So Q1, we do a BA bootcamp, Q2, we do an over-delivered bootcamp, then Q4, we do another BA bootcamp. And we just have those on the calendar.
01:11:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or end of Q3, like, so end of September, where people have been in school, all the college kids are in school, everybody's in school now, and they've had a little time to, you know, because you've got an end. In the country, a huge amount of people start school in August and then September and then the colleges. by the end of September, 1st week of October, you're not in holiday mode and everybody has settled down and starting to fall into their fall routine and I don't think people take enough advantage of that particular time of the year of availability mentally and energetically financially, we recovered the, you know, working during the summer, spending all the expenses there, kind of thing.
01:12:33 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
So anyway, something to take into account. That's true. All right.
01:12:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
got to take my dogs, take your dogs, Hank and, Hank and Hattie, we've got this like calming medicine.
01:12:50 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We started giving to Hattie for the groupers.
01:12:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that work? What is it?
01:12:55 - Chris Mason (chrismason.net)
We have it. It's a. a lot lazza roll or something like that it's It just mellows around we would do it around if there's gonna be fireworks Cuz she gets real nervous with that, but Yeah, we gave her a pill If you find out what the details are and let me know cuz I have a dog that cries every time he gets in the car drives me Bonkers bonkers.
01:13:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, I will let you go. It's so good to catch up with you You just maybe not be such a stranger for a month maybe yeah, no promises You know I wrote on that sheet a couple times couple I saw once I Know once this month and it was last week All right, take care of yourself and I'll talk to you soon. Love you. Bye. too.

## Quote 11

> 00:00:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, hey lady. How are you? Good. How is that onesie?
00:00:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Comfy, but I just started my period and I'm cramping and it hurts. And that is definitely what messed up my sleep. But did you know I did not know it messed up my sleep so bad until I started cracking my cycle?
00:00:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, interesting.
00:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the nights that you have a sleep. Oh my gosh, like the worst. And I never really made that correlation. Like I know what my cycle is. I almost always have a 28 day cycle, although in perimenopause, I've gone like four months, a few times without it. But because I take my hormones regularly, it kind of regulated it again.
00:00:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah.
00:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But the two days right before, I'm like, cannot sleep at all.
00:00:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then yesterday,
00:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like my I had the raging migraine all day long and my sugar was low no matter what I ate I even ate pizza and cookie dough oh and so that was really enjoyable but then like I woke up in the middle of the night and I could feel it dropping so then I went to eat more of it but I should not have done that because I felt like garbage anyway and then my sugar totally spiked on me I'm like you know make up your mind oh my god that's funny so then I went to sleep and my daughter went to seminary because we were so we were up early but like she can manage either seminary or school and can't seem to get both done because honestly it's a lot hmm yeah and she's trying to figure out herself and I'm in the place where I was just like oh and my other daughter she's in beauty school and she was not prepared for the fact that they were chemical peels on the faces yesterday, and microdermabrasion on the back. So her body went through it. And I'm just like, okay. And then I got asked out by this crusty old nasty man today, he texted. But like he tried ask me out a few years ago, I'm pretty sure he's old enough to be my dad.
00:02:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I'm talking just crusty.
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
people's faces are cool. Okay, that was actually called gag reflex just now. I was not being sorry, dramatic. I just ate. And the thought of it is making me really, truly nervous. yeah, so he thought he would invite me to a church singles dinner. And I'm just like, I normally want to watch my mouth. But today I want to tell everybody to off.
00:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got you. I am very excited and happy to talk to you again.
00:02:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, that's funny. God. what an experience for your holy cow. It's Interesting though that you're tracking your sleep cycles and you found it on the day of your period because it's like this morning I started watching YouTube video from a new person. I'm gonna start following She was on a hay house meditation because I couldn't sleep last night. So I started listening to it and she wrote the Book she's a doctor and but she writes about menopause as well and intermittent fasting and she's got a book She just released called Fast like a girl or something like and and then another one's about menopause for woman but anyway, the thing that she said was interesting is She she has a good YouTube video is about Phases you're in whether it's perimenopause whether it's menopause or post-menopause and the kind of Fasting or diet structure. That's good to follow. I found interesting. Anyways, I'm a little If you ever heard of her, I'll send you the link if you're interested. Yeah, my probably followers are already. I've learned so much. Okay, let me see. I'll send it to my friend, I'm not Amanda. I'm Amanda Chavon. My friend Chavon. My man in a group text. me just get this. There you go. Hold on. It's Dr. Mindy Hells. Yes. Oh, you know where? Okay. Okay, got it. And then it's so funny because when I was googling her, I'm like, I can't believe people make a business model on this because how many people Google her because she's big now. On Etsy, there are a ton of for like $2.99 or maybe $5.10, $18.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All of these planners for fasting using Indeed Peltz's protocol. Yeah, I mean, this is the thing because somebody was posting. Like, are we really in a recession? Like, is there really money problems? And I said. But here's the issue, there's plenty of money out there to be had by people who are creative and willing to be of service and to fill a need. But the other thing is that people who are doing that are also taking care of the people who don't know how to do that, who don't emotionally have it in them, who don't have resources or the capability for some reason, totally sorry I'm just like tangent, but like the gas prices, the groceries, the rent, all these other things, those things truly have increased 33 to 50% or more. Some of it has been like 400% looking at the grocery prices, it's closer to 400%. So people that are any kind of connected to their community are definitely filling the pain at the end. economy. But, you know, the perspective is, is that this, there is, did you ever see the movie robots with Will, Will Smith? No, yeah, I was Will Smith and that Robin Williams was in it.
00:06:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I'm sure I've seen it. Let me see, there's maybe Will Smith was the eye robot. Yeah, Okay, the cartoon one.
00:06:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, did you ever see it?
00:06:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
00:06:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Maybe not. Um, Robin Williams, it's a great cast. Jennifer Coolidge, Mel Brooks, William McGregor. It's amazing. Um, but, um, it was about this, uh, you know, awkward robot who didn't fit in, but he made his way in the world and he was a fan of this inventor who ended up being, you know, a jerk. But his thing was always see a need, feel a need. And that's how you make a arc and that's how you change the world and anyway so yes we really and truly are in a recession and but the reason people can't figure it out is because there is tons of money still being spent in a market but the the money has shifted but yeah oh you don't need all of it you just need enough and these people are like there's another quote that i love is um don't get in the way away if you think something's impossible get out of the way of people who are doing it or something like that love that yeah anyway so and all of this is in perfect alignment with what you're doing because i'll say we are doing yeah um because youtube is a way for everybody to get a piece of it and the whole you know what i came across and shared with you last week is that less than two percent or around two percent of youtube on YouTubers are actual content creators, that's wild.
00:08:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, anyway, well, no, and it was cool on the the teaching, like everyone loved it, and I'm doing a repeat of it on tomorrow as well. Oh, I should actually send an email out to remind people. Um, but, you know, it's just, it's so interesting that, um, people are looking for alternative things right now too, at the same time. Like, I don't know, maybe you do, but I hear from my other friends that people who used to sell a ton of switching tangent a little bit, who used to sell a lot of money on high ticket coaching, now trying to figure out what to do, right, because the sales aren't coming in. so now obviously they're looking at AC phones too, but, um, I think the YouTube thing, uh, is a no risk solution because it's free. Did I tell you? So my sister didn't even know that it was free to post a video on YouTube and start a channel.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:09:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, Oh, my God, Julia, I need to get you on a Zoom call and record you. And I post the video up because you're asking questions I never even thought people would have. I just assumed people, you know, so yeah, she's like, Oh, wow, that actually really is cool to launch a business that way, right? one of the guys on the YouTube course on Saturday, yeah, I also said that, um, yeah, we were always taught to monetize it by getting the subscribers and the views and then ads, but I love segueing to digital offers. So so and that's before I didn't tell anyone about the name change that we're going to do. I kept it to keep congruent with what they bought. I kept it as YouTube fast track naming convention, you know, I think I changed the slide deck to just say YouTube profits so that we didn't have to do too much re tooling later. Oh, yeah. Mm hmm.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have my heating pad on too, just so you know Buffalo Plaid onesie so you can visualize this. I got up and took my daughter to oh my gosh I keep forgetting I got to meet with my attorney clients at one o'clock too. They're awesome I'm just like want to be in bed today not really but like physically. I was like that yesterday I actually from one o'clock on I just stopped working I but mine was different I had that hot chocolate hangover oh yeah yeah I finally feel amazed today but I'm getting back into intermittent fasting and I do feel better today like it's two o'clock I have energy so that's a good good thing yeah let's see Within two weeks, you just highlight all this. Here's the entire recording, um, but this is not downloadable, right?
00:11:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it is actually.
00:11:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me go there so I can download it. don't want to. Do you happen to have to zoom have a transcript for you? Because that would be what's most helpful to me.
00:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, what I can do is upload it to unlisted YouTube channel and it produces the transcript.
00:11:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. Would you please because I want to, um, go through and make the first version of an outline that you can go through. Oh, yeah, I covered all this. I bet you'll probably even surprise yourself by how maybe not because I know you studied any prepared everything. But with the questions that people asked you. Yeah. then everything that you covered. And then what we could do is look at did and um oh I don't know how good my brain is going to do right now sorry I was thinking about using Maui to create some you know graphically pleasing things that you're not spending time doing that and I could pay for that and and work with him and follow some instructions I was thinking um that you know lots of people make the make youtube products use youtube colors or they use their branding colors and I think a blend of because we know that blue is trust a deep dark a deep dark blue that goes good with the youtube red and um nice oh I like that I do let me see if I can find a hex color yeah the reason I chose the reds and the sales page because I remember watching another guy I don't know know is no heard of his name's Korosh I forget his last name he's kind of like a uh a secret allen sultanic like he's behind the scenes of a lot
00:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
low ticket funnels as well. And I'm in his community because I paid $27 for his low ticket offer. He was reviewing someone's offer about YouTube. And I remember he gave the guy , he said, okay, you got to, the copy's not bad, but you know, you have to have red in here because this is YouTube course you're selling and people are familiar with YouTube and use the red. So that's where I got that little tip because normally I don't use red in my sales pages.
00:13:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So dark blue gradient. I see that's a little darker than I want.
00:13:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we're going to be like Superman colors than I was thinking. Oh yeah, I love that. Me too. I actually have a Superman t-shirt.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love it. So Marvel or DC? I'm a Superman's DC, but are you more Marvel or DC?
00:13:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know the difference.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just like the movies. What? Yeah, I assume all of those are Marvel, but Superman is easy Batman and DC Now, you know nerdy I am That's cool.
00:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I watched really cool I think what I mean about a TED talk how Marvel licensed a lot of these brands and it was yeah, it was a cool business kind of TED talk.
00:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Oh, yeah for sure so I think something not quite as dark as this, but I was hoping that if I picked one it would give me more Ooh like this something like that Um, so with the youtube red like that will just compliment really well.
00:14:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's see You know, you literally could just grab the hexacode from the Superman logo I don't know you wanted to go that brighter blue.
00:14:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I don't I well So I think about I strain when I okay And certain colors are easier on the eyes.
00:15:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, okay. Okay.
00:15:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, anyway, but I think something, something like that, and it almost feels kind of Superman esque. And you could put, let's if there's like a YouTube logo here, design elements.
00:15:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And obviously, obviously a yellow will go with a nice fat too.
00:15:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Let's see. Elements back. I mean, they just look good together, that looks powerful to me.
00:15:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
looks really good, actually. I like that's pretty cool. That's got a nice and well, there's darker versions.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I wonder what the darker version What's funny is check out, I'm going to put it in the zoom chat. I just googled like color combinations for red and blue. And this particular pin on Pinterest is kind of identical to the colors you got on there just for just for yachts. Go ahead and click that link in the zoom chat.
00:16:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious, Maria. Yes. Are we not in sync? I love that. I love that. Oh, I like this. The colors are not quite the same, so we can edit to match.
00:16:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I'm just going to grab my tea.
00:16:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
My tea.
00:16:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My green tea. tea. Mm, text. OK. Alrighty. I don't know. I am not a designer, but just just a little like idea. Something to start with. He's really great at stuff, but I like hobby. beginning of like let's use these kinds of colors um yeah i don't know but i mean i think it looks sharp i mean i will look that and go you or anything like that yeah no no i i love it i think it looks fantastic yeah yeah um just for the heck of do you want me to find that youtube sales page or that other guy for sure okay let me see let's we can use this as um just kind of gathering resources and then making a gangpline because you still have one call on deck for gaining information and then um but i would love to mass assimilate everything and if we're um you know we we weren't kind of opposite schedules but we don't need to be in meetings to be productive our rocks or chats are really productive i do screen captures i'm sure you do screen captures so like if we want to be aggressive about setting a deadline and putting something together like you can see i'm i'm willing to like we can create things together i can put things into membership areas like we can really roll this out quickly.
00:19:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I figured it'd be like go high level membership area because I know sistine.io has membership area but for like scaling it.
00:19:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and um worst key scenario like one of them worst case scenario but like damn um he would be helpful especially if you threw him a bum by not charging him so much or something. Yeah sure yeah but like he's got his team is like really good at it and fast and they know lots of things they could help us with the chat bot um so there's a lot that we could do and however that works out like uh I could help you with whatever you're doing with him like I don't want to uneven the burden but in terms of like getting something done quickly, efficiently, expertly. Yeah we've got some some resources to go to. My girl has um been kind of quiet. she's a young mom with young kids and trying to figure out babysitting stuff lately.
00:20:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:20:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, anyway, so I think that that could be a good place to start and build a home kind of quickly. I say easily because we've got people and if people need to be paid, I'm willing to put money out to pay for it. However, you know what I mean? Like I am in whatever this takes because I know that you're going to bring amazing content.
00:20:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's hurting. Well, yeah, and what it'll be cool is like, here's what the Nirvana that I'm looking forward to. was going to say it because I know this is what you also will be good at. I'm sure and want to be in control of is like just all of the keeping to the plan, like the big rocks and
00:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and future plan and having like financial meetings like you'll go okay like whether you hire a VA or someone to actually monitor you know the the money's coming in and money's going out for this and then um just I just think that would be really cool to have like CFO dashboard type meetings once a week or something or maybe it's in our like yeah so so yeah uh shoots so we can start I always start rudimentary we'll call it um you know we'll just do that and so we can track um so expense description I'm um source paid Um, so like if it's Tina's account or Maria's account, whatever, yeah, then revenue. Um, we'll, we'll track, um, resource, date, received, um, um, paid to Maria, yeah, I'm out, paid to Tina, out, we'll just, this is rudimentary too.
00:22:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I don't know, I get it, yeah.
00:22:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow, and then oh, actually we'll go paid to Maria. Cause I have no idea how we're going to do it and organize, but I think that you were talking about like doing it US for reasons and so, yeah, you know, like because so many things are changing like now, even when I use, um, Upwork, they want to,
00:23:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
and Fiverr. They want to charge me GST. So if I hire someone for like 10 bucks to do an e-book cover, then all of sudden they're charging 13% on it. So when I pay the person their 10 bucks, I'm also paying the extra $1.30. And that'll add up over time, which is ridiculous because me, I don't know how they're doing it because it's against tax law because the only time you pay GST is if the service provider lives in Canada as well. So if someone lives in Pakistan, I'm still paying this goods and services tax and harmonized tax. It's like, whoa, so yeah, we would lose out so much if we had to do through my Canadian company, all the members, like all the revenues in, all the expenses. I'd rather have your US entity have all the revenues in expenses and all that jazz.
00:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, we will, we will, we can plan on that and then figure out how to, you know, because we're not great, but that definitely sounds like we're probably better than, than doing it that way. So, um, Yeah, okay, so we will, so let me share this with you.-hmm. Sure. Yeah. Um, what, it's self-explanatory. Sure, anyway. You know, nobody can't, okay. Um, oh, what was the YouTube sales page?
00:24:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, uh, yeah, I just set that to you in the Zoom chat.
00:24:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, there it is.
00:24:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was a nice time. It was a nice say it. Oh.
00:24:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Now his givers are high because he's a YouTube agency as well. That created a little ticket. So all of those testimonials are his one-on-one agency client. So I thought that was a little not cool, but it is what it is, I guess.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah. So what is it about this that you do like and that you want to model?
00:24:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what, oh, no, no, no, nothing to model off. It was just, it was just, that was the funnel. The guy was critiquing because he had an old. for colors. And then and Kurosh was like, okay, you're selling YouTube and you got to make these colors red and white and black.
00:25:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, got you.
00:25:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's all. That was just the point. Like, I have no idea how well it converts. I'm sure it's good. But obviously he's got a good back end because he does like high ticket AMC YouTube work for people. So yeah.
00:25:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I mean, it's not much of a product. He's just giving out 100 done for your video. He's actually bought it. It's just a freaking like, of course, he has some videos about it, which is good. But it literally is just like beginnings, like the hooks for a video. It's ridiculous.
00:25:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wonder what kind of YouTube PLR we could get to value stack.
00:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I already bought one on Etsy. And if you pull in that Canva template that I gave to resell rights, the YouTube ultimate, the ultimate YouTube planner. And it was Pretty decent, actually.
00:26:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, what kind of did you give me?
00:26:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, I think I also sent you like in that email that I gave you a copy of. There's a link to the slide deck. Actually, I'm sorry.
00:26:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I didn't like give you the Canva template on Friday and it's in the Trello board Friday night.
00:26:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, if you just click the Google Drive link, I can show you where the links are to the presentation as well, whichever is easiest.
00:26:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, well, let me get two profits for you and change this.
00:26:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I don't know if I put it in that board, so I think I might put it in the list of YouTube profits under HQ, Business HQ, I think.
00:26:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, because that's where we decided we were going to do things. Yeah, so, um, there you go, draft presentations. Yeah. Yeah, I have bad the windows that you probably can't see that are in the way I got to move. Oh, OK. Out of the way in the chat, uh, sorry. Where am I going?
00:26:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Under YouTube profits for offer. Let's do the second one draft presentation. Oh, okay. I moved it up higher.
00:27:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could see it higher Dang it open. I just want to open you.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. There you go. Okay, cool Oh, look at this Yes Well, maybe I can See that way and if you go to page 12 Oh, I quoted you on the on the video on page 10 Uh, and then when I'm talking I say and this was from my friend Tina Marie that said this so good Do you want to live on youtube or do you want to live? I mean there now everything else I've made the don't be temple bundle research and google worship But the ultimate youtube planner camera template that's from master resale rights. It's actually pretty darn good I just changed the the the beginning of it um Yeah I just changed the cover page see how it's got pictured me there Gleeing against the graffiti wall.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes Oh, I see.
00:28:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. I mean, it's pretty decent.
00:28:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And we could just change the branding like the style and the layout or did you already do that?
00:28:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, all I did is change the cover to put a picture of me in the background. I didn't really didn't teach by it. I said, look, if you're the type of person that needs a planner, here's this because the Google Google sheet is really the planner and the implementation thing, you know?
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Just the tiniest bit of like making everything white instead of cream and like maybe changing the font and apply all so that it looks slightly different. I agree. it doesn't look at an immediate man thing.
00:28:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I literally downloaded it Friday at 11 p.m.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with before this. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not saying you should have done it already. I was just saying we do this and I'd be happy to do it and all that. And you did so much.
00:28:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, I was up to a minute on Friday preparing it.
00:28:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are, you our rock star workhorse. It's so good.
00:29:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The real man is for you to be making the money and like it not be for your clients or a husband or whatever. feel good that way and then Tina and honestly made me think because there's two other people that remember there was a few people pipeline. There's two other people still pretty serious about wanting to hire me and it makes me think like just to stick with this and this only you know and not even entertain. I'm just telling them hey look I'm fully booked till January February something. don't know but just because listen this pulled in I envisioned 30 sales I said 30 spots do you know that because remember when I talked there was 20 spots like 2k I think at five minutes to 12 before it closed and redirected to hey it's closed URL the 30th sale came in and I was and I was visioning 30 spots.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ah, girl, that manifestor in you.
00:30:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. Yeah. So I thought that was cool. Now I reopened it just today to close to work since I'm teaching again live tomorrow. So I'm just going to send a quick email to my list in case any stragglers because I've had a few messages. Hey, can I still get in? But yeah, anyways, just some thoughts about that.
00:30:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You've got the one guy at $5,000 every month and you said that covers your lights on costs, right?
00:30:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It really does. Like I do pay Sally some money out of it. Like I paid her 500 a few days ago to work on like the crap stuff that I like to do, like the formatting inside the funnel and his go-high level account and like putting together some.
00:30:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, go ahead. All right. Before I lose my train of thought because my pain, I lose my focus or easy. Yeah. One second. almost did it. Oh, so in terms of like now, this wouldn't be as much money. But first of all, right now, like your needs. are close to met, especially with the extra little bit of income, but would it not be more joyful for you even if you just did another let's say four more live webinars through the end of the year and sold that or we just like hustled out and knocked this out and made another two, five to 10k, who knows? the potential for 10k is pretty easy if we really work quick and but I think this would be so much more joyful. I don't to settle for anybody else's stuff. I think that this is a prime time for launching a product like this.
00:31:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what did you sell up for? Oh, just I just said it's 97. It's normally two 97 early bird price. And I said, Hey, this also probably become a $1,000 course because I'm adding to right?
00:31:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think what if you kept selling it at 97 the end of the year. And on January, let's say fifth, right? So that people have time to get through the holidays and make a last minute decision. It's 97. But at that point, it goes to 147. And we don't tell them, we just tell them the price is increasing. Period. End of story, never to be this low again. And we can let it just, you know, microscopically kind of increase to 147. But if you already got that many sales at 97, and it was kind of by the seat of your pants, granted, your pants are brilliant marketer pants.
00:32:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
they're not average pants, right?
00:32:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but the sales page is . going to admit that.
00:32:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
The delivery and the content is amazing. Like that's where I spent all my time. there's probably 12 hours and just two hours of And I both know the ugly converts and words probably were not should be on the page. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I did have cell the screenshot, some of the people's zoom comments and she stuck it on the sales page, this more, a few of them.
00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, not average pants, that's a long thing.
00:33:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I understand, yeah. And I did tell them that I'll be coming to them within seven days with a very small survey for their feedback, make this course even better, but also in little testimonial contests where they can win a $500 reward. So someone will win like a one hour with me. But I definitely want real testimonials, not just in a zoom comment, but like someone either emails me or leaves a comment on Facebook, on my post, or they send in a video testimonial.
00:33:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So here is a, obviously I've had no time to think this through, but what if, and I don't know how your, your viewer listed, but you're getting, you're getting, how many of the people that came to it, came through you too?
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you know? Isn't that interesting? Yeah, you know, I tried do a little poll. I'm not like I did an official poll who has a YouTube channel who doesn't and 80 percent of people have a YouTube channel who came um but um I would say uh probably out of the 30 people I would say 10 I was really surprised that they came from YouTube first joined school I will say that so then the school could be at five bucks a month uh and then school and I didn't really again I would say a one out of ten effort um I just posted a couple of posts to join the YouTube class um and that's really it so so I think even more could have came from it so that might be an interesting funnel YouTube videos to a school low low price you know five bucks a month thing to that your other digital offer
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that could be something interesting, play it at work as well.
00:35:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Which, when you think about it, is what I think Hermosi is really teaching on school.
00:35:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could not care less about that guy, so I never even think about it. Oh, I know, I know, know. Funnel idea. And that might be wrong because maybe the better funnel idea is we stick with what we're talking about. We send them to a low ticket offer or a webinar. No, because it's already worked. Yeah, it does. Thank you. you. You, you, you, in less than two weeks of having this idea specifically, and this offer, as far as I know, you've only had this particular offer for teaching YouTube profits that you've been talking about for just two weeks. And that's correct.
00:35:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two weeks. That's correct.
00:35:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you, you, for sure, there was Facebook traffic and there was YouTube traffic. And I think you need to banish the low ticket in terms of like less than $97. I don't think we have to go there. I think we want to go there later to spend it, but right now. how if we want to maximize eyeballs and profitability and also energy and the fact that you got 30 people to say yes at 97 in two weeks they have to warm up to the idea that's pretty powerful those are powerful signals so let's mimic what you already did so it's YouTube and Facebook to school to sales page to live webinar or ESL or other webinar drop it and turn into that what what
00:37:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, what what what this for yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, we we could really capture the whole craziness about school right now. Um, know, there's so many people that are intrigued about school because of Alex Hermosi and I have to say it was easy.
00:37:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like even getting stuff up on system IO, there's still always pain in the butt, whereas I have to say for a lot of people delivering knowledge and coaching on school is probably one of the simplest software plays ever.
00:37:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Why instead of getting more complicated right now, why don't we just do the YouTube class and course on school?
00:37:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you can unlock that like that can be its own paid thing. Hold on, let's go into school. Yep. Yeah, right now I a Black Friday toolkit that is locked.
00:38:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, everybody's already there.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I should because you put me as a admin.
00:38:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I did. You are an admin in mine. What if I change it to business accelerator? But I kept the make money with Maria online there for now because what you and I need to talk about is if we're going to probably start a new YouTube channel around this new brand of ours, I could record the setting up of that channel as part of the training material too.
00:38:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, why can't I? I should see it and make money online with Maria's doll. Yeah, okay, so classroom. Yeah, so the YouTube thing could be in here or we could create a whole new one for an extra $100 a month when that's one of the customers out of 30 you already sold. So like we can make that investment and it be worthwhile and and so and they'll see it and you can link to it Here if we have any other courses we can link to that. Why don't we just stick with school my Sorry, man my my brain just goes in and out when I get a rush of pain and heat Okay Got to catch my breath for a second Um So I like speed of implementation and I like minimum viability for new products. Yeah long term I would like to build out a robust system that does really good Nurturing and that's what I think high level is great for. Yeah, I have to take time here. I'm sorry. Hold on My body is going through it. Okay, um, do you just can come and just resurrect me right now.
00:39:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'll be okay with that Okay
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, with that, Jeez. Come on. So, yeah, so minimal invincibility, it is an extra expense, it's, I mean, a go-high level is $300 a month anyway at an agency level. you know, we could put that at, like, 2, 2025, where, okay, now we've got a community, now we've got people, and we could just start, instead of migrating people over, we can offer them, say, hey, we're migrating, but basically, live in both areas until everybody dies off here, or we moved over and can incentivize them to move over, because you get lost when you try to move people to new building, right? already got subscriptions going, and that's not good. Yeah. So, anyway, we could do that, but in the meantime, this allows us to teach them quickly into fulfill what's been sold and to nurture them, and then high level would be part of the larger master Sound which is first of all kind of automating the teaching experience with the follow-up Hey, did you check out this you know module one? I noticed you didn't check it out. Here's what you should what you can do for blah blah blah which takes a lot of time to write that kind of Engagement nurturing sequence, but we'll get more people to consume the content More people to get results and really help us to make a bigger impact which also then creates more brand awareness We'll sort of mouth all that but in addition to it then we can start working on expanding the You know the marketing and the business growth and upgrading right so higher value higher price and But also now where you can you will have money that we will have earned from here like like let's set a goal hold on so if we're talking about the beginning of q2 in 2025 that we've made 80,000 through this by then. So 40,000 for you, 40,000 for me, but let's say we set aside 10,000 for each. So maybe like we set aside 20% for business growth includes marketing systems teams forever. And then we just put that in a kitty. And it's, it's, you know, but high visibility, you see it, I see it, we both can see it. you know, you know, we know exactly where the money is at, at all times. And we have weekly updates on finances and total transparency. And not because either of us have any concern, but because that's just a practice. don't allow apathy, we don't allow any kind of temptation or anything to create that. I'm not worried about it, but the thing this, as soon as you stop worrying about stuff like that, you know, the adversary is good at what he does.
00:42:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And he can, he can twist people.
00:42:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we just want to make sure that we avoid that opportunity and have total transparency on a weekly basis. Anyway, so you set aside. 8%. I think there's, for sure, I think we could do $80,000 by then. But even if we did half of that by then and have the whatever other income coming in and manage the resource as well, move it to high level, launch the bigger thing. We've got a following, we've got people who should automatically upgrade, even if it's 10% and even if it's 10% of let's say like 300 people and not, I think that that's conservative. Based off of the 30 you got into weeks.
00:43:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:43:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, let's just kind of write it down as like a. Let's see. So, would we start from scratch, a new school community, or what do you think? I think you do because then you get it branded. And you can really use branding power, give it a very specific name so that people who are curious. Let's just about and then they watch the sale. video that can be right there on that page.
00:44:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And and and I think it's good too, because then we can keep it specific to the like people search now in school for stuff. And obviously, if they searched anything to do with YouTube, they wouldn't find me.
00:44:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one guy did say he's sorry. I said right.
00:44:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. But one guy for the make money from me online, he did search digital offers, and that's how he found me. That's how he joined. So I thought that was cool to hear as well.
00:44:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So my brain is going by myself. I'm just going to this is going to be all over place. Q two.
00:44:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:44:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Level. Whoa. Okay. Now. Okay. Hold on a second. Oh, yeah. That's how this works. So let's see. Road map. Whatever. It's different than that, but we'll see that. So Q4, new school group dedicated to 97 a month, YouTube, of course, price, goes back in January. What's the what's the first Monday after the first week of January? January 6th, or was I at trouble? This is it? January 6th, 2025 and we'll One, four, seven. Okay. Huge. Huge.
00:46:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And.
00:47:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, this is kind of capturing what we were talking about. So, we're talking EK by March, 20,% in growth accounts for those units. So, that's it. etc. Okay, so that captures what we're doing. So now, in the meantime, what what we need is to figure out what can we do and like what are you willing to do? What do you want to do? don't know how exhausting was to do that that life call. Do you want to do another one and do it like in two weeks from now so you have some more time to build it up and we just like build out a marketing campaign and devote some money to those, whether it be YouTube ads or just...
00:48:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think we could because I still think 97 is a good price point to cool traffic. Yeah, and we just have to... Yeah, I mean, we'd have more testimonials too on sales patient. Pretty powerful. And literally, we have no upsells or downsells or order bumps so can imagine how much money... We could make. Um, yeah, I'm game for that.
00:49:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's plan that out too. Okay, so, um, um, um, plan. We'll let be another live webinar in two weeks. So, um, so do you want to do it two weeks from last Saturday?
00:49:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, we can do that.
00:49:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
we'll just check in this enough time. Oh, I mean, you did that crazy fast.
00:49:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, no, teaching is not a problem. It's more the ads for in the sales page. Because my thought processes, do we keep it in Sistine.io or do we move that to your high level account?
00:49:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, so what I think we do is keep the same thing while we're building out the back end and delivering the content, sell it the same way you sold it. So, we're not over complicating anything while putting out the long term strategy, but that allows us to just. been to making money now and kind of just refining the process.
00:50:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Okay.
00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um, so that was, that would be November 16th. And man, I'm kidding. Yeah.
00:50:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry, my brain just checks out. No, no, no. Um, and we can talk more about tomorrow because when I do paid traffic, I like, I'll cry if we don't have an old bump or an upsell.
00:50:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So let's, let's just kind of think about that real quick. And I think that, um, you could have that be, um, you know, it, maybe it is just an upgrade of another $100 a month, but then they get access to a higher level group and you'll answer personal questions, like we don't have to overcomplicate it, it could be critiquing, it could be like, you know, what are the typical upsells that? Oh, go ahead.
00:51:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I misunderstood. Um, I never liked selling anything recurring on a funnel, that type of traffic. So, well, except the $5 a month was a no-brainer for the school community, but so I was thinking that the current system, Iowa, um, pages for $97 one shot. So, so that one would have the order bump and the upsell because school doesn't allow order bumps.
00:51:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what I'm saying is what, what could be offered as an order bump so that we're maximizing on that.
00:51:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, yeah, um, I gave away so much, unfortunately, in the original thing. So, um, and if we're gonna keep it at 97, I don't think I'd want to take anything away. So the natural thing for especially an upsell is anything that accelerates that. Um, so, Well, usually it's templates, but I really kind of give away the templates they need. I can't I think I need to think about it.
00:52:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, Yeah.
00:52:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I mean, one thing I think that would be cool for them to have, but I don't want to deliver it is like once a week working sessions, like, you know, how you show me that one time for ADHD owners, but I don't want to deliver on that. don't want to, as an empath, that just kill me.
00:52:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I go through your templates and figure out what is still a good stack, but what can you separate? So that it doesn't have to be a big upsell and and also remember, you know, we're testing. This is what testing. So if we find that person's drop because you took something away, yeah, then, you know, we revamp it and we we learn. Um, but if if go ahead, I know a really good upsell.
00:52:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If we took out, because I don't know why much that sold on the sales page because I didn't really make it clear or talk about it a lot, but what would make a good upsell is something called the automated YouTube growth stack and it's us teaching them how to hire a VA, how to manage them. Here's the scripts. Yeah, like here's the SOP you give them, like the stuff that I was going to do in scribe anyway. That would be an amazing upsell one.
00:53:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Higher VA scripts you give them. Remind me something else.
00:53:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, a standard of frame seizures so that they literally can just give them, hey, here's the research and planning SOP. Go plan out four videos for me, you know, for this month. Here's the how to upload a YouTube video SOP, you know, go do this for me. Like it'd be systemized by the process.
00:53:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about this also?
00:54:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yes. Yeah.
00:54:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so you and I, like, you know, yeah, we could do that. We could knock that out pretty quickly and we could get it done in two weeks. Yep. Um, I'm the kind of person who will stay up all night in the middle of the night to meet a deadline. And, um, I would rather not do that, I 100% with, like, I'm, I won't promise something and not fulfill it. So, um, I can't.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know, that's how I work.
00:54:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, that's how this YouTube thing got done.
00:54:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I didn't have pre sales of it, it would still be.
00:54:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I should do this course. I know, but I want you to know that that's who I am too, because it hasn't yet yet. And, um, because we're talking about an aggressive timeline. And I know that you know that there are a lot of people be like, this is cool. Let's do this. And then crickets. Um, yeah, you're the one pulling the all nighter and doing that kind of stuff. So I want you to know that, like, I'm, I'm game for this. This is a sprint. And for me, you know, you kind of suffer for sprints a little bit and then you, you take break and so holidays are coming. That'll be a good break time and we will be able to coast through that off of the, the high of having served and delivered really well and we can spend, you know, a couple of weeks at the end of December, just really nurturing the group instead of creating anything or doing any webinars or anything, just spending whatever time that we are working, nurturing people, taking care of them, answering questions, letting them get to know us and the mama bears, like we are, um, and, and that can be where our personality and that part of the branding kind of comes through. And, uh, I think that that would be great. So, um, this. Yes. So. I don't want to. Oh, gosh. I got to go because I have to get ready for this call. So I think this was amazing. I don't want to laugh because it makes me cramp really bad.
00:56:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Okay.
00:56:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So if we meet tomorrow, even honestly, I don't even think that we have to meet tomorrow. We can just start working. Man, why am I losing my breath? my asthma is bugging me really bad right now too. So, so let's see planning. So if we figure out what has to happen to make these happen. Yeah. What, like, what would you create? So the Trello board, like, I can create something, but all needs. some stuff to plug into it so I can see like, you know, what are you thinking? then I'll be able to riff off of what you create. But right now, like, I, there's a blank canvas in my brain. And so I'll a I'll do a quick loom video for you, because honestly, just face off the checklist in the Google spreadsheet, because that is my process. So, yeah, um, at Maria, please get me a transcript. And so we can start with that also. And so that should tag you. And we are going to have more tasks come out once I get that. And once you start with the the SOPs. And then we're going to be busy. Let's see. I would love to see if, if, If we can get a good turnout for two weeks from now, I would love to do it one more time while we're thinking and maybe take that best recording and turn it into an auto webinar.
00:58:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh yeah, that'd be cool, yeah.
00:58:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or clip it and make VSL out of it or something like that. then we can script out and maybe make a better video and then talk about our own YouTube channel. But in the meantime, if we want to capitalize on making money, the fact that, you know, there's this end of the year buying, there's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the new year, you, all these types of things, then rather than try to make it perfect right now, let's just show up, you know, two more times, which is easy for me to say because I'm not the one showing up to do the webinar, but I think that as long as you're not overwhelmed with the rest of the work, that's kind of like an area that you like doing and you've already done the research. So I build an support for you in in between those times, I think it wouldn't be too much. But let me know if I'm wrong.
00:59:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's talk about it, you know, throughout the week, because I might. Yeah, because Sally started performing pretty good on on some of that funnel work for the other clients. So my time might be more freed up than I thought. So let's see.
00:59:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:59:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:59:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, in terms of like, would you be willing to do two for live webinars, one in two weeks and one four weeks later?
00:59:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, when you mean live webbers, you mean, itching the thing, like people.
00:59:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, what you just did.
00:59:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, absolutely.
00:59:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. if that is something you're willing to do, and we do all the rest of this stuff, I think that that the revenue will come through that vehicle without a lot of complicated stuff while we build the fulfillment mechanisms, then we can build the automated leverage sales mechanism where you don't we're not doing like. webinars. We're doing either auto webinars or VSLs or creating a separate YouTube channel that is a magnet for leads and to this funnel anyway.
01:00:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So simple and it's all because you did what you do naturally, just creating videos, doing research, discovered a system, wanted to teach it, and this blossomed out of Maria just being Maria.
01:00:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and so the only next thing to talk about, mainly miners, how to manage my time because now that I'm doing more of this, I'm more visible, I'm getting a lot of messages in my Facebook messenger, hey, we should connect. what about this?
01:00:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hey, I had a consult call few months ago, I'm thinking of in the most. should read that you can. So even if it's just audio voices and dumps, like these are the scenarios. These are the things that are coming up. I would like help with figuring out how to handle this. So right now I have a vague idea of what it is, but they claim I am on exactly what's happening. Okay. You know how to have some people, let's just do this, this, this, and this. We'll not available, blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And just to handle it, because you don't need to do anything other than this and take care of the one guy that you have.
01:01:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So that's what I'm thinking and also just I don't want to also ruin good karma because some of these people are potentially good people for next year if we want to have one high ticket client for quarter one on one, you know? Right.
01:01:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then we use like, you know, I'm filled up until this time and this is what's coming on. Do you want to be at the top of the list? And if you do, it requires a deposit. And if you don't, No worries. I'm just reached out to me. if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. And I love it. And nobody gets offended by it. People do get offended by it. That automatically lets me know there were too much of a diva to work with anyway.
01:02:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And thank you very much. Yeah, yeah.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Perfect.
01:02:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
you.
01:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I'm so glad that we were able to talk. I was totally looking forward to it. even though I'm in miserable pain, I got a shot of vitamin M.
01:02:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
it was good.
01:02:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay.
01:02:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Awesome.
01:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I loved it.
01:02:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right.
01:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Talk to you later. Have a few better. Cheers. Bye-bye.

> 00:00:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're so quiet, but yeah, definitely. Are you there?
00:00:11 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:14 - mark sweet
We're good.
00:00:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sure? Why are you so quiet?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I'm always quiet. Most annoying thing. the way up.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not always the same kind of quiet, though. You have nuance to your dynamics.
00:00:38 - mark sweet
Yeah. Interesting New York Times article. Well. Uber is trying to put on the ballot in Nevada. It's easy to have that happening. To cap attorneys fees at 20%.
00:00:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:00:58 - mark sweet
Because they're getting sued left, right in the center for. having their drivers aggressive or people. so their solution, instead of, you know, doing better, is let's make it harder for people to bring lawsuits. Because originally they were forcing everyone to arbitration, but then there was so much backlash they stopped that. Yeah.
00:01:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What are the odds, do you think, of that passing?
00:01:26 - mark sweet
Um, not small. It's a short answer. Because they have people telling others that during, I think, 80% of the fee, and so this will stop them from taking more. And yeah, I don't think it's very hard to put together a campaign ad saying, stop pretty attorneys from taking all your money.
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so two things, and only one of them really matters, I guess, for you. Well, okay, so these are the two questions that pop in my mind. One, how can a law firm stay in business with that and two, then how do people get any help from attorneys if there are no law firms who can afford to do business with them?
00:02:19 - mark sweet
Well, first, this would only be for work. What it means is there's by going to be excess costs. like, okay, this fee is just for the attorney's time, not for the paralegals or whatever, and they charge separately to try to make us a difference. Yeah. It's just going to get, I don't want to say shadier, but more complicated.
00:02:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:02:48 - mark sweet
So, I mean, there's always a workaround. The question is going to be what is it? Uh, institutional arguments, I think as well. know, how can you actually cap this? But federal law does have a cap on the attorney's fees, so it's not like it doesn't happen.
00:03:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's precedent, but what is the federal cap?
00:03:09 - mark sweet
I think it's 25%.
00:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then how do you get 40% attorney fees? If there's a federal cap.
00:03:19 - mark sweet
That's only on federal cases.
00:03:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:03:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, only on federal cases.
00:03:29 - mark sweet
So the only other states that have a cap. Really or equal one has it at like 50% one has it at a third. But yeah, we can go up from that. So we'll see what happens.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how let's see. We don't even have any Nevada cases this month yet. Okay. Off the top of my head can't think about how many cases we get in Nevada.
00:03:58 - mark sweet
We don't really have any Nevada cases.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, that's new. It was one of the newer ones. Okay.
00:04:05 - mark sweet
Um, Will it immediately have a direct impact on our business? The answer is no. Just, you know, future proof. The Nevada firms will then continue to look to expand other states like Arizona and Washington and potentially California. So there's kind of the back and forth. So that's just what it means. Um, so move the Midwest is still better for us to try to build out.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, yeah, and probably in a lot of different industries because the Midwest just, I mean, the Midwest is like the Old West. It's just, it's like, or the Wild West, it's still, I don't know, it's like it's America 100 years ago, almost in some ways.
00:04:57 - mark sweet
Yeah. So, I mean, this is at least two years off. Okay.
00:05:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:03 - mark sweet
And then I, I guess.
00:05:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dan, the, the thing was that Nevada is trying to pass some law that caps attorney fees at 20%.
00:05:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Time to start Arizona firm. Let's go.
00:05:20 - mark sweet
Well, why are everybody just came up because the Arizona was serious about it, but there's an even more out of state firms coming in, which they're already pretty pissed off about.
00:05:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean. Well, and that's why, I mean, whatever the industry is, it doesn't matter what it is. The, the way to, it's not, I don't believe in future proofing, but, but trying to, but is, is to have the leanest business and the most optimized business possible. Whatever those systems are, whatever those. processes are, and I mean, the attorneys need to be thinking about that for themselves. You need to be thinking about that. Nobody knows what the timeline is, but whatever the most optimal process is, if you're not thinking about that constantly, which you are, but that's the thing. There will be some other companies that will be doing that and other ones will die, but the pace of change, first of all, is fast, second of all, it's getting faster. So continuing to look at what we can optimize, what we can systematize, how we can better use our resources is just going to be the thing. And then how we can duplicate across locations like we're already working on. So what is the, I have to go back. I know I have notes, but Utah, what's the situation with Utah update?
00:07:00 - mark sweet
Brad left the law firm that he was with and joined some new law firm so we're still signing cases I just got to make sure we have the new routine of the new law firm but in the cases he had with the previous law firm it still is so what Dan we haven't talked about litify reports what's his name is like on vacation for a while what are the latest updates on reports do you know yeah now he did this calls thing for me based off of what I brought up like two weeks ago about like I'm trying to figure out like I don't know what I'm trying to figure out trying to figure out if there's some sort of really
00:08:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
relationship between call volume, can we look at call volume over time? that opposite time? Does it say the same? And then how does call volume, if any way relate to retainers matters, right? So he busted out this report, I think he sent it over on Thursday on Friday. So Stacey, well Stacey has been, so must have been Friday. So she's like, Hey, you got to look at that, get back to Josh, but I've not looked at him. And I don't, I don't know what I'm looking for. It's more like the date is there. Is there are there gaps? I don't know. And or that it could be nothing, right? Just because the way that intake works. I think there'll be some relationship between call volume probably, but I don't know. But all the other reports that you wanted, all those are done. So all are they right?
00:08:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. Yeah, that was the thing about that.
00:09:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and last time and um no he picks those so it's like now we have to review the updates okay so what's your new report called uh i don't even know if it's a report it's um some call thing it's probably not it might be a dashboard but i don't know how he did it or it didn't lit up by so it's probably it's either a reporter a but i don't i'm medical ubering right now i'm going to pick up my patient it's another lovely money of me driving average call to convert source to state type there we go that's it um so what's funny is he did i was like i want to know this and then he was like oh you want to you should look at it like this i was like yeah sure you do that we'll see if that i wouldn't even know
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, okay. Automobile.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think there might be nothing. That's the whole thing. I don't know that there's going to be a damn thing.
00:10:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I will let you look at that then. Can you look at that before I call next week?
00:10:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:10:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm stuck on this 20% thing now.
00:10:20 - mark sweet
So, it's like, yeah.
00:10:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
no one will adapt, right? Is what I think. Most will not adapt. So, they will, they will die. So, they're not even going to, they may not even know it's happening. But I'm sitting here thinking, okay, if you run the math on 20%, like you're out of business right now, pretty much.
00:10:51 - mark sweet
Right. Like, that would be lower or gross by about 60%.
00:10:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, like, do you plan to try to game out an inevitable future? Or do you try to like, what would it look like to exist in that world? And I legitimately keep thinking about an Arizona firm. isn't that the real future? And yeah, those, because I met with they were floored that I know you guys are going to find this hard to believe. So a lot of these law firms don't know their numbers. Like, you're kidding.
00:11:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So like, they don't have an average retainer value. So he's like, where did you guys get that from? I'm like, a calculator? Uh, not that hard. Hey, but, and they were, they were cool about it. So they just have cli plans over and over and over again that don't get the value of what they're bringing because they don't have any internal math whatsoever. So they're in the same sort of hamster be alive was on. When I had that business, it was like, you'd go back to them six months, theirs is short of period of time, ours was literally six months. And six months down the road, they'd be like, oh, didn't work. And I'd be like, uh, so you didn't sign or I would have the leads. I would start reading the leads to the, I go, so we say to this guy in a motorcycle, oh, yeah, signed that guy, yep, but it didn't work. No, I signed him. Okay. So it did work. Yeah. guess so. Oh, boy. And they're all just lawyers that I'm a lawyer. Yeah. I know. I'm well aware of what you are. So they, you know, they've got some pretty big firms like doing a lot of leads. And they get good conversion rates, but my argument to them is like they might not be making money because as we pointed out several weeks ago, they're signing everything. So they don't know what's what at the end of the day. And then if they don't track it through the end, they don't. So at the end of the call, the guy goes, all right, so if I ask you a question, go, yeah, if you were us and you had a legal agenda business, what would you do? And I said, I wouldn't have a legal agenda business. And he's like, what do you mean? And I said, I would go, I would start in Arizona from I would get involved with someone that could start in Arizona. And they knew what that was, but they were like, how, how do you do that? I said, well, I'll tell you how you don't do it. You don't go get a bunch of private equity and think you just put money in one end and money comes up the other. Because that's, you need to know all these things that we just talked about. And as you. No, that's hard to come by, right? There aren't firms like that. But to me, the model's real. It's just no one's done it, right? No one's actually, they don't know the math of, hey, this is the acceptable cost per retainer and this is the whatever. It's, you know, it's my my whole idea of money execution thing, right? those guys, the idea is right. They, you can't execute it, but and you, you do need money. But if you have money in the idea, which is all these people you guys have, it failed miserably because they didn't know how to execute. Now, whether and they probably didn't know how to execute from an intake perspective and they probably didn't know how to execute from knowing the math of what works, what's not, they thought they could just throw a bunch of money at it, get retainers, and ooh, money. Anybody thinks that at first? but it's like, Part of me is like maybe that maybe that is the play is to work or maybe you And I'm thinking of this right now. like maybe you go start an Arizona firm. That's not sweet love And you go hey, gonna go build I'm gonna go build this other thing on the side that doesn't that's the optimized right genius word the optimized version of this so There are no loic. There's a lawyer Right, there's no there's a parent. There's a parent. There's a pot and you go can I can I get you know How many Arizona leads are there right now? It's like if I could get Four or five Arizona retainers a month you can gain that out you can map that out into the future And see what that looks like and what does that? I mean, I guess you could just do that right now You don't need to do the thing because you know you have all the math and say hey this is what that would look like this is what the profit margin on that would be and then how do you throw that so it's almost like you build this parallel track if it makes sense mathematically and then that's probably a pretty future proof model in a world where every state goes to 20 percent or whatever like you don't even care so i'm like that and then just use that spurtly can you have more than one law firm for an attorney that's what i thought there was some kind of limitation technically no technically right well litigiously
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, would it be even a conversation risk wise to have?
00:17:12 - mark sweet
So it's not as simple as just open up a firm in Arizona.
00:17:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah.
00:17:27 - mark sweet
There's more that goes on.
00:17:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you know, I'm like, let's just gain that out. What does that even look like? What is the profitable is that for. Right. Or that, that idea. nothing great. needs to be a firm.
00:17:42 - mark sweet
Why would it be more or less profitable than what we're currently doing.
00:17:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Because you have close to no overhead.
00:17:54 - mark sweet
What?
00:17:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You knew it's better being in the case. I know, but it's just a spreadsheet, like what does that spreadsheet look like and if you can like build a model around the thing, what and it's real, so I'm just curious like what does that actually look like it's it's just like when it came up here in the that we're wrong, it's eventually going to come fight us in the because the model of literally selling a single or, you know, two products, whatever, like we average two products per person, you know, per car or whatever. And we were selling 20 a day and I was like, okay, the problem with that model was, well, if one day, 10 people show up. But I just made half the revenue and that happened. I would have it all the time. So then when I modeled it out as a subscription, I was like, OK, if I get the same amount of customers a day, the business triples is what I figured out. And I was able to create that spreadsheet because I had all the other data, I just had to map it to a different model. And when I did that, and literally I struggled for years, I just couldn't see how to do it. I was like, I don't know how we do it. I thought I was trying to build it in parallel, and I couldn't because I couldn't get enough data, and it just, it wasn't real. And then I stumbled upon how to do it when we were these jerks were trying to require us, and I had to do a bunch of math, and then all of a sudden I was like, oh wait, there it is. And then when I mapped it out, I saw, OK, I could do this for 90 days, we're in the exact same cash position we were trying to do. higher, except tomorrow, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed. And the day after that, I'm going to make 10,000 guaranteed because now I'm on a subscription. So that's what led me down that path. And then consequently, I didn't really see how much it would increase the overall gross business, but it did, like I said, it tripled. So here, it's like, Oh, wait, we have all the math. So let's build the spreadsheet. What does it, what does it actually look like? And then you can say, Oh, maybe that's maybe that's something that should be pursued. And then you then you get into the, well, you'd have to do this, you'd have to do that. But the it's real, the spreadsheet would be real. The math is real. It's what it's what the PE guys were missing. They probably didn't even have the other, but we have both pieces. It's just we have all the data. It's just not in a model. And it's like, whether or not you do it is a different story. But to know what it looks like, I think it could be would be interesting.
00:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, I just had a thought that I've never had before because of what you just said, which is, and I don't know if this is possible or probable, but probably worth at least the conversation, rather than, or at least, okay, anyway, all these different thoughts at the same time. But what is the possibility and or even just ability to create a separate entity, and a separate business model that is not sweet law, but that you own mark that is almost like a science experiment of the most optimized level so that you could, without disrupting and having to move all of this to modify and alter this giant organization compared to something very small with maybe just one attorney so that it's not you, not because you actually need an attorney, but one attorney that out to scale with multiple assistance and case managers across multiple states where we figure out the thing that we've been talking about which is basically an attorney less type model with much less expensive people working for you, one attorney so that it's not you, one that you're and it could be one that's already existing and I haven't thought all of this through but basically what if we build the model that we're talking about, aside from sweet law, very very small and see if it can be optimized and then scaled like we are talking about and take it out of theory and into practice and see what what could be done.
00:23:08 - mark sweet
So walk me through this a little bit more. Obviously, I'm certainly whatever else. They're now going to be court owners of a law firm.
00:23:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's- No, no, no, no. Not that one. No. No, I was just, they just were like, what would you do? I was like, I would do this. This is more about taking the the vendor model to give this vendor model and you're plugging it into, let's call it a traditional pre-lit firm. And now you're like, well, what if I plug that into a different model? Same concept. I'm going to go take vendors, but I'm going to run them into this Arizona firm that's using a model that is, like Tina said, this attorney list or this optimized firm. This idealized thing that, what is that? I look like, right? So it's like, how do you do it? And part of it is there are on staff. There is no Sam Tyler, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? So there's a pod maybe, or there's an optimized pod. And then you go, OK, this thing is getting this thing is signing five cases a month. And then you game it out, all right? Well, then in nine months based on the average on the average retainer amount, blah, blah, falling in $40,000 a month or whatever in month nine. And then it's kind of recurring, right? If all the numbers stay the same. So then it's like 40, 40, 40, But what is the actual profit margin on that? And I mean, we can literally do this in a spreadsheet.
00:24:51 - mark sweet
It could. So we're just making a parallel firm has its own intake, its own accounting, its own legal team.
00:25:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we're not actually doing that. We're mapping it out so that you could so that we can look at that and go Hey this things Got 40% profit mark like whatever. I don't know what it's gonna say exactly, but And maybe and maybe like maybe you don't do it. Maybe you go Maybe you invest in it or we get you know what mean? It's like it's not necessarily I don't know what the outcome of it is but to know the model It's definitely what the PE guys were missing and it's like maybe that's the right like okay So if it's a law firm that can have non-lawyer partners you have that But what if one of the partners was a lawyer but wasn't a lawyer at the firm right? Can you be mark sweet that owns a piece of another law firm and not be a lawyer in that law firm? don't know Baby to it, but you're still gonna have all the liability and everything else.
00:25:57 - mark sweet
I'm sure right But why is this any different than say taking a case building out a pod that is in Corona or whatever else they're giving 50 plus fees back two-thirds of you back whatever it is.
00:26:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well because you could get other people's money right so you don't have to fund it so then you can go get I'll just say Omar you go to Omar and go hey I got this thing do you want to invest in it and then and you're not coming out of pocket at all and then it becomes like this sort of a revenue thing I mean it could be bigger than that right once it's mapped out then you're like you're building this asset you could start a new brand yada yada yada but really it should be way more profitable but it's almost like I was on this call this morning and it's we're going through this idea of buying catalogs of the music catalogs of these independent artists that are dormant and And part of the math, like the example, when we were using the catalog makes $8,000 a month right now. Well, that's with no promotion. So I can buy the, we could buy the catalog and then it's $4,000 a month to basically pay the financing. And then, and then, so I was like, all right, so you get four grand a month. And then the other four grand, I'm like, well, what if we just pump that into promotion to grow the asset of the catalog. So it doesn't make any money. And it just becomes this recurring thing of we're going to just invest in the asset over time. Because in year five, the assets going to start paying out more. And then we don't have to promote it anymore. So you could do something like that where you're building this machine that's like a self perpetuating machine. Like, I don't know exactly what it would look like, but I would like to know, I mean, dude, I can. do the spreadsheet. have all the data.
00:28:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I might just make it. And you do that by next week?
00:28:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Probably. I would like to see, I would like see what it looks like. Because then it could just, it could be an investment vehicle. It could be this like annuity that you build around using the knowledge and basically the knowledge that you've acquired.
00:28:23 - mark sweet
But how is it any different than me just doing our intakes? I know what's coming through, you're placing a certain firms in the field is bad.
00:28:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you expand on that? Because you said that before in the 50 like. So first of all, I don't think it has to be a separate entity. But the biggest thing is that your model of what you're paying your attorneys is what's choking you the most. And that you probably don't have to like you could, I don't know if you could use assistance for or paralegals for most of the work, but that's part of the conversation that's been had. So if it was somebody else, they would not be, it would be almost like they don't even have any connection to the rest of the sweet law. They don't operate the same. They don't have the same kind of commission structure. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a separate entity. basically, some very different type of operation is what needs to happen because it's the model that you have right now that is not optimized. Nice. Hello.
00:29:42 - mark sweet
Yeah.
00:29:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You did.
00:29:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was my I'm always like, you're sick. there was a female voice that it was definitely not damn hard.
00:30:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. No. Soft and twist.
00:30:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So I love it. I love it.
00:30:08 - mark sweet
love it. Getting outside money. Well, I don't want see is like not a problem, but that's generally not the main issue. Plus, again, new partners, expectations, dynamics become a lot harder, right? Yes. Getting loans or lines of credit are easier, although obviously more stressful.
00:30:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I don't even think that's necessary. we're going to go minimum viable option, the simplest thing is create the model instead of, okay, so we've been talking about working towards building a more simplified model because we already have this big entity that exists the way it is. And there are multiple iterations and modifications in order to get that and vision. What I'm saying is, let's just create a new entity. It's not necessarily separate physical from sweetball. thought as a company. But it is in terms of the way that it operates, like it's an entity within an entity, with a completely different, you know, what do you call it? My brain at the moment is not working.
00:31:20 - mark sweet
No, we're saying just having intake the intake and referring out for the highest fees back possible from these other lawsuits, so you don't deal with the headache of actually running cases. And you just cherry pick the absolute best of the best, the best slam dunk.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I'm not saying don't do that, but I'm saying that wasn't what I was talking about. I was talking about almost the same thing that you're doing now. But first of all, an attorney that is not getting the same payment structure, because that is part of what's hurting you. And then in a sorry, like I'm in an extreme amount of pain right now, my brain is not working really well, so I need both of you to help pull it back to conversations that we've had before. But to the point of like Salko has talked about what you could do, I don't think it's not having cases and I but more of who's working the cases and working them up and how it's getting done because I think the bigger issue is your compensation plan that you're paying attorneys that mostly don't have to do anything like understanding that also part of their function is being a liability buffer because paralegals in case assistance don't have any liability. Therefore, they're not incentivized to be extra cautious to make sure that they're not doing anything that's going to get you sued whereas an attorney is because they have liability. So anyway, but I'm looking at what is the most optimal or a two, maybe two variations of the most optimal type of model that we could build, that we're not able to build in sweet-law because we've got existing expectations and compensation models. Anyway, do you guys get what I'm saying?
00:33:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I do, but now I'm thinking, wait a second, we can actually, like, Lorenz is the only person that works in Arizona, right?
00:33:29 - mark sweet
Hey.
00:33:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, there's some other.
00:33:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, so.
00:33:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
so now I'm thinking, thanks the new guy. You can, you could have, we can build two models, right? You basically have an Arizona firm right now for lack of a better price, right? You take all the money and that's going into Arizona now, that's operating as a current pre-lit firm, and then you con trust that against what if what if those things didn't exist and you would strip away Hank and Lorenz and yeah then you look at the marketing expense that's going there so yeah we can actually do this right now I'm super curious to see what that looks like because it should be a way higher profit margin entity or idea whatever you want to call so you're technically correct as it looks right now because like all of intake was under California payroll in California right yeah but we peel them out and say we know intake 600 bucks a retainer we already did that map so you just yeah but we did your map and it came out to a yours was slightly higher it was like six six forty or six twenty or something and then you we have the leak cost we have the average retainer we have all the things it's just and then we can put in It's like a left verse of this versus that. So it's like traditional pre-lit versus this other idea. And right, like you said, it's not that it needs money. That's just part of the formula, idea, money, execution, right? Sometimes it doesn't need any money at all. And it's more about like, you're talking about, it's really an exercise in what happens if this was executed differently. With the idea of like, hey, there's a future where fees could go down to 20%, right? And you could factor that and go, okay, now let's switch, let's switch, we know right now, if you switch the formula, you'd lose 16%, whatever you just said. You could then switch that formula in the thing ago. This is what it would look like. went to, it all went to 20%.
00:35:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One more thing to think about that, in light of that. And again, I'm gonna tell you right now. mentally diminished capacity. But is there an opportunity? So going down to 20% fees in Nevada, if that happened, and obviously it would take some time, and by the time that we get there, it may be a moot point if we already have a more optimized model where we don't want to think about this. But you may be in the position of investing and being able to do this by the time that rolls around. Let's say small firms just die off, but they are maybe operating in some of the smaller communities, and they've got word of mouth, and they've got, you know, all these lead sources coming in, but they just can't operate like that anymore. Somebody's going to try to buy them out. Could you do that preemptively? Could you, and rather than actually buy them out, can you, I don't know, like just buy their leads, be like, look, this is coming. When we get there, anyway, this is this is a very premature conversation to have.
00:36:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But because it's happening with Salka right now. I literally just thought that the same thing. the thing that I was talking about earlier with the catalog, when I talked to those guys, so right now there's a catalog for sale. It's 250 grand. I did the math. It's worth way more than that. It came up with this formula based on the streaming, just the streaming revenue. They want 250 grand, so I was like, we should go back to them with an owner finance deal, and they were like, what's that? So this 50 grand down, 6%, you get paid off in three years, we have the ability to balloon payment whenever we want with no penalty. So yes, you could then, part of this could be looking at these older guy firms, and you go in and you own or finance the acquisition of their firms, but really what you're buying is their referrals, right? That's kind of what Steve is doing. It's Salka's weirdly, sort of inheriting these firms. I don't quite understand how it's happening, but you could do something like that. And again, then you're just getting retainers into this optimized entity. you have no money going up for those retainers other than the acquisition, which is a fixed monthly cost of whatever it is. And then you can go value that firm with your data and go, because they're not going to have it. What's your average retainer value? I don't know exactly. But here's the average retainer value in Arizona because I've already had hundreds of cases here. So this is the value of your firm.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why I always laugh at that. Because it's a sad truth, yeah. Every time. Hi. What are you thinking, Mark?
00:38:58 - mark sweet
It makes sense. It's complicated, but makes sense. months.
00:39:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it's definitely different.
00:39:05 - mark sweet
You're just going to be with the cost pre-acquisition, you know, at the end of period, no matter what, whether it's a 20 percent fee, a 30 percent fee, a 5 percent fee, right? Yeah. It has to make some sense. The smaller firms may actually end up better off because a lot of their stuff is just bored of mouth referrals. So they don't have a marketing cost.
00:39:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:39:27 - mark sweet
So they may actually be the one that better off and say, you know, Ronnie, Sweet James, whatever else the board does, because they're marketing machines.
00:39:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Their margins are susceptible.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. sure.
00:39:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So, I think that's the next so are yours, right? like you are that to a degree.
00:39:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think the best way to have this conversation is with a map, with we can plug something. thing in of this is what we know, right? And this is, and then do some projections if the margins were this, if the costs were that, you know, this is what the output would be. And then talk about logistics of what would it cost to operate this? What is that, you know, the range high low in terms of expenses, margins, things like that. So that we, what's that? I'm talking to my Anyway, just to visualize and kind of wrap our heads around it, but also to figuratively and literally actually be on the same page, having the same kind of vision as to what it could be. Because I think that that is back to minimum buyable product options, whatever. And knowing that the longevity of being in this business requires. being optimized, and also knowing that if you were to modify your compensation plan, you're going to upset people, but they may not have anywhere else better to go, so there's that. But regardless, it will affect morale, it will affect productivity, so that's not really a super viable option. Then what is viable though is building a parallel business that was born optimized based off of your pre-existing information knowledge experience, all of that, and then build that out, and then you can either maintain them both parallel because we've optimized enough that it doesn't take a lot of your personal bandwidth mark, or eventually the existing model of sweet-law kind of fizzles out, dies out while the optimized model grows, gets legs and becomes what you wanted the original thing to be. I think that so much much of their, there is the, you know, I built this house, I have to live in this house. Not a, this house can be a rental property, I'm buying another house kind of thing, which is where I go.
00:42:14 - mark sweet
Can we talk about something completely separate and different? you. You know, we're in a small break, but any dance help with this?
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:42:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go.
00:42:26 - mark sweet
So yeah, Chona took a job with Dr. E, so she's going to be doing kind of regular hospital stuff and clinic work, but she's also going be doing personal injury stuff.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
So this is where it gets interested. I can't send her into my cases because there's a conflict. So when she goes with other doctors and lawyers, lawyers, lawyers are really bad on the tech front. The only industry I think that may be worse is medical. By far, so government or government. Now, this may be a really cool chance to try that money dot com CRM that I know Dan's been talking about a lot because they do have a HIPAA compliant CRM. The only issue with everything is going to be HIPAA compliance. There's no zapier that's HIPAA compliant, but there's a like knockoff that is. So what I need to figure out how we can build is like a Monday dot com. can do scheduling with VAs that can take the basics of a patient, know, age, height, all that stuff. Sets up a telemed appointment. Telemed is probably going to be zoomed hip up. 15 minute console notes get pulled together mostly from a tent with the information the VA has gathered. They put all the other doctor reviews it before sending it over to the attorney with the appropriate bill. If we can actually make this work, it would be something very easy to sell to multiple practices that do personal injury because there's not lot out there that is very good. Okay, but I feel like there's some you might put something about that.
00:44:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A bunch of high level is HIPAA. Okay, there's a bunch of people that do use it for HIPAA related businesses. So scheduling, I'll be done there, right? So they integrate with Google Workspace, which I think I'm not sure if that's HIPAA, you could definitely do the scheduling. Yes, you could use Zoom.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We'd have to find out if Zoom is HIPAA, probably is. There is a Zoom HIPAA that is charged more for it.
00:44:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And then what else, what else do you have to, so you schedule the appointment.
00:45:07 - mark sweet
So they also need to do some sort of reports and bills and traffic of all this.
00:45:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You can definitely do invoicing from within it. That's no problem. Then, you know, if there's. It would depend on what the reports are, right? So I just recently started creating my own apps that you like you basically I frame inside of high level. So as an example, for the thing that I'm working on with the music studio guys, we built this Spotify app that. It creates this sort of magic link that if a user clicks on the link, it launches Spotify and it's like, hey, follow me on Spotify. But then it also. kicks in their Spotify account, the album you choose, the singles you choose, the playlist that you choose, no, no other app does that. But it looks like it's just part of, it's called fan flowy. It just looks like it's built into fan flowy, but fan flowy is really just a white label of high level, like leave. So, yeah, if I understand, if we map out all the requirements, then I can go down a list and go check, check, check, check, check, and then you can determine if there's a custom app that needs to be made or not. And, yeah, it definitely sounds possible.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, there's, so needs is relative, needs because the function doesn't exist or needs because, because there's another opportunity where you are right now mark in building that. So there's something called SkyFlow, which uses OpenAI and different LMSs, LLMs, learning language models. Anyway, to make that data HIPAA compliant, and then there's one called Bastion GPT that is HIPAA compliant GPT service. But if there is, like so Dan's got Norio, if you have somebody who understands the code, if you understand what would make an API call to OpenAI HIPAA compliant, there's got to be some things, right, that it basically maybe has to reside on certain servers, has to have certain security protocols. And also, in terms of the communication being bidirectionals, so, omnid, what's the one direction? Anyway, so that data doesn't get fed back into. So open AI, so you can pull information from open AI, but it doesn't process outside of the secure server, so it stays compliant. Anyway, if you built that, then you would own the software service, that would be another revenue stream that you could have. we're on the precipice now, where even if somebody has it, nobody owns the market. That market is, it's a blue ocean right now. But in terms of having the assets to create something really well for that, just our understanding of it, Dan has a great coder that could do it.
00:48:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's a lot of people. Who is the end user? not a doctor.
00:48:42 - mark sweet
Like what is the end user's mix, right? So like a certain type of doc, like that part, I'm not sure. Yeah, let's go through stuff by step, because it's the problem. So, lawyer is usually sending over a patient.
00:48:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
do a lawyer or another doctor?
00:49:00 - mark sweet
Yeah. we're patient to, which is you've Dr. E for lack of better term.
00:49:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:04 - mark sweet
Before that patient sees Dr. E, someone's got to call and get some basic information. Right. Uh, name, height, weight, date of birth, all that kind of stuff.
00:49:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:49:17 - mark sweet
From there, if there's a personal injury component of it, the doctor's office is going to confirm, generally speaking, with the law firm that one, there's a sign lead, meaning the doctor's going to get paid, uh, to probably making sure the case is good. If you were a higher level doctor, not a chiropractor and scheduling that patient for a certain time. From there, you need to get the lean sign by both the patient and the doctor. Then you schedule the time to come in. Generally, if it's pain management, the first appointment, you can do a telehealth. You don't have to actually physically see them, or you can see them physically. doesn't really matter. If want scheduling, you want reminders, if it's to a location, you know, hey, here's where the address is, right, they can just click it and put it into their map really simply. Before the patient actually sees the doctor, it would be better that someone or a system, either a VA or a system, has those basics, this is what the person's complained about, this is their demographics, then they see the doctor, doctor takes all their complaints, reviews the records, and makes a recommendation, physical therapy, MRI, injections, whatever it may be, that's a report, that report and those bills would then be sent to the lawyer's office. All right, then you obviously have to keep some track of your AR, right, because that's what you're doing, so it would be cool to be able to see all the, let's see, cases you have with, so you're large, whoever it is, that gets paid, you're good on it. side. That way you can track how much you're getting paid by each lawyer's way, frankly. How much are they dropping? How much is making sense? Does this work?
00:51:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So that's, and so you're, yeah, and you're, what do they use nothing now? Or it's just some non-system paper and this and that or whatever.
00:51:21 - mark sweet
You use the electric, I definitely dealt with some paper. There's electrical medical record, but you know, the amount of personal injury they do right now is like less than 5% of their total business. The vast majority of what they do is health insurance. Yeah. know, you know, health insurance and what we do are not aligned in any way, shape or form.
00:51:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, right.
00:51:46 - mark sweet
So that's why I almost don't care what they currently have because I can almost guarantee whatever we're gonna put together is going to be a thousand times better.
00:51:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they would use it just for these. They would be like, oh, this is just for our PI work.
00:52:02 - mark sweet
But of course, as in everything, once we're gets out that, Hey, this is good. Everyone's gonna want it. Because it needs to work with the back end stuff. the biggest pain in the .
00:52:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. And then we're talking how many different it's pain management and chiropractors or it's just pain management. Is it multiple types of doctors?
00:52:25 - mark sweet
So for what we're talking or just a handful, he's just a pain management doctor that you some procedures as well.
00:52:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But he's just a pain management.
00:52:33 - mark sweet
But if this works, could it go down streaming to chiropractors? Yes, chiropractors are usually kind of the last month of the cheapest people. Like they don't have a lot of money, pain docs, neurology surgeons will want this because they don't like dealing with the back end and right now they're just hiring people or hiring VAs to handle it, which comes with those issues.
00:52:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then it would be like Dr. E or whatever, it is working with sweet law and and and or it's like not not 20 firms but probably more than one or one to five or whatever I would guess where do we have far more real yeah wow okay just think of the you I can't sit on my volume to one doctor because it looks funky it looks bad sure sure where the client lives that may not actually be an option yeah three from the doctor you're not going to asking with one more firm and Chona is now inside one of these places she will be starting September 1st okay I mean that's where it's super helpful is to from me specifically to like get someone that's like in the thing and then show me the saying but I mean I'm listening to you right now and I'm literally building it going oh okay yeah all right yeah I can think I don't think it would do it like this complicated but you're gonna be no it's literally just knowing what needs to be known, right? you rattled off these things. I was like, okay. And in my head, I'm like, okay, I know that's built in. We were just the thing about high level is like, it's, it's like a sort of, there's, it's sort of like an erector set. And you, you, there's all these things you got to use them, but you have to understand what you're building, right? You have to sort of have the blueprint and then go, oh, yeah, yeah, all these, all these pieces are in the box. I just got to do it like this. And then eventually it could be a, that piece doesn't exist. Now I'm going to go build it outside and bring it in. So far, nothing, I mean, and obviously we're not too deep in it, but so far, I'm like, yeah, this is all in the box. I don't see.
00:54:47 - mark sweet
All stuff that's off the shelf.
00:54:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
really. Yeah. And then you've just build, you build these custom automations and custom, whatever, you just, you just, we just have to put together the blueprint and then go, okay, now let's build that. And then the like SMS you don't we don't build that that's there But you write the SMS this and you write the automations and you set the schedules on that so right? Okay, yeah, I mean it definitely sounds plausible And then Yeah, you'd go after pain meds first so because then you'd have that you have the idea of you would build They called it snap, but basically it's like you build this whole File we'll call it that it's the pain management file. So you go. Okay. got a new pain management firm loop launch the file boom the whole thing's built and then they just they just fill in their name their address stuff like that and then you you Assasify it and you're charging whatever right you I mean We have pretty good idea of the value of it. So it's probably a high dollar sass.
00:56:01 - mark sweet
And you could also theoretically buy their paper.
00:56:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:56:07 - mark sweet
So you've got two different avenues where you can make a lot of money off of them.
00:56:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but I'm building it in somebody else's house, and you don't own the software. So that's you know, no, yeah, did. So do you.
00:56:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, no, that that's the beautify level. There apparently there have been people that have exited their high level businesses for very large sums of money.
00:56:35 - mark sweet
mean, look at point.
00:56:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's built in sales force. Yeah.
00:56:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's they're using the same model like there's they make money selling white labels. And then it's up to the white labeler. I think the problem with high level. I actually just went over this with someone the other day. The people that are making money with it right now are selling the drill. of you could build an agency. In my view, the people that are going to make money with it for real, are the people that build things like this, the litifies of high level, where they turn it into a service for a certain target market, and then they go occupy that market, and then that recurring revenue multiple is real. doesn't matter. Yeah, if you built a couple of custom things, that's going to make it look better. But really, if you want to sell that business, they're just buying the cash flow. And the cash flow is real. the cash flow is built on your brand that was built on top of this software, but you went in and customized it for pay management doctors. Nobody else did that. And then you went and scooped up 10% of that market at $9.97 a month, and it's like, okay, yeah, we'll pay you. And then your stick rate is three years or whatever it is, that's what people buy it on. that's eight acts in your own.
00:57:58 - mark sweet
And look, we know doctors, they're Not innovative whatever they have they rest it with no They are not innovative at all so It seems to line up very well kind of what we've talked about and again I don't know what we're gonna learn from doing it for a doctor or some good things.
00:58:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're gonna learn for our own stuff But right yeah, I can see Dan taking an hour to build this first me taking two weeks It's not that fast, but here's here's the other benefit of doing that I think that you're all see if we if we were to build that The way that you could optimize sweet lot even more because I think that you would have a perspective shift That would be It's just one of those experiential things like when we first really saw the data like you thought you had a concept of what the data Looked like and what your numbers were and then we extracted and actually had that and that was like wow I didn't realize things were that whatever. I think it would be the same type of experience where your perspective would shift so much about what you think is possible versus what you know is possible because you saw something like that in action.
00:59:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well that's like I was just thinking how you know we're looking at this 20% fee thing or whatever but and it's like oh thinking three years out well if you think about the call two weeks ago we arrived at this place that was three years out from hey man you need more vendors or this could go sideways and now three years out you set a record and that vendor went sideways and it didn't matter yeah I was like that's that is great I was like I love that I was like that is so awesome so now it's like hey is it crazy to look three years out is it crazy to consider this 20% thing no no crazy not to no yeah it is you do the exercise it's like okay and maybe maybe it means nothing and maybe you learn something and but I'm Other people aren't going to do it at all, and then that's their folly.
01:00:05 - mark sweet
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Look, in the worst, the worst case, we just built something else to make money. It's not a terrible situation.
01:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, and there's not a maybe you'll learn something.
01:00:15 - mark sweet
You're guaranteed to learn something.
01:00:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. haven't done a single exercise. You haven't gone. Wow. Yeah.
01:00:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, you always learn something even from the failures.
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. And you're just paying money for that knowledge.
01:00:28 - mark sweet
But this is the right doctor to do it because he's he's a good doctor. I don't think he's the best doctor in the world. He's a good doctor, but he's a very, very, very smart business. So someone will get it and then, you know, it's on the people.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So yeah, that's super important.
01:00:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, yeah, because most doctors are going to say no, or I like my paper files.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
01:00:55 - mark sweet
Yes, but OK, cool. But I want to bring that up before I forgot about it because it's going to take a little bit. it's together, but like Tina said, I think it's going to actually take dividends over what we do and could help us with some of our own, you know, climb follow up and whatever else we're going learn from.
01:01:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, speaking of that, I mean, I've built some crazy, the stuff we're doing for the bands and the, like, I've built some crazy stuff on high level now. And it's like, Oh, okay, I get it. So I'm like, Oh, yeah, I can see how to build.
01:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, my last note is speaking of doctors and technology. I just showed Fuji how he could like save a huge pin in his butt with chat TBT and he's super excited about something that he hated. So it's good. Evolution and technology is our friends.
01:01:42 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is he a chiropractor?
01:01:44 - mark sweet
No, he's pain doctor. So, Oh, he is. Well, right.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He's the, he's the other guinea pig.
01:01:53 - mark sweet
By the way, you know, he does not know about each one of those new jobs. So not that you would ever let anything prop.
01:01:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Nope. Yep. Okay.
01:02:04 - mark sweet
Yeah. So again, if we can make this work, I'm very sure who would you be someone who would be extremely interested in using it?
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, totally.
01:02:14 - mark sweet
It just makes sense. Um, although I know they're more sales force based.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:02:20 - mark sweet
Yeah. level of crossing would be to the extent of what just happened is, hey, there's something good, but that was very generic and I didn't talk about what it was. So if that's okay, if that's not, I'll just never say Mark or Fuji to either one of you. No, you can say more. been trying to build out systems that help doctors be less stupid. Um, and this is what we've done. And I think you would very much understand that.
01:02:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Yeah. I'm very, um, very shallow in any references to other people always.
01:02:53 - mark sweet
But yeah, wait for Dan to make more money and need to have less of it.
01:02:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm all for it. Everybody. Yeah. And also to have fun though, that's what's important, we get excited like our brains light up with this type of stuff, that's something to pay attention to, it's not just about making more money, it is about how we're doing it, it's the fun, it's the down loves puzzles, I love puzzles and cool people, so all of that, I think we're all in alignment with that type of thing, but we can't ever lose sight of that.
01:03:22 - mark sweet
So originally with Twilio, which is HIPAA compliant, and Zoom, which is HIPAA compliant.
01:03:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and it won't be far behind that other things get there very quickly, that's the other thing to pay attention to, is how fast the pace is, and that the pace is continually increasing exponentially, so what's not possible now is, and that we think is maybe five years or ten years away is like a year or two away at this point.
01:03:58 - mark sweet
Oh, and also the whole physical therapy people. They're asking me questions of how can I do their stuff that are considered in a lot of VA's and running their heads into the program.
01:04:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you could do is write up what those things are. I did take some notes with Bathum that I could try to get dance for you to kind of plug in, Dan. But whatever you're looking for, the specifics mark, having that in a document, email, whatever.
01:04:25 - mark sweet
You would say what Bathum pulls and then I'll just add to it.
01:04:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I will do that as soon as we get off the call.
01:04:31 - mark sweet
Cool.
01:04:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody have a good day.
01:04:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Have a good week. Word. Get me the Google ID mark. Do it. rip it off his head. I will do my math. Okay.

00:04:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Hi.
00:04:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not worth spending the time arguing on, so I probably have an extra laptop somewhere in her office that could magically end up in her hands, but it's not an Apple. It's as long as it's fast. I just care if it's fast and it should have solid state drive and like all the RAM and VRAM and everything else. Huh?
00:04:35 - mark sweet
That's fine.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you Mark. Thank you very much. I love you.
00:04:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
like you. The doctor, Dr. Rickwood, said he will get me one. I think he already ordered and that's Windows that could be faster.
00:04:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, just at the very least, like if it takes a while to do meaning, then it's inefficient and that's not that that time is no.
00:05:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I agree.
00:05:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It compounds and it costs too much to wait on technology that's inefficient. So you were, let's just do this because you sent me that message and I've got your notes about I kind of bullet pointed them with question.
00:05:17 - mark sweet
You guys want to talk together for a few minutes? Well, I just finished up one more quick thing that I do have to do. Okay, why don't you guys talk for a moment and then I will be back by in 10 minutes.
00:05:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:05:27 - mark sweet
Sorry.
00:05:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's fine because that's what I was saying we could do anyway. So, Okay, so the meeting I probably will ask a little bit more questions about but the insecurities, let me mute my phone about the male dominated nature of the meetings in the field.
00:05:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
mean Yeah, that one is that day I just feel less than and
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But one thing I would say, being a woman in a man's world, that is not the same as doctors. I said, medicine is the oldest and women just weren't even allowed, even consider a woman. It's too delicate, can't handle it, it's its own kind of thing and that is a long indoctrination period that's generational because a lot of doctors have doctors in their family. They're talking Ivy League and indoctrination where, you know, like it's a culture intentionally. So one of the best things that you can do is really listen in the beginning, even if you have good ideas and pay a close attention. So if you're meeting with the same kind of people often, you want to study them, no. who they are, know what their strengths are, know what their weaknesses are, know what their blind thoughts are, and formulate what you have to say before you say it, not reactive, which I'm sure that you're good at doing, but be strategic about it. I don't know how well you'll be able to be heard in something like that. But if the first few times you wait to say something that nobody has bothered to bring up or acknowledged, and you can say it clearly, succinctly, and in the realm of, okay, here is a problem, here's a solution, or here's a problem, and here's what it's costing us and why we need to have a solution, that type of like if you you'll be respected faster and waiting until you can do that will help. So are you going to be in a situation where you're dealing with the same doctor frequently?
00:08:10 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:08:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So the other thing is having so are there women around at all or just a few of them or none?
00:08:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So I guess in those two specifics and I that I said one is when I was with Dr. E and we go to the three hospitals that I have to go. We're in the doctor's lounge because we got food. We're in the doctor's lounge and I'm the only female there. Okay. became like like if I can like shrink myself I have that feeling like Dr. E though no he's a good person, he always include me like, hey guys, this is my new nurse practitioner, this is Chona, like introduce me and then I said hi. So, what is your body language and your eye contact when you're in that meeting? I guess, well, there's the two settings. The first one is on the doctor's lounge, so it's more relaxed, we're eating. So we're, there's just everyone is in different tables. I think, I know I was able to like hide my feelings of, you know, feeling little, but during the Zoom meeting, I don't have my camera on, but for some reason, I feel more, you know, less than in that particular space because they're talking, all of the panels are male doctors. and lawyers, and there's no women that speak up during that Zoom, and in general, I've attended a couple of them, and there's maybe two or three out of 50 people, so there's, you know, not a lie. But I guess, like you said, I think there's a lot of it being new. Like you said, there's a lot of people.
00:10:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what's wrong?
00:10:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
As soon as I feel more comfortable and in all aspects, like the main job right now is the one that I'm just, you know, to get the routine. The second and third, I don't know if you remember, like the main job, then the second of the PI and the third is Washington. That's probably going to be a while. I hope not. The second one, I have a new patient today and I was nervous, I think there's some frustrations in a way that I don't have a lot of control on putting the patient to the list, putting the patient on the appointment list. Even that I don't have that capacity and so I have to, there's multiple point people that I have to talk to and that's what frustrates me a little bit. I feel like it's inefficient, I feel there's too many hands and if that's what term but I had my first patient actually, actually it's marks that I am, that referred to us.
00:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, so I'm excited about that one, so there's something to think about is what you can do, like what are some of the things that you could do in order to feel more confident and strong? And I think and I don't know if you would be able to do this and maybe you can do it in breaks and later, but just write down some of the things that you notice. I'm gonna give you a lot of things actually to tell you and these are about mental fortification and strength. Also, do you like reading books at all?
00:12:41 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do read books now on my phone, but I'm still old school. I like to read not I'm locing on fiction, but that's good.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, do you like psychology books or the book or persuade
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Psychology is always. I think it's everyone's favorite.
00:13:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not.
00:13:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Some people are stupid. I love it.
00:13:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do too.
00:13:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I do too.
00:13:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'll give you a list of some books to check out. And if you don't enjoy them, then don't read them. Okay.
00:13:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, all your books would be good too.
00:13:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think you'll like this. So, and I'll tell you why I'm going to recommend them. But they have to do. I think they'll be very useful for you in the dynamic that you're in. Okay. There's a power dynamic always in play. And there's two values out of reading these particular books. that is number one. Know that there are people who are consciously employing these tactics so that you can be aware and observe them with the people around you and know who to write clearly. There's a lot of times as women we have intuition. which we can't validate and we can explain how we feel to some people but they'll be like yeah but whatever so but then if you go read the toxic she'll go they did this this this and this therefore this is who they are and what they're doing right and then it's really hard for people to refute you when you're like this is the problem right so like if you want to tell mark or if if there's somebody else that you're working with you can you can be very specific other than i i feel this way you can say i observe this habit this habit this habit that is um like part and parcel with this type of behavior whatever you know what i mean so you might laugh at the titles and i don't know if mark here's that but um one is called the art of war i think i've heard that before but i haven't read okay um the other one is 48 laws of power okay why robert green who's a psychologist i think And I think it's also 48 laws of human nature. And then he wrote a book called Pre-Swasion, which I think would be good. they cover a lot of similar topics, from different angles and different anecdotes. So the art of war is short. And it's very, the language is more like ancient philosophers. It's by Sun Tzu, an ancient Asian philosopher. But 48 laws of power actually breaks it down a lot and gives a lot of anecdotes and stories and how these tactics were used historically. The reason I think that it's so powerful is because when you start to see the behavior, you're like, oh, I noticed this person does this, and that person does this. And it just increases. So you have a background in psychology, but when you apply this psychology towards a professional dynamic, and you don't have just a professional dynamic, it's a specific dynamic of doctors. Doctors are for the average user unimpeachable, what they say goes for most people, and even if the person disagrees, they will capitulate. That is a powerful dynamic, and it's not questioned or softened, so that's what you're up against as just the foundation of starting. So for sure, there should be a warm-up period where you strategically just staying relatively quiet. Not playing small. I want you to take up space. I want you to lean in. want you to look with your eyes. I want you to make a comment. Like, you know, if something makes sense, you know, I want you to use a big girl voice and project a little bit, but not, you know, trying to be a man, not trying to be masculine, not trying to be hard, just in, in Chona's natural power, like whenever, so think about what you sound like when you are convicted and you feel like you're in a space where you can say exactly how you feel about anything. What does that volume look like? What does that body language look like? What does that stance look like? That is, I want you to be conscious of using that there, but only when you're confident that you know what you're talking about and that you have something valuable to say because this sooner that you make a strong, solid, you know, impression, that the better your opportunity to influence change will be. Speaking of influence change, influencing There's one more book that I would love you to read that hasn't it doesn't have nothing to do with psychology, but it's called switch by chip and then Heath and I can give you a list of these and write them down later and The subject about it is how to make change stick when change is hard and something like that but it It It talks about I don't know basically looking for what are the angles that you have? To use to get the change that you see that needs to be made to that needs to happen and How do you look for? you can leverage right so let's say you want to make a change and the first objection is We don't do it that way. It costs much money. It takes much time I'd have to hire I'd have to train. It's difficult. It's depending the blood mark love blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just swinging. We can't see if he's there, because he's not on video. Anyway. But that's the pushback that you get. So what you do is you basically anticipate proactively all of the objections that you might get, and before they even get a chance to object, you address them. So let's come up with an example of something that's today.
00:19:27 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
day. Yeah. So that example is with this new patient that Mark says, Oh, I have a being patient. And so he said, you know, he says, you know, you can call the patient at this time. So he set me up to talk to the chiropractor, which is very helpful. And you know, we just discussed a little bit of what he did to the patient so far. And then I hold the team, email them, I said, I need this patient, if you can please add this patient to the list as a telehealth, and as a lean patient, telehealth, under Dr. E. So, in the response, well, I said at a time clock, I didn't write a time frame on when I need the patient to be added. And by the time I need to call the patient, said, can you please add the patient? And then the response was usually with lean patients, we need to see them first in the office. But the thing is with this type of patient, we need to get them when we get them. So, I have to do what I have to do. Dr. does telehealth as a new patient. I guess the pushback was, this is not how we do things. Basically, that's what she's saying. So, I, my response was, it's okay, I spoke with Dr. E about it, but that was, that was my excuse, but yeah, I should have had a better answer and not always anchor in Dr. E as the reasoning or the final say.
00:21:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
so yeah, now, what would be the logic and the reason why it would make more sense to do telehealth?
00:21:29 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, it's more of, I guess more, I guess the reasoning would be to get them in our system as soon as we can, because some of these patients are hard to, well, I don't know, I just heard it from our, but some of them are hard to talk to, you have to, you know, so it's just a matter of, like, time we need to get them when we can get them, right?
00:22:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So one of the things that you might say is say, well, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, would you want to choose telehealth, and then you'd be quiet and let them answer. if they try to circumvent the question, the question was, if the option is telehealth or we don't see them, which by the way, this is the option and you tell them, you know, confidently, would we just not see them at all? Is that what I'm hearing?
00:22:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And I just want to make sure I understand. Right. And fortunately, the patient is a little bit of a, you know, special that's the term that marks use and she's okay, but finally, she agreed for some reason she agreed to come tomorrow to the office. So then I have to send an email again, can you put them tomorrow on the list? So I I sound redundant. I asked them to add today and then add tomorrow, you know, but to me, I got all 99% of my information that I need, and I just need the patient just wants a lot of hand-holding of the explanation, so it's actually good that she's coming to the office tomorrow, but I feel okay. Sorry, I just need to be okay, not conforming to their system right away, or I don't know if that's the term I'm trying to see.
00:23:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, there's a few different ways you can look at it. Do you need this job? Are you going to be just fine if you didn't have it?
00:23:54 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, especially the extra, I guess this is the second part of the business, I guess. being one, which is what I wanted to make sure that we are good.
00:24:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
A big part of this power dynamic that people are able to have is that they feel like most people need a job and so they will tolerate certain types of behavior because if you don't, you're gone or you're not life miserable. And if you know inside your heart, we're like, I'm either going to do it my way or I'm not going to do it at all because you don't have to have this job. And it is not the only opportunity for you and Mark to do an arrangement like this.
00:24:37 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
They're like something.
00:24:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you believe abundantly that there's going to be a place where you can fit without playing small or holding back, that will come out energetically. So, now I have been called a and all kinds of things many times, but I don't use this energy to plow over anybody. I do it because. My best interest is the company's best interest.
00:25:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
want to see everybody win.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to be clear. want to be frank and I need you to know you don't get to plow for me. So either I'm valued and I'm valuable and I'm wanted right because I'm not here just for paycheck. have things to do that are important to me. I care about this company. I care about these patients. If you don't value that. If what you want is a robot, I'm not your person. I am autonomous. I think I have things to value now. Do you have to conform to the system sometimes because the system makes sense? Makes the most sense is leveraged. Fine. Show me how it's leveraged. Show me how it makes the most sense so that I can buy into it and support it and get behind it. If you can't show me how this system makes the most sense and I have a suggestion that is good for the company. company and good for the patient and then I need to know I'm where that's going to be heard. You can't, I wouldn't say you just dive right in there immediately but I would say that you at least try to have that type of conversation because if you come in and play robot and then try to be autonomous that's not going to work very well. Right. So if you have a question, present the question. Now if you have a follow up question or follow up argument then you might think strategically okay is this the time for it or do I kind of progress through the you know the the barriers right a little bit at a time but basically every time somebody pushes back on me I'm just going to say okay but at least once this right you know so that they're aware that you're thinking about the process you're thinking about the value you're thinking about the system and It matters to you. Does that make sense?
00:27:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Yes. So Tuesday, I spoke with the manager by myself because I wanted to learn how their process works because Dr. E, you know, he's not interested on the logistics of this. He just he just wants to make money. But at the same time, I know he's a good person. He's a good doctor, but he doesn't want to, you know, diminution of like small things. he went, so he basically just dropped me off to the to the manager of the office and say, you know, you guys figured it out.
00:27:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if his priority is making the most money though, and let's say, let's say that getting the patient in the sickness is the fastest way to the money, right?
00:27:50 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That's why he he agreed because I asked him right away. He said, I have this patient, I get them and get them in. But then, you know, that's why he sent the email. Because he's in the OR today, so he sends the email to the people, the key people, and says, you know, moving forward, China will be included in all PI cases, know, CC her, this and that. And then, you know, I respond to that email, I have a new patient coming in, this is the info, please add it to the list for telehealth today. So that's how I said it, but I know they have a system that, you know, obviously I'm new and I'm still learning their system is something either I will have to conform and maybe adjust based on how I think will be more efficient for us.
00:28:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is a hospital, right?
00:28:52 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So it's a medical group. So this is clinic. So it's private, yes, which Dr. E Owens and he has. of a, okay, I have a, he have a manager, but he's just all over the place. I cannot rely him to just do the, I will have to drive this, because he's just nice and he spread himself to thin. He's just, I won't, I just won't have, he's gonna rely on me, basically.
00:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So doctor, I just want to make sure I understand the dynamic theory.
00:29:26 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Doctor E owns this medical clinic, medical, he's the one right, just him.
00:29:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He owes it.
00:29:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And so, okay.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he hired you.
00:29:35 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And we did that agreement with Mark and I.
00:29:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what is the scope of your stewardship? And let's let me break it down that way. Let's start that. What would you say is that you know clearly is the scope of your stewardship. What does he expect out you rather than just taking care of patients because you have a slightly different type of arrangement?
00:30:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So he wants me to basically wear different hats. Yeah. That's why the first two out of the three is with him with his medical group. So the first one, like I said, is the main main job, seeing patients in the hospital and clinic and calling patients is telehealth. That's the main job. And I get paid per patient on that one. Now provided he gave me a doctorate that's all great. So he's very generous on that one. The second part where the lean personal injury cases is where Mark kind of negotiated with me through him and with him with Dr. E that I get half, I get the percent of every patient seen. each visit. So let's say if it's a 500, each visit, I get 250. And every procedure that that patient does, epidurals, or any procedure at all, I get 20% because it's a patient or it's a client that comes from our sources, our meaning marketing, like our sources. But he has his own as well. He has his own personal injury cases as well, but he wants me to basically take over that as well. So, so he wants to urge that, but separate, merge, separate.
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me ask some questions though, because then my brain gets kind of stuck on logistics and then I can't really process anything else because I just like, wait, wait, wait, wait, what? so who pushed back and said, you, you have to see patients in person first.
00:32:00 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What was the role of that person. So he he's one of basically second to the manager.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:32:06 - mark sweet
So like Cheryl.
00:32:08 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, that is the one who says because I didn't text Cheryl because it's still early. I know she hasn't gone to the office, but I should have texted Cheryl.
00:32:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, your channel command is a little interesting. That's what I want to hear about.
00:32:26 - mark sweet
So the easiest way to make an analogy is Dr. E is me and Cheryl is married.
00:32:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:32:35 - mark sweet
That's the easiest way.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, but who did you talk to that told you no?
00:32:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She didn't. She didn't really said no.
00:32:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She kind of like who tried to say no.
00:32:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Reminder that, hey, you know, typically we see the patient in the clinic. She's led. The her name is led. So who's second to Mary Han? Is that Michelle? Yeah. so you know I think maybe again because I'm that person who tried to not bother people that much that's not your job it was nine o'clock ten o'clock and I know that Cheryl the manager doesn't really come then till one because she's a afternoon late type of person she works till 12 one to you know she's a she's that person so I try to be I guess consider let me let me just clarify mm-hmm you can either be the person that Dr. E wants to run things efficiently and make the money or you can be the person that doesn't bother people you can't be right and I email them at 10 a.m. say I have an incoming patient please schedule the telehealth under Dr. E so telehealth there's no specific time needed as long as it's on the list, I can click on it and chart on it. They can schedule at 3 a.m. doesn't matter. But comes 12 o'clock two hours later, it's still not added. And the call is scheduled at 12.30. So I just wanted to ask, can you add the patient? Because I don't know how to, it's on the back end. It's on their end to add the patient on the list. So that's the time when I text because I know she's there in the office already. So that's why that's the whole dynamic on that part. next time, I'll just text Cheryl right away.
00:34:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So something that would be really helpful for me is to be able to see kind of an org chart. Mark, maybe you can help with this. So I can understand what the hierarchy is and roles and responsibilities in relationship to and I will be able to understand your dynamic much faster.
00:34:59 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. It's really I mean, I talked her multiple times. She is approachable and not really at the same time. I don't know if it's just me feeling inept and, you know, not confident yet because I don't know the whole situation. I don't know the process that they have. still learning all through it, so it's possible that that's, you know, but I sent an email. I sent an email. I have that communication, but I guess, you know, email is not as urgent as text or call, so.
00:35:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that would be the other thing too, is just learning the chain of command and also the pace. You need things done and learning what gets you, what results, then just kind of observing what are the bottlenecks. if you need something done and it takes x amount of time, then maybe it only takes x amount of time If this person doesn't, and maybe it takes this amount of time, if this person does it, all the details about how things operate, how things operate individually by specific people, as well as by task. So if you have the most money-making opportunity, as well as the ability to feel confident in your own skin and in your role, the more you understand about the organization, even if you're not responsible for managing it, the more that you understand it, the more you will understand how you can, again, even if you're not technically responsible for it, you can have influence over it to make it go a better way for you.
00:36:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. I just know that Tuesday night, when I talk to Cheryl, the manager who wants to be on the loop for everything, you know, medical to the practice, which of course, she's a manager. And she's very clear that she told me she doesn't want to take another project, which is aka me, because she has a contract that's coming, they have a contract that's coming. There's 300,000 patients rolling in soon.
00:37:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:37:18 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So she's overwhelmed with that. And they don't have the manpower to like deal with that. And that's up in the air. I mean, it's not up in the air. It's just it's like an upcoming storm that they have to, you know, ready themselves, ready ourselves, because I will have to see those patients too. But then when he talked to Marc, she talked to Marc, I was there for a while. Marc, her tone change, because you know, Marc is very good in talking to people. And you know, Marc is, how can I help you? How can I make it better? You know, I'll float this.
00:37:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think this is a woman that doesn't like working with other women because there are plenty of those.
00:38:03 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I'm not sure. I think it's just a power issue that she wants to be in, know, wants to be on the loop. What do you think, hun?
00:38:12 - mark sweet
I don't know. I don't think that's the issue. The issue is their structure doesn't make a lot of sense. Yeah. pulling in different directions. It's a very, very classic visionary and integrator situation where it's visionary. Listen to me, know, listen to me. This is how we actually do it. And frustration that obviously boils over between the two, just somewhat naturally, if you use the word naturally, but you know what I mean. so the issue for Chona is she's got to kind of navigate a tight rope. Sorry, not tight line. Tight rope between these two different people who are pulling her in different directions, partially because her, the CEO doesn't deal with anything financial. So she really doesn't have any visibility in terms of payroll or who's getting paid what or what happens. That's all Dr. E, which makes all this even more confusing because we're just trying to suppose to go to. she's trying to serve two masters at the same time without taking any one off. My advice would just be have a group chat with both E and Cheryl, that way everyone's on the same page and sees the exact same thing, so there's no issue or problem, or E, Cheryl and Cass or whatever it is while we're getting to figure this out, because I can promise you whatever they're doing now is not going be what you're going to be doing in six months. Because there is no structure, and so he's looking at us to come in and help those structure put processes in place, but we can't just go and do that rough shot because Cheryl is really upset. So we have to involve her in the process, slowly make the tweaks so she can see how much better everything is. E starts seeing some money come through, so he's happy and then the process evolves.
00:39:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
But I just remember when we talked to her.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that we're not doing it right now and then now here comes a patient today so I don't know if she's not happy about that you know this this is a thing like I think like I like oh my god and she's probably not happy with this but it's only one patient so it's fine it'll be okay the biggest issue and this is always been my experience and I know Tina will talk about this when an integrator doesn't feel like they're involved and they're on the outside that's when they get really upset so this goes back to I'm gonna I'm gonna take this here Jonah because the fastest path path to liaising between those two roles when you're not even that is structure understanding the structure so I get that you don't have all the numbers but what you're going to want to do and mark you help figure out how we can do this as best as possible and it's probably conversation with Cheryl and with Dr. E and my Maybe with you. I don't know how how this dynamic works. This is you, but hold on, but so Somebody needs to frame and and chona you're new to this. So if this is not necessarily I'm saying do this right away. Okay, I'm talking about this will be the game plan and it will be understanding as much as you can about the system and how it operates what is fluid and what is friction. What that does in terms of revenue, right? Where are the bottlenecks? Where are the bottlenecks in terms of getting something accomplished in a timely manner and having consistent patients coming in and revenue and then also how is this stopping all of these things. if you are going to come in and make the most value, you would have to understand everything about the organization. That's going to take time, especially if you're not in a position where anybody would expect you to ask those questions and even when you're expected to ask those questions, in case in point somebody I'm talking to on the other side, the sign right here is they don't always want to have give you the information or they don't have it or don't know where to go get it or it's a pain. But to make the most change with the least amount of friction and problems with the least amount of disruption to the current piece, you're gonna want to understand the ins and outs of everything and everyone as best as you can. So whatever you can do to understand that asking questions, taking notes and then bringing it back here, bringing it back to Mark hopefully with the three of us, then we'll start to get some insight into, okay so for example when I'm working with people, the first thing I want to do is make their lives easier. So you would want to not just make Dr. E's life easier, that's but you were hired for it, but you want to make Cheryl's life easier and you need to understand what bothers her, what stresses her out from a position of, that's my goal, Cheryl, how can I serve you?
00:43:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
what can I do to help you?
00:43:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. then when she gives you a little bit of information, if you have formulated a follow up question, ask the follow up question. And if she's not approachable, then just say, Hey, is there a time when I can ask you some questions?
00:43:28 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
just really want to understand this because knowing that you run all of this, I feel like the best way for me to support him is to support you.
00:43:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that would be sincere. That would be the truth that that's that's her role in dynamic. And eventually, if you do it really well, and she doesn't feel threatened or anything by that, then you can have number one, a good ally that is just enjoyable to work with, but to actually getting good results. Right. you're new, there's a lot to navigate, but the fastest way to navigate it safely is to figure out the topography ASAP.
00:44:09 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right, so that's why I've been spending, because I know she's an afternoon night person, I would spend some time doing four hours with her, just talking, we talk about a lot of things, we talk about our dog, we talk about like, I'm trying to understand, you I wanted to understand her as a person, and I wanted to understand. It marked, you know, he talked to you too, and right? Yeah, and she helped with something. She asked me, because I asked questions, and I wanted to learn, and that's what I did the other the past couple of times, I've been seeing hers, like I wanted to understand not just the lean part, but the main job part, where in, you know, I can, I'm sure I will have more questions. It's what I told her, but I'm kind of like cementing that relationship between the two of us, because she is going to be that person, guys.
00:45:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So if you capture any of that in email or text, I would love you to share that here so I can help you. But maybe if she's open to it, if you're having a conversation, say, do you mind if I just record this so I can go take some notes on it later? You probably.
00:45:34 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Probably know.
00:45:36 - mark sweet
Knowing how she is, she probably won't respond well to that.
00:45:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, And she's super paranoid about all of this stuff. Yeah.
00:45:45 - mark sweet
What they do like is a lot of Medicare and grievances and all sorts of other things. Okay. So I totally get what you're saying, because you just don't want to have to try to remember things and write it down later.
00:45:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you take notes while you're talking?
00:45:58 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. Right. I can already.
00:46:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to take notes on what she told me about specifically on the number two, the lean patients that do. the thing you want to keep in mind is that as you're learning everything, your ability to manage and remember it all perfectly is probably not going to be great. When you capture it, then we can start to kind of categorize the data and formulate what you want to do with it, but being able to see it visually, taking it out of your brain first of all makes it accessible to us. Right. That we can help you. But second of all, it helps you sift through instead of having to, wait, what did she say about this? That's mental effort. That's exhausting when you add that to a 10 hour day, nine hour day, whatever is on top of that. Now you're trying to go be strategic after hours. The more that you write down and organize that data, the less your brain has to work. You've already got a lot. to do. So you want to manage your mental resources and your energy resources. So getting copious notes or at least very well organized main thoughts, you know, captured.
00:47:14 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So yeah, I mean, I can tell you what she told me based on the what they do because I asked her what did they come in from different sources, right? They have a big one, which is the now, Dr. Gannal Manau Gannam, but it's a big chiropractor group that brings them patients. So the moment it comes in, they create an email chain between cast, share deal, Dr. E, they put the patient's name there and the birthday. And then they will say this is a new referral from this attorney's office, and these are the medical records, please, you know, schedule the patient. And once the patient is seen, by that time, hopefully, we had the MRI because we're supposed to be this specialist. So they should have gone through the conservative therapy of chiropractic treatment and or physical therapy. So they have an MRI. So by the time we see them, they said that that's the decision-making of let's do an epidural or not. We can recommend a procedure, however, we can't do it right away until we okay it with the lawyers. So what they do is they email the law firm. So this is the other steps, like email the law firm telling, attaching the notes, which Mark said it's a no-no, but anyways, I'm telling you how they do it. And then they will respond either the lawyer, the case manager of the case, will respond says go ahead. you can do the the drill. So once that's done and they schedule the patient for an epidural or for any procedure, which emailing notes like that is not HIPAA compliant, right? Right, that's how they do it.
00:49:16 - mark sweet
It's not HIPAA compliant, it's discoverable in litigation, so it looks at the lawyers driving the care, so there's a lot of things that are right.
00:49:24 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is I'm telling you like what they do and how they do it.
00:49:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was just okay, that's good to know.
00:49:30 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
This is how they do it right now.
00:49:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One of the things that does though is it speaks to priorities and it also speaks to business understanding and just overall health of it and so that's what I'm curious about is we do it because we do it because this is how we do it. We do it because it's easier and faster to do it that way.
00:49:56 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh yeah, I need to do it that way, but yeah, you're paper trail, which Mark talked to them. That's not, you know, that's not, that's how it should not be done.
00:50:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But anyway, so that's how they do it.
00:50:09 - mark sweet
Sorry, can we just talk about this just a teeny teeny bit more. So part of the issue that they have and why they want paper trail is some of the loaders they work with are not great to put it mildly. so Bill, the loaders say, yeah, do it, do it, do it, whatever that is, whether it's injections or surgery or what have you, but there's not enough money to get that done. And then at the end, they will say, well, no, we didn't mean that we don't have enough money in this way. In Cheryl's eyes, hey, we have a paper chair, we said, do it. This is your problem. You better cut your feed to make sure I'm paid because you said do it. So I understand why she wants to say it's not like she's just trying to be lazy or problematic. Like there's a very valid reason for it.
00:50:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I mean, is it solvable by having a secure portal? It's just that email cannot be secure. So it's not the communication itself that is illegal or unethical, right?
00:51:12 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, this is the issue because if you're sending to the lawyer saying I need your authorization, that makes it look like the lawyer is trying care and that's why it's bad.
00:51:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, okay, let me just understand this real quick. The lawyer is going to say yes in policy limits, right? Right. Okay, so can we not make this correct by talking to the insurance companies and knowing what the limits are or getting those those limits like having the lawyer send a report on here's what's available left like is what is the way can't do this because two reasons one the insurance company doesn't tell you.
00:52:01 - mark sweet
Two, if that was sent to the doctor's office, then it would look like the doctor's office is only treating based on insurance, not over what the patient actually needs. I understand these are all things with stupid distinctions because the reality is what happens is the doctor will just call our office and ask, hey, do I have authority to do this, that, or the other thing? because it's a telephone call, it's not discoverable.
00:52:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:52:24 - mark sweet
Okay. So it's, it just is what it is. I, I, I'm just trying to understand it all, really.
00:52:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Question.
00:52:32 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's possible then that we can just have internally among us, like I spoke with, oh, that's discoverable too.
00:52:41 - mark sweet
Like I spoke. it's all discoverable to some level.
00:52:45 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, not see seeing the lawyer, not sending them anything, but whoever called that lawyer will have our own discussion, our own email chain saying this attorney, okay, to do this procedure for this.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
So when you get subpoenaed in litigation, they ask you for your entire medical record. If that is part of the medical record, you turn it over. So it's part of your medical records.
00:53:13 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Email is part of medical records, no.
00:53:19 - mark sweet
Email communications are part of your records.
00:53:21 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. not the records, yes. So I don't know then, how would we have a trail?
00:53:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What you can do is you could, and I might be wrong, but I'm looking for this. if the process is called the attorney and get permission, then what you can have is some way of selecting or just saying we don't write this thing down until we have that conversation. So if we've written this down, that means we've already contacted the attorneys and they've approved it. And one thing could be, Dr. recommends X. I'm conferring with patient or whatever and really what that means is I'm calling the attorney to find out if that can happen Attorney said yes.
00:54:06 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So patient is scheduled so how is the documentation is being done now is that We recommend patient will benefit from this and this Injection costing we say approximation of the cost And you know how many treatments needed or and or if it fails, you know This other procedure can be done with quotation of the quotes and it marks that it's okay to put that on the medical records So like something that you could do is that you put that And then maybe there's an indicator that somebody acknowledge it and is working on it and it could just be as simple as Noted receive something like that that internally.
00:54:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Everybody knows that doesn't go there until you've reached out to the attorney If the attorney says yes, you can do it then the next notation is Scheduling um or recommendation accepted and then you schedule it. So the language is not decipherable by anybody that I called an attorney and got permission. You just know that that happened. There's no record of it. But internally you would have to know don't do this until that.
00:55:19 - mark sweet
Cheryl's concern and it's a valid concern is it's great we have a phone call.
00:55:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the proof? Yeah yeah yeah.
00:55:26 - mark sweet
And that's going to be a problem. So they may decide that they would rather just run the risk of looking like idiots in litigation.
00:55:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's straight off. You have to pick a off. Yeah.
00:55:40 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Which what they've been doing in the practice they've been doing it for a while now. They actually have a lot of their own lean patients. This is how they've always done it. And now I'm learning through Dr. through Mark that this is not the right way to do it. Now I'm coming in trying to change the structure while Oh, not in the guys, but it's the truth is to make it more efficient and kind of offload that pressure from Cheryl as well. So that's where I'm coming in.
00:56:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah. So the questions that I would be asking are, what is the most expensive? So if you get litigated, somebody suges you because that's what happened. Number one, the company has insurance that can help with that. So what is the potential risk and what is the likelihood of that? Not that anybody knows that I'm for sure, but you could ballpark it.
00:56:34 - mark sweet
So it's not them getting sued so much. It's when you have a car accident case, right, between Mr. and Mr. Jones. And so Mr. Jones's attorney's only job is to make Mr. look like he's not really hurt that all this should have been resolved very quickly and chiropractic care would have resolved. And that Mr. Smith's attorneys are the ones who are driving this because Mr. Jones has a large. policy. He didn't really need these injections and surgery and everything else. And then so when defense counsel of Mr. has emails showing that Mr. doctor asked for the lawyers' permission to do a medical procedure, it falls into the defense's narrative of they didn't really need this. They're just doing this for the money. So my question is, but it's more difficult.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So my question is, what is more detrimental to the business? Having attorneys not paid for something that they authorized, so this is frequency and amount, how much is that up to or the cost of litigation for such a scenario is that? Which one gets more expensive?
00:57:48 - mark sweet
My guess is going to be it's more expensive by not having a paper trail because the attorney is that he works with it.
00:57:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then that's why. the systems in place and they're making an educated risk or at least a intentional, like, conscious risk. But- That's right. That's frustrating as that is. Yes, but I mean, but that's business, you have to make trade-offs. So, and if it's the nature of it, and that's what's more expensive to them, or potentially risky. So, will Chona bear any, could she bear any liability personally for any of that?
00:58:33 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, because everything's being signed by- Okay.
00:58:38 - mark sweet
So, it's not going to be tied to her per se unless there was some sort of investigation or the FBI came and raided it.
00:58:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it's not compliant. We know it. doing it anyway. All right, so we'll move on past that topic, yeah?
00:58:57 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:58:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, probably- prep so it's late and I will have to find a quick wrapping up thing so I gotta take my daughter again this is in the beginning there's just a lot of discovery and figuring out I would love okay let me think about if I were gonna have you read one of those books first which one it would be the 48 laws of power okay um it's it's dense but I think once you start getting into it you'll see what I'm talking about about the application and the second one would be switch um but I do think that you would enjoy some of the other ones and I'll all write them down but we've got a lot going on so yeah maybe she right now is trying to figure out how to navigate some of these interpersonal issues that's why I'm recommending these two books have you read 48 laws of power mark yes please
01:00:07 - mark sweet
I'm sorry.
01:00:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
didn't hear anything you would say. Have you read the book 48 laws of power?
01:00:12 - mark sweet
Yeah.
01:00:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. that's what I'm recommending that she read even though it's dense because understanding that dynamic and all the different people. I just think it's a good book overall. But I know what I was explaining to her is watching how you might notice some people applying particular types of tactics and be able to recognize and identify specific behaviors and mannerisms and know who you're dealing with a little bit better because you'll recognize those patterns anyway. Okay, as well as how to navigate it. But also just some insight into like what to pay attention to and kind of choose your strategy for how you want to insight change as well. as how you communicate your reasons and logic behind the change that you want to make. So it's all strategy but the on a personal note and just being able to enjoy the place that you work understanding people, understanding how to serve them while understanding their motives, understanding how you can help them accomplish their motives as long as they're good. you know and be of support of those around you and knowing that all of that enables you to serve two main missions which is helping the client, patient, get what they need but also having your own success, personal success in leadership but also monetarily so you can earn that money which allows you to do whatever other things that you want by your life. So it's um It's not a fast, simple thing. really have to be conscious, mentally. The more notes that you take, like I said with everything, just even thoughts that you might have.
01:02:11 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
you gave me that voice message today, and I transcribed it and put it in my notes so that I could save it for later.
01:02:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll do that in the future because everything that you notice is probably useful and it just kind of helps you get your bearings. Like I said, topography. Once you understand where you're at and who you're dealing with, then you can understand how to navigate it better.
01:02:36 - Chona Sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
01:02:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Depending on my pace.
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good. When did you start doing that?
00:01:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, well, I'm talking about it. Since everyone's been driving.
00:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
little bit, huh? Yes. You didn't start driving right away though, did she?
00:01:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, she got her license last October. Listen to that. Yeah, so she held off. So actually she had to wait. So she got her license like October 10 or something. So soon after that. But I, you know, walked in a couple of times in between whatever reason.
00:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
at that, like, moderate climate so that you could walk frequently.
00:02:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my god, this is covering that with Mario. Like, you don't understand how you are. Wait till you go somewhere else.
00:02:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that is the being about existence right now. crazy weather.
00:02:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it's actually hot here today. But like for fear, which is not really hot.
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, what is it?
00:02:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I don't know.
00:02:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would say it's the 80s. I I'm going to look at a brand name. I get cold in the 80s. like it in the 90s. I'm happy in the hundreds.
00:02:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I'm worried about that or the whopping 70 for it.
00:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, oh, that's hot for here.
00:02:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That is hilarious. That is hilarious. Um, how where have you gotten on the Marsha stuff? I'm like halfway through another one. Start the wrong one. So I'm gonna try to wrap it up today and start another one. This one's going sort of quick, so it's not. Yeah, so this is still like planning, understanding like it's like deeper into the planning portion of the framework, which is good. So I was like, I'm just gonna go through it all, just to don't miss anything. But yeah, like halfway through. Probably like six more videos, but these ones are all fairly short.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what are we doing? Good. What have you like, have you had any aha since last week?
00:03:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is Dashboards like this? yesterday. His dashboards are sick. I'm oh my god, they're so good. So he'll make like, he's big into Ikea. It's information, questions, actions. And then he has this other thing that he calls eyes on the journey. So the journey would be like a sales page, right? So he his argument is that there's a journey on the sales page. It's broken up into three eyes. So eyes on the journey is like a little too far. So it's like interest, no, impression, interest, interaction, something, something. And what he does is he sets different events for each. guy. So impressions, super simple page view, and then interest might be, they scroll 50%, and then the next one, it's not what I thought, but that won't be, they hit, they saw the pricing table, and they were there for 10 seconds or whatever. So he was firing these events for each of those things, and then he has like a visual funnel in Looker Studio of that page, and those steps of the funnel with like a breakdown of, hey, X percent did this I, then this I, then this I, and then that's on the right hand side, and then on left hand side, it's all the metrics broken out, so that you see like, oh, your conversion to interest, you had a hundred visitors in your conversion to interest walls. 12% of whatever it is, so that's all correct because you're supposed to be forecasting that already, right? That's part of your plan. Part of your plan is okay, you're either gathering the data and saying these are my baselines and then you're going to try to beat those. That's basically where I'm going to be at. So you just set all this stuff up and start capturing and then recording and learning. Like, hey, these are, this is my opt-in rate right now. Well, if I increase that, the action would be like, I want to increase my opt-in rates. Okay, great. this is what it is. What are you going to do? the action we're going to take, and then what's the outcome that's affecting. But he does that for multiple journeys. So there's like the sales page journey, the cart journey, the opt-in journey, the membership side journey. See, it's all these different... dashboards set up and they look fantastic I'd love to see those so Andy gives Andy gives to you he's like here's all the graphics here's how you build them but I've got no part I showed them to someday they were like oh my God who is this?
00:07:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
oh yeah I'll show you yeah I can give you access to the course to it that's the thing about being the type of people that we are that kind of necessarily are jacks of all trades like we get into some stuff but you can't do all the things really well all the time but when you're meeting the business you have to do a lot of different things like so for example split testing heat maps using split testing software like improved or what was the other one huh yeah visual Yes, so those are things that I used to do and set up and then ended up with, so I was doing them in coffee shop millionaire, well, what year is it, 13 years ago? Or before, a little bit before that, and then the, so that was Anthony Trister, and then Manish Punjabi, which nobody really knows. known kind of behind the scenes like you. And then so Manish and I were working on split testing stuff and he ended up partnering with Justin Christensen and they created conversion fanatics and I was working with them in the beginning. So that was like stuff I did a ton. On the same time I met Mercer was speaking at a little tiny mastermind event by this guy named Jared Elvitch who's also very like hush-hush but was like a mentor to Ryan Lee. The what do you call it? I don't know almost like incestuous bar. Oh yeah early days. Yeah but this so like when I ask you numbers and data and stuff like that I we only spend an hour together week that's the one thing that I kind of miss in being in the businesses more is having more time to really like look at data, set up the systems that capture the data. You don't really, you don't have an optimizer. And especially now, I think, I almost think that that's a role that everybody everybody should have it. But after, you know, at least one million, but probably more in the two four million kind of optimizing. Obviously, you can get there better. But I'm also thinking about the logistics of how many things there are to manage in a business and how much skill a person has when they're first getting to that, you know, even just breaking that six figure mark. There's a whole level of understanding difference between finally getting to that threshold and finally getting to the seven bigger threshold in terms of comprehension of the not nuances, but the facets of business and online business. And then just getting into the next level of it. So to the point of like, you wanting to increase your market share one percent and having determined how much that is being at the, you know, between three and four million spending time doing this, if this was the main thing you accomplish this whole year, is having a system like a really solid optimization system for all of these aspects, right? So there's the landing page, the checkout page, which sometimes is the same depending on what you built it with. Um, if there's an order bump, but then even the thank you page and the download page, which you've been diving into are people even getting their downloads, that type of thing. There is so much, you can't optimize what you don't know to, right?
00:11:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Literally, I was just going to say and people tried to do it all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Like he calls it, he was calling it like he runs into people all the time. And he's called it the curse of a good offer. So that guy's getting offered a throw. up and they throw it on Facebook and they're spending 500 and they're getting a thousand. And they spend a thousand and they're getting two thousand. It's like, then they're like, oh, we got it. Then they spend 10,000 and they get nothing. And they're like, wait a minute. Something broke. They don't know where to look because they were never looking. So, yeah, that's true. So, I don't have that problem. The problem that I have is that I'm not talking the thing. I don't know where new customers come from, but that's my problem. And that's my also the solution to my other problem is how do I get more market share new customers? How do I get new customers? don't know. If I sell one the second, then I can try to sell the first.
00:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So, well. keep digging in.
00:13:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah, I just got I got some stuff I'm gonna wait for Mushy to do some stuff. I'm usually soft change her API so he's writing a bunch of our legacy custom code that we have and then when he's done with that he's gonna help me do this custom stuff that I figured out but I just got to wait for him to give me the high sign which could be like a little bit too but I should be further along. Good thing is going through these courses I haven't been like oh I'm doing it wrong where I'm coming.
00:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You haven't been doing it wrong but because you do keep getting muffled in and out and like garbled.
00:13:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just that I haven't changed I know the thing right it's like I need to figure out where new customers come from.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think that's going to change. And they're and I don't know the answer so Now I might be surprised by the answer How much time do you figure you've been able to spend each week on this stuff on the Marshall stuff on just yeah At least six eight I don't even know how to like I've got kind of double questions in my head, which is Do you have any desire to increase or maintain that pace and at that pace? At what point do you think you'll be done at least getting through more stuff and are you building as you're going through it?
00:14:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Are you just absorbing? There's been nothing to build yet. There's been no You hold method. That's next. I think next you go in and you actually set up Google Analytics 4. So I think that's going to be me going in, watching all this stuff just to see that I miss anything, right? For instance, he talks about cross domain tracking. I know I used to have that in GA. I do not know if it's in GA 4. I also do not know if it's that I'm saying or different or I don't know what. So if anything like that's missing and then I'll go implement it or it's there and everything's there and then I'll just have a better understanding of what I've already done. So I just set it up and I'm like it's working. I don't know what I did. I got used to work. But like there might be, oh this is like Keith's run out some words for like elements of GA 4 and I was like, oh I didn't know it called that. Okay. So stuff like that.
00:16:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I don't think I heard the answer to, well, I don't.
00:16:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do I want to do it more? Yeah, sort of part like that quote book. I should have, I was going to take a picture of the quote so I have it. So I'm going to murder it again. But the quote this week was like, you should only be working on high value tasks. Yeah. One of the high value things, so every day I get up and I read that. I'm like, yep, I gotta stay on this Mercer tracking. So, I mean, I would like to do more of it part of the part of the problem right now. No is this puppy. I get saddled with this puppy all the time. I'm like, guys, you're killing me with this puppy. Like, yeah, she's very cute, but she's, she's a huge distraction. Like, what are you doing? What are you doing? So I just have to break away and get something out of or whatever. My child brought home a baby duck. Oh boy.
00:17:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And she got she tied up for me and she did for a few days and then I went into her room. I was looking for something and I heard this little squeaking. There was a duck. A little fluffy yellow adorable duck that either raccoons or dogs will eat.
00:17:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So what's she thinking?
00:17:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. No, I'm like, you don't get to keep it here. But in the meantime, she's waiting until she goes to her dad's for the weekend and she can keep it there. But but anyway, I was going to ask. Speaking child. Why are you bragging about that right now? Um, I had a question. Oh, okay. So, um, I don't think anybody's ever talked to you about. Staying focused on high level activities before.
00:18:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you sure?
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I've talked to myself about it. New content.
00:18:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Dan. Yeah.
00:18:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, like, is that a leveraged activity here? Like, I don't know. There it is.
00:18:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, that's my argument for me doing it. Like, I mean, I already tried this, right? already made my classic lunder. had Eric go through the GTM thing. He went through it. To what end? But did you learn that thing? You get like, no? So, it was like, I can't, I mean, this is the whole thing, right? When I look in the Mercer, and watch Mercer does, I can then go 2 plus 2 equals 4, right? I can then look at whatever business it is and go, oh, I know how I can get that there, because this is how this one works, and that's how that one works. So, I'm watching this stuff yesterday, and I'm like, oh, I would love to know all this about the Wolf Hurry Sales page. I would love to know this. What is happening? Because that's a leverageable point. Hey, have these numbers. We start to forecast and say, and his forecasting is crazy, too. We forecast, like, impressions to the page, opt-in, right, month. We'll have the forecast, and then it's out for 2 years in this spreadsheet that scrolls sideways forever, and at the end of every month. They fill in every metric, they go, how do we do this in turn? Oh, well, look, our impressions were off. Bump-a-bump. Meanwhile, they can go to the report, the eye on the journey report, or whatever they're forecasting, and drop a hat and go, well, how are we doing today, right? So I could do the today thing all day long and know that we're on track, off track with another 71. But I don't look at impressions. I just look at the outcome. So I'm like, oh, it would be interesting to see, like, our impressions changing over time. Like, I can go look at that, but not in an easy, digestible, snapshot-y, dashboard-y way. So I'm like, yeah, all right, that would be good. And then it's super repeatable, then it just would become, especially for me, because all these businesses were the same in a way. It looks like, oh, yeah. If I just build this once, learn it, then can I then just task it and say, I need you to go build an eye on the journey thing for this. And they know, oh, it's all these events, we've got to set up these events. That's the part that I don't know now, but it's JavaScript GTN, like 90% short, which I have personally never used. But it is a thing. Oh, no, we have used it. We've used it for the video time that we did. That's it. Which we could put in a dashboard. You what? Which we could put in the dashboard that we don't. It could go on a dashboard. It doesn't. So for me to really see what's going on with that, I feel like do these weird reports and an active campaign and like, it's not exactly what you want to see, but it's a wave. for me to use that data to find out the best way.
00:22:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's I'm just kind of contemplating the path to this because. So, and I'm trying to think about because you had wicked reports for a while. Because I asked questions about this stuff many times and the question will be like, I don't know, like if I ask a particular metric about a website or the sales page or whatever, where's this, what's this number and I don't know. We've had conversations about dashboards and what I'm trying to figure out is what I. And this is not necessarily relevant for you because we're here now. But like, and I hate when I have so many questions going through my head at the same time and so many thoughts because it can't come out and then they have to be linear, but they're not linear anyway. But the knowledge that. It's hard to impart from my mind the visualization experience that I have of seeing this type of data and having built archaic systems and spreadsheets to track this stuff for myself for different things in the past and then helping somebody, not you per se, but let's say it's a maybe, well, and it wouldn't matter because you'd be doing this for them anyway with basis. But that every person running any kind of business online needs to have a dashboard with basic metrics. to me, what Mercer is teaching is so far beyond what everybody's doing, but it's also basic. Like, these are basic KPI. How long are people there? How many people come? Where did they come from? from like, this is what white heat maps have been around for so long, but almost nobody uses them. Where are they getting paused on the page? And then, but looking at all of the pages that matter, so landing pages, all of the sections of the page that matter, how like, they're still not really a good provider of that for smaller businesses. I'm trying to think Neil Patel has stuff, but he's not affordable to everybody. Mercer is not, is so complicated that most people aren't going to go through this or understand it even if they do, but they'll be fried before they even get to most of it. If there was such a need for a, don't even know what you would call this, but like, the website optimizer type person, like a person who is just about the data, who either directs or does all the work, I say direct because they don't necessarily need to be the one that installs the tracking codes and installs the heat map codes and any of the code on the pages, but they need to be the one that says I need this code, they need to be the one that can validate that it's working because the reports are coming, they should be the one that would be kind of masters of dashboards and knowing what types of dashboards we need, that there are different types to look at so you're not looking on a ton of data like we've been doing with Letify, like there's the intake dashboard and then the matters dashboard. Anyway, thinking about the, which is anyway, just how there should be a role whole for you. it starts though, it starts like this, it starts with knowing what you don't know from first 10 experience by learning through it and going through it so that you know how number one's even just create the like rudimentary version of what is needed but then so you're informed and know how to hire somebody for this role because you have enough knowledge to be able to engage in a conversation where you can evacuate it and know what they have access to but anyway that was a really long way to get at there's there's a way that we need to leverage this moving forward and apply it to anything that you're working on any project that you're working on and then also for me in the back of my head like pretty much anybody I'm working with needs to be doing something to this degree and I have not done a good job of Being able to relay First of all, what's even possible because this is not new the stuff that Master's talking about is not new He's been talking about the same stuff for at least 13 years.
00:27:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have this At breakfast one day But it's Right the great part about his stuff like my stuff is He did it for himself So he's like, this is exactly what we do and this is and we learned our way into this. So I'm like, okay You're right. mean, this is like a total bolt-on to basis and You know, I would the reason people Don't or can't offer this as a service really is like good luck Good luck going into some random website and and being able to just easily At all this code and at all that like no Not gonna happen Yeah, and I actually think that's too hard.
00:27:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It hasn't been streamed by yet is because I doubt you would remember me bringing it up in the beginning, but one of the things that we talked about in the beginning when we started talking about data is how unreliable it is, which we did, I know you would remember that part of the conversation, but in that one of the ways we could validate it would be that all the different data sources disagreed with each other. Like visual or website optimizer versus improvedly, different stats, even if we've got both the code on there versus Google analytics versus wicked reports, whatever, nothing ever reported the same thing. So you know that there's discrepancies and then who's right? Is any of them right? And then if they're right, what's getting in the way.
00:28:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's a bigger problem now than ever. That's the that's the thing that this advent of GA4 and the advent of these pixel blockers or whatever is that attribution has become more difficult than ever right so but my argument is that if you are in a world my world where I can drop a first party pixel I am fully integrated with I have the full integration with segment tricks 99% of people can't do either of those so I'm like okay I have all these things I'm the dude that Mercer described as I have been a collector like I'm collecting all the data and I'm collecting the data that has meaning but I've been as you know as I've been complaining about forever like I can't connect the dots like I can't see the things that I want to see and now I'm like oh this is but this is Show me some things that I didn't know before like, okay, I can get some data into Metarick and I can get some data. So I think between like GA4, Metarick and Segmentrix, which might not even be needed, but it's there. I'm like, I'm going to be able to get an attribution picture that no one else can get. And then Mercer, I'm positive, is going to nerd out on that. He'll be like, what are you doing? And then, again, that becomes something that like, oh yeah, no, you can only get this with basis, right? That's it. And it just, it's like things are getting more complicated. And so, and if the data becomes less reliable, then you can't make data-driven decisions. And as we know, if you're not making data-driven decisions, you're really just guessing. And guessing only works some of the time, most of the time does work.
00:30:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:31:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And like the good job is in the click funnels and the go high levels of the world like they're not gonna solve it Yeah, but and then this is not meant for It's not meant to be like a mass product, right? I told it's funny that the development like to the general public Yeah, well, yeah, I mean it's it's not Truly scalable like the more I think about it as I'm going through as far as I'm oh, the price needs to be even higher It should be like it should be prohibited to get on it And like no if you want to get on this you have to understand What you're getting on and it's like you want us almost?
00:31:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
shy away the people That can't that can barely afford it because they're just playing and not get it or whatever Yep, well and because it's a it's a Longer runway to And that means that there's constantly a burden of having to prove the value, which is why they're complaining, right? Because if they knew that they were putting in a dollar and getting out to, nobody would say no. Right. when, and this is, so there's two components to it. Number one, people that are doing, you know, multiple seven through the gears versus not less than that, there's, there's corollary data points, which is not just their revenue, but also their traffic. And in order for to collect enough data to be relevant and, and to be able to analyze it and get something useful from it, there has to be a significant amount of traffic. Or you have to wait a long time, but either way, so, so when they've got more volumes, they're doing more cells. They probably have a lot more traffic, which means we get to the data faster, which means they can see the correlation faster. And then all of that data leads to a split test, right? So here's our baseline. What's the point of doing that if you're measuring it, if you're not going to improve it. So then, you know, and if you're going to improve it, you don't just do something and think, I know for sure it's going to work, it's a split test. And then you run the test, but obviously there for it to be conclusive, you've got again, volume. So that's another reason why only offering it to people who have a certain level of success, traffic, sales, whatever, would be good, especially if you're just like, I don't know, proving out the concept, getting case studies, Glenn never had enough traffic. Jody out, he didn't even have What's that?
00:34:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
think he did. Well, he didn't hit a personal website. Yeah, totally. Well, I've got like, they're like a, they've got the right stuff and they're on it. They'll be a good case study. Joe, like with Joe, it'll just be like, what are the metrics that matter for a podcaster? once you know what they are, right, like you leads and listens, whatever it is, then you build the dashboard around that. Once you know, I mean, you're going to have like this funk of JavaScript that you're going to par you's over and over again, you're going to get chat GPT to be your little, you know, I have Eric building these assistants where it's like, hey, this is a vanilla JavaScript assistant. And then this one's a Gutenberg JavaScript assistant, and then this one's going to be a GTN JavaScript assistant. And you just keep running the same types of code into the thing. You're like, all right, I really wish you those could get smarter, but they really can, but whatever. I mean, yeah, it's like, You can, if it works, right, of course, you know me, I'm like, yeah, we'll see. I mean, it all makes sense, but like, I need to see it, I need to see it, and I need for it to have meaning to me. And I obviously know the power of data, right? So it's like, oh, okay, that's the other thing with other people, like, they don't really get it. Like, I was just helping someone out. And they're like, yeah, we're paying. They said, like, oh, God, we turn off the ads. We're paying $250 a lead. I'm like, how do you even know that? That's what Facebook said. Yeah, but is that true? Oh, I don't know. When I looked at like their CRM. And I didn't tell them this, but I like, I did some quick math and I'm like, I'm at 90. So I'm like, but I'm not sure. Like, I have to really like, you know, do a little scrub or whatever. D do bit. I'm like, yeah, whatever number Getting from Facebook is wrong and they killed their ads and then 48 hours later like we got to turn our ads back on Which never was Yeah, and I'm like, but you're gonna Do you even know which ones converted and they don't mean I know they don't cuz I looked and I was like you guys aren't Bragging anything. Oh PS. know, you've had this was great. I mean you've had five hundred inbound calls And it looks like everyone I looked at no one answered And they're like really I go What's going on? Like where are those going that no one answers 500 calls in 60 days? Like that's a lot of calls per day. Sorry, right? So they're like, oh And that's the word that sometimes that's a good answer and sometimes that's a bad answer in this case.
00:36:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
a bad answer You shouldn't know I Was thinking you know if you get to the point to You Well, whether you have this analytics type dashboard thing or not, either way, if you get to spelling bases, I think the best thing would be a VSL because it really is a visual concept. think about all the exercises that we've done and the reason dashboards are so powerful. Like, we can talk about the numbers, but unless you're a savant really processing those without a chart, know, kind of seeing visually a relationship between this number and this number, it's hard to wrap your head around it the first time you see it, the second time you see it, the third time you see it. So if you're just trying to explain to somebody like having a sales conversation, they'll see, you know, just a portion of it, whereas if You say, like, before we even talk about it, you've got to go watch this video. You can't get on, you're not allowed, you don't get access to this, I know you've heard great things, it doesn't matter, you can give me all the money in the world, you cannot come here unless you watch this video and the video, like, we had the leaky bucket kind of visual that you've made to explain that to people and that was an aha moment for them. Now, if we could show something and I would have, you know, Joe used to make videos like this, there are definitely people who can make these videos that we could outsource it to, basically show them two or three different scenarios where, you know, this is your business, this is your traffic, and these are your steps on the dashboard and this is what business A has, what business B has, what business T has. And this is what they did, and then you watch them, watch the numbers change. And then you can tell the story where a business A had no idea, like these numbers are changing, but business A doesn't have a dashboard, doesn't track it, has no idea what's happening. so makes a decision by guessing, and it's the wrong decision because they didn't know why the numbers were, why they, you know, what they were, whereas let's say business B, same exact person has all the data, or maybe business B has half the data, right, makes a decision, same thing, doesn't go right because they're wrong about where the data, because they only have half the data, it's not accurate. And business C is like, oh, I can see everything, here's the problem, let's go fix it. And we've done X amount of split test because we've been tracking this. And so we know that we'll have
00:40:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you know better impact changing the headline or the image or the call to action or whatever but basically creating a video showing it could be like one video or multiple videos could be case studies but another could be like i'm talking about going after 10 million 20 million 30 40 50 million dollar businesses and charging a premium price premium um yeah i think that yeah i'm starting to think like so funny because a perfect example of that right there is Dave Asbury right so Jenny is doing all the Dave Asbury stuff now running his stuff and their setup is so clued it's not even funny what is that word oh messed up flute means messed up yeah so yeah so it's it's all Stop it. It just doesn't make sense and it's because it it's like it's the classic like you went It was it's just all inherited And so they just keep adding on right to Christmas tree and on to the Charlie Brown tree they inherited when it's like oh boy So the day she's like we're moving everything to Shopify. They sell like single products like that is not what Shopify is for Shopify is not made for that and then it's like They're they're not they don't have all the right data like even though Jimmy's very day-to-driven They don't have all the right data. I'm like dude. You should be on WooCommerce like WooCommerce and funnel kid because there's no limit That's my argument. That's the argument that I made to Frank the WordPress bill, but he's like give me the back story Tell me what you're trying to build and I told me he's like oh, Yeah, he's like you sound like you know what you're doing like you sound like you really he's like you So I'm like, you know, a lot about business. He's like, I know a lot about teaching stuff. He's like, I suck at business. Maybe you could help me better at business. like, yeah, maybe. But it's like, I think that the path is like, you go through Joe, right? So it becomes a tool for Joe to make Joe's coaching business easier. And then it's like, who's another Joe? Maria. Maria wants to go build all these customer automatic customer things.
00:42:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could build an automatic customer starter site. Automatic clients, Alan.
00:42:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, automatic client. I could build an automatic client starter site that's just in the can. You launch it and reskin it for your next client. So then she's she'll get all the she wants and then some, right? then it's like, oh, who else is that? could go to like Greg Merley's and be like, hey, you should just be sending your clients to me because we can build because it's your designs are great, supposedly. don't know if they are, but he does good work. This platform is great. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if they really perform that well, but you can find out really quick by putting on a platform that gives you that data. So then it's like you having these other people sell it for you in the beginning. And I think to your point, it will eventually bubble up, right? So you could go like into Allen's group or go to Allen and be like, Hey, I'm doing this. But it's like, it's like, it's like, it's not open to the public really, right? It's like, we're, I don't want to deal with people. Like, I want to give a good service and good product to good people, right? Cool people, cool things, cool people. I'm not, I'm not trying to run around and get 10,000 clients because I just don't want to deal with that. But if I can get like, 10,000 clients, like, yeah, exactly. And then some people are going to, have are going to be a lot, they're going to need the funnels and the bop-a-bop, they're going to need the whole thing. And then it's like, yeah, then maybe you could append coaching or, and at that point, if you're not even coaching, you're just, it is, because you're like, you should be collecting this data, right? But you need to get, you need to expand what you're doing in analytics, because right, what you get is just the basic. But you want dashboards like this. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, that's, it's, it's a one time fee of $4,000. And we set the whole thing up for you. And then it's tracking all that stuff. And here's how you read it. And then that's it.
00:44:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, I'm set up of like 10,000, like it's just, whatever, yeah, whatever it is. mean, don't even know how to price it, because I don't even know what it is yet. And like, I would not be looking in the, I am world. I'd be looking at doctors and lawyers, like, where are they congregating?
00:45:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But it's not that I am world is on saying no, no, I know, but the other day I was thinking like, I mean, it could be it could be like these coaches in the world are not the lame ones, like the ones that have real businesses, like not the one that I left, I mean, I don't have a room business. I left a hilarious comment on someone's ad today. Some woman's like, I just can't stand these people. She's like, if you want to get my $50 million a year business . If you were making $50 million a year, you would not be running Facebook ads about your coaching business. Ma'am, give me a break.
00:45:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you look like?
00:45:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You look like a bottle blonde that is using 20 year old photos on your website, like a miss. You're not the same person. I can't remember her name. It's, I've never seen her before. And I saw like two of her ads today and then I just left a comment on her. was like, I can't help myself. But, but it was like the click funnels awards, the lame, the stupid, um, sign with the slogan, I'm like, really? I'm like, this is like a textbook. I am scammer. Like, where's the Lambo? What are you doing? Yeah, never, never be gone.
00:46:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
email version of it is it repulses me personally because, because I see behind it, because I know what game they played.
00:46:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Um, anyway, I'm just so never them. It would be never that, right? like, it's not for you. So, and that would be very easy to figure out. You just go look at their website like, yeah, no, this isn't for you or you're not for being one way or the other. Um, but it's like those, those automatic customer funnels, like they can go either way, they can either be scammy or not. Um, yeah, it's like you get to. you get to decide. That's the whole thing. mean, they can't just buy it. It's not a do-it-yourself thing. It's never going to be. But I was thinking like two days ago, was like, man, really, what are you replacing? Like, you're replacing Upwork, you're replacing way more than just WordPress and Kajabi. It's really not on par with those. It's on a whole other level.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Therefore, it should be priced on another level. But it's more than that. It's not about what are you replacing it because if you go with that logic, then they're going to try to do that math. And that is not really what the math is. It's like you've been walking around legally blind and somebody finally gave you glasses that are your prescription. And now you can see everything clearly and sharply. didn't have the glasses before. So you're not replacing something.
00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
getting something life changing that literally changes the way you see the world it's going to stop you from tripping on everything and you know like it's just the correlation is different it's more i mean i was thinking more like it's the benefit argument right what are the benefits the benefits are what you're saying you're going get this better knowledge into your metric you're going to get a better faster sigh you're going to have to you'll never have you don't have deal with outside devs ever or deal like that's gone right so you're getting time back you're getting you're getting all this up oh what are all the benefits now you could throw away the comparative idea like oh it's it benefits like this over kajabi rather than replace kajabi you'd say hey you don't have to deal with outside developers and outside designers like all that goes away you're going to save time and energy there whatever bye
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
stop believing money because they're making stupid decisions because they're uninformed.
00:49:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Then you can start to make start to know your business on like a whole other level when then that I think that's key, right? It was like when I was on the forum with Jamie and Heather the other day and like Jamie's like, okay, gonna make these videos. No, she's talking about Instagram getting Instagram leads. I'm like, well, like Instagram leads have never really been proven to work, right? So if you go do a source report, which, you know, we can sort of do one of those. The data is somewhat there. And I, again, I would argue my data is better than everyone else's because I'm getting them forced when they become a lead. Now, could they have gone to YouTube before that or whatever? Yeah, maybe whatever. But when they entered, I keep calling this like first contact and what last contact people call first touch. Like, yeah, maybe their touch came through YouTube, but we can't, you can't trace touch. I can trace contact, right? can trace that hey, they entered our world One of contacts the right word still, but it's like they became lead and they came from this source It's far but I'm concerned. That's the source Right and then engagement instead of touch or contact Yeah, it's gonna be something else. It's like you can't use it's got to be a new word It's like yeah, like I can't use a word that's already used right so engagement's already used touch is used Contact is going to use Something I haven't read it through we'll read it through chat you can table immediately, but it's really good at that So it will be able to help you come up the word if you define what it looks like so it's not touch Like what does that look like to you and and what makes it not one thing but something else Well, I mean you could say well and I want to use the same word for the beginning and the end Right, so it's like your last so when they purchase it's that's the last version of the first version is a lead The last version is they purchased right so it's like Not interaction like it's some other word, but anyway, so when I was talking to her about it It was like I'm saying I'm gonna get an Instagram do more. I go well. Okay, you get more leads on Instagram. So what? So what you got more leads on Instagram, right? I'm like more leads is not gonna solve the problem. The problem is that you don't right She's making the cloud. go this is the classic blender get more leads like that's not the answer And she's like let me see if I get this street So you're saying if we go get more leads, we're not gonna make more money I'm like, that's exactly what I'm saying and she couldn't put it together And I go but if you I go that's not entirely true if you go get more YouTube leads They will convert therefore you will make more money. the question really is how do you get more YouTube leads? That's the question to me to answer because that's where your money comes from and she doesn't have an answer for that. So I'm like, if you don't have an answer for it, then I mean, it's not all that you can do. But if I can right now go spend $10,000 on Google Ads, I'll get a lot of leads and I won't get $10,000 back.
00:52:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you ever done YouTube ads?
00:52:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, we ran some YouTube ads, but like, it's you can't track them, right? You can't track like the Tom Breeze ones, so you run the ad goes to the channel so you don't get attribution back to YouTube or the ad. So you could look to see like, hey, when I was running these ads, and this is like, it's hard, it's very hard to do because you can't necessarily say, hey, when the period of time I was running these ads did leads go up. So you could do that and say yes or no, but then you have to dig deeper and go. Did all the videos have the same average views as the other period or did she put up a banner video or did this video from whatever so you'd have to look at these Intermatrix of like Did the referring video like which? Did the leads coming in go up? Where did they come from which video to go up and then does that make sense right? Does it make sense that this the video that usually drives leads went up? Therefore my running ads sort of juiced that That would probably be the way to do it I'm thinking I actually do that. I just never did it.

No, I'm not going to because they don't have any money run as Well, I'm pretty sure that was like one of the first goals Or things I said when we were talking about you doing level activity, part of when we do your effective hourly rate, years ago, was saying that whether you hired and trained or just hired somebody who could do ads well for you, that especially if it was somebody where you could say, okay, this is what we should be trying, like, so you're the strategist, at least or consult on it, but somebody that is good at doing it, but you know, did add like you and did the containers the way that you did, but how it keeps changing, the hiring pool keeps changing, so the thing about what I just said is like, I'm the only one that can do that, like not me personally, but like me Dan Ryan basis because nobody tracks the leads from their videos with the that I built.
00:55:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of that, right? It's because I have that data. Now, in the Mercer world, that data would be in a dashboard and you'd be able to look at that at the drop of the hat. Yeah. I hadn't considered.
00:55:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Which would change everything that you do in terms of add the lead generation, which is a huge part of your world and your puzzles at the very least, even if it's not necessarily part of basis, which could be. But anyway, yeah.
00:55:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, because that's like another avatar is like the Jamie, right? It's like going after the YouTubers and just saying, Hey, I've got a I've got this thing that's good for YouTubers. You should be on this because you get all this stuff. But I think part of the like Jamie is that they're like, I follow this to Rick Biano. who's got this massive YouTube channel and he's like this super music nerd he does great interviews but that MFR is running like a sale every other week and I'm like dude please stop stop running sales like you're losing money who's ever guiding you is guiding you incorrectly every week it's some stupid sale like you're devaluing yourself this is not a good thing but they're probably at the end of the week going oh look we got $10,000 in sales like oh geez no don't do that but he's like a he's a perfect YouTube and I can tell you right now he has no idea which videos drive business because nobody's ever nobody's ever done it on braces like I had never seen somebody do this yeah but I think will be interesting now a year from now because of AI like
00:57:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Google's integrated AI into search results, Google on YouTube, YouTube definitely has the AI, like what, whether or not it's available at a free level, which I don't imagine they'd want to, but I feel like, we don't know, that better analytics for this stuff is not too far away unless they want you to stay operating blind so that you keep guessing, so that you basically are gambling.
00:57:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And that was the upshot of that video that I mentioned a couple weeks ago where the guy turned off all the black box stuff and got better results. he was like, the less I told them, the better I did. But that's because, you know, they just want us to take your money.
00:57:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we're
00:58:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
right and that's why this stuff like I mean the thing that I don't know that someone brought up to they were like oh well you know stafari strips strips the utms I think that is true but I'm like I don't have that problem if just switch them all to PGT they are utms and then now I can't I can't tell google analytics that they're utms but I can get that data in google analytics as like an alternative utm right as these events better and then prime build dashboards based on those as if they were utms they are they act just like them they just literally are not them I was like that's something else other people can't do you
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
last week on. The summer pace is always a little slower and slower. The strolls to work. I got my dog and he made me my mom. can't wait for the kids to finish the Is it what are they doing building it? Well, it's a came, you know, all the parts. So they didn't have to like engineer it and blueprint and design it. But it's it's been, you know, top to bottom, start to finish building it. Oh, and almost done. What was I looking at? on. Sorry. I lost my notes when I lost my. mouse. I mean, that's all the stuff that we're working on really. OK, and hopefully you don't have to run anywhere. Just ask some quick questions about just whatever else has been happening. Rapid fire, rapid fire, rapid fire. Well, touching any of the projects, just just anything that stands out as a problem, an epiphany, an aha, since we talked last.
01:01:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
very near higher Frank. Frank is definitely next level. So I think that's all gonna get done well and good. Norio finished. Perfect wedding timeline. And he released it to Abishik for software testing. So they're going back and forth right now. So Norio's like go find the thing. So he's like, all right, now we're in stage two. Bugs washing. So we'll get him to try and find some stuff. Then we'll let some people on it, let them start using it. And then it'll be like, then we can release it for like public consumption. Which my plan there now is, this is so weird like, so Jamie's tagline is lovely humans. So like over a year ago, that domain was for sale and I bought it. never told anyone.
01:02:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one.
01:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I started to figure the other day, like, I need them to give me this domain, like the whole point of me telling them to come up with a brand name so that I could be brand.
01:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need them to give you what domain?
01:02:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
To take that. need to do ownership domain, and we'll keep using that name. But the domain needs to be my name now. And I was like, she's never going to do that. And then I thought, Oh, wait, I'm going to trade her domains. I'll give you lovely, lovely humans and you're going to give me perfect wedding time line. And she 1000% will do that. And I paid like 900 bucks for the domain or something. So I like, I got to do that. So then we can roll that out. And then I think, I'm just going to tell Heather and Jamie, but just tell the dude, Hey, just working with another vendor. That's it. Like, you don't owe the guy an explanation. Just say, yeah, we're working with another vendor that we can. That's it.
01:03:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What guy?
01:03:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the timeline genius, the guy that's getting- Oh. They're doing like a 50-50 rev split, but like he actually makes more money because we have to pay someone to do all the customer service. So he actually makes more money. So, but I think I'm going to, I mean, kind of want to tell them like we have to change the split, maybe, or I haven't really figured it out yet. So anyway, so that's going to, so now Norio's available. And then I hit him up yesterday, I go, okay, great, can you start working on this fan flowy stuff? And he's like, absolutely. So I had a couple of tasks there for Saad, he wasn't responding, and then all of a sudden today, he's like, done done. So we'll see if those are done that we can finish this Spotify integration, but then I'm going to unleash Norio on like the two or three apps. We want there, which he should probably be like, dude, this is simple. I go, well, the other is even simpler. One might not be. I'm going to hold that one for the last. going to get some clarification on how to build this. We need to build some sort of API into GoDaddy that will allow people to make sub-domains on fan flow. I know it's possible. just not sure. It's actually the right move. But anyway, Noreo can start working on that stuff.
01:04:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to hit up Mark and then take that lead. Because you can make sub-domains on high level also, can't you? It doesn't have to be done at the registrar.
01:04:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It does with all this new email . You got to append all those extra records. But yeah, so yes and no. You're going to want it to be custom. They'll get to pick the sub-domains. but we're going to be like it should be your band name teama gang dot fan flowy dot com so that won't probably be last because i think it's the most complicated but i'm going to actually ask i level like hey how would i do this uh and then i'm going to go back to shot and mark and then they've got so many bands on this now so we need to like take a step back and like clean up some stuff but like the core stuff is built it works it people are getting results right now i'm like we just need to clean up some stuff and then go this you know version one was waiting for the Spotify thing stamp it as version one but like okay and then i'm like you guys need to charge everyone that's on there right now a subscription like you should not be selling this as and and um and included it should be hey start your subscription and then we're going to charge you to run your ads above the clock because you're your bypass the whole primary model of it being a recurring subscription based business, right? You're you're including the software for free. That's a mistake. Like, now, if you want to, like, give these guys like, uh, founders price that we never take away, fine. I'm totally okay with that. Let's do that. But they need to, they need to be running subscriptions and then because then they can tell people, oh, I have a subscription, but you might not be able to get the price that I get.
01:06:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then I was like, okay, value of the software and service.
01:06:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. So then I was like, all right, we're going to do that and they'll do it. And then it was like, then I started thinking similar line to your, like, I told Darryl about it and Darryl was like, what? are you building?
01:06:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I told him, I was like, I have to, I'm sorry. Every time I think this, did you ever watch Darryl? Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry Larry my brother Dale Every time you see Daryl every time. I'm all the brother.
01:07:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No Okay, I told Daryl and I was like, oh man, I just got to figure out the math of this So once we have like whatever the price is I was like we should do an affiliate thing with Darryl's Daryl's in the studio with a band every week Every week. I'm like if we made him an affiliate and we paid him a percentage of the script subscription for a fixed period of time Right. Hey, you get x percent for the first Six months or if they stick three months you get x percent and it's equal to Why So for every band you get on you're going to make 200 bucks or whatever it is he'll refer it out all day long. And I'm like, how many other darels are there? Or maybe you do pay them in perpetuity, like high level. If I came in as long as I stay on, then he's even more motivated to do it.
01:08:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes. But it could be like, there's a higher front end costs or whatever reward. No, because you don't want to tend to bring people. So tear it up. So once you bring us, you know, 20 people, and it has to be how many people are currently subscribers. So let's say if you get up to 50 subscribers, so up to 50 subscribers, it's like 4%. 50 subscribers active and above, it's 5%, whatever. numbers mean nothing. point is that you unlock the levels by how many existing subscribers you get. Yeah. So that they are incentivized to bring people that stay because then he doesn't have to keep replacing them just like, you know, any other business, you're better off having to go chase down new customers. And, and then he unlocks higher levels. And like, why would you not want to pay somebody? there's a marketing budget anyway.
01:09:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's just basically the marketing budget, they go get you customers. And he'll get bulls-eye customers, right? And then it's like, okay, and then if you only have a handful of them and those guys know people, right? So it's like, yeah, if we just open this up to a handful of people, like, it's not come one, come all sign up for our affiliate program. No, no, it's like, taste maker affiliate program. And if you get like 12 or 20 people that are dialed in, they'll do it. Especially, I mean, because it's going to be, it is going to progress. So that stuff's all going, and then it's just like with another 71, it's like steady eddy. We're still climbing towards the 490, which I think I figured it out the other day, sometime in September.
01:10:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:10:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Here's September. Yeah. Yeah. We should hit that, and then I got some other, like the dent repair guys, those are the dudes I was talking about earlier that have all the leads, like they want, they want to build, it is interesting. like, do you think you could build a PDR as the name of the industry, or do you think you could build a PDR version of high level that could, we could sell the PDR industry?
01:10:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
go, yeah. Yeah. What's PDR?
01:10:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
A painless dent repair. Oh. So like their, their business is a show and, but they're making money hand over fist, and I'm like, but you're probably losing money hand over That's sort of that that's sort of that the hidden the hidden thing, right? It's like By not knowing all your numbers. You're you're losing money You just can't you just can't see it. Yeah, yep, sort of like mark like mark on Monday. Like he's coming It's coming around to what the real problem is mark. You pay people too much hate to break it to you He's known so last year No, I know but now it's becoming like Painful. Yeah, yep, and painful is when the change comes and and the reason he did it Was to be a nice guy Right, he didn't he didn't do it because oh it wasn't for retention. It wasn't for whatever It was for Whatever it was to feel a good number room I think that's part of it, but I think part of it was retention because he was if you remember Really concerned about losing people, especially samantha I But I just don't know if his concerns real, and I think that I think that's also happened. No, I don't think it is, but I think it was to him for a long time. Yeah, yeah. definitely.
01:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He the theft. Yeah, that like, and how long it takes to replace people and the comfort like people weren't as happy.
01:12:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh my God, the revelation was wait, these people don't need to be lawyers. I was floored when he said that. I'm like, whoa, And he's like, yeah, no, they don't need to be lawyers. So I'm like, oh, well, that totally changes things, right? Because you cannot, he cannot tell me, and especially if you talk to Salko, Salko's like, dude, this isn't that hard. He's like, these guys, they're not lawyers. Like Sam and Tyler, and they're not lawyers. They are not. He's like, they are people with law licenses. There's a huge difference. mean, he would argue that. Mark is not a lawyer. He's like mark has never set foot in the courtroom ever and he never will so it's like ever Yeah, most of them won't most of them never will because I know that's right doesn't want to that's why he likes this I mean, that's the track that they're on right so in a way they're completely overpaid and now even more so I'm like Dude, they're really overpaid and you know, I just keep saying it But it's like I know the time's not right, but I know the time is also rapidly approaching If you start to dial in these processes, which is happening with intake, which is where it should start You start dialing in these processes You're he's gonna discover. Oh, yeah, I don't need lawyers Like you could because it's all It's there's no if you're never going into the courtroom Right if you're never going in and trying to woo a jury and get a higher verdict And you're just dealing with the black and white. It's either there or it's not Right so you can't make an argument to get this huge settlement when the policy doesn't go that high. So there are these built limitations, but the processes don't exist, right? like in Salko's point, that's why the whole AI conversation I had with Salko when I was like, oh, no, no, you could teach it to look for words. And he was like, oh, wait, what, really? Yeah, yeah, totally.
01:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But, okay, so, and this is why I take a holistic approach to business is because the CEO is always a bottle that one way or another. all are, because we're But one of Mark's issues. I know I am. Same. Is that he needed Bonparone, but now he's making friends.
01:14:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes, exactly. All kinds of things happening.
01:14:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, yes, yes. So his need for that is changing. And in, I, I didn't put the two together before, but you know, yeah, anyway, that's what happens when people and it's like, you're looking at the map on the page and I mean, he knew it.
01:15:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I wasn't even really sure, but it came out of his mouth. He's like, oh, it's way too high. I'm like, yeah, probably is.
01:15:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what?
01:15:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
When he was talking about payroll, he's like, my overhead is way too high. And then we, and then he drilled it further and said the overhead is payroll.
01:15:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, a bunch of people wrote it. Okay.
01:15:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's the other interesting thing. I don't think he had thought about it. It didn't seem like it to me, but I'm like, dude, if you're just growing and you're not making more money, what are you doing? And he thought it was to sell the firm and I'm like, but is that, is that what the multiple is based on? And he's like, no, not really, right? It's like, oh, it's the cases. That's the thing. I think he's starting to see that. I mean, he's done it. He's on pace to do almost a hundred this month into the math yesterday. I think it's in 94 Not counting whatever closed yesterday. I sorted I could be slightly off. So he's on pace to do a hundred in July where there's a holiday in the summer Right three things three things that are against that happen with his best lead source Monday getting the bed Totally just doing horrible and it's like get here you are and You know what? not hearing I'm overwhelmed. I can't we need more pods like it's not a trip That is not true. That's the next thing bringing it that up Monday Yeah Bring that up Monday And if anyone's gonna complain about being overwhelmed, it would be in California in the summer Cuz they're like I'm missing out going it's not like something like dude every time I talk to Tyler, he's at the airport, going somewhere, like I believe in me.
01:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so the last thing that I wanted to say, well, two parts, I don't know, my brain is like shutting down now, but that even our thoughts are iterative, you know, like, because we are changing, having new thoughts constantly, like it gets frustrating because like something will be obvious to you, something will be obvious to me, but that's, we're thinking based on our lenses, based on our experience, but also based on our makeup, being, for example, you're happily married with two kids, and like, home life matters, and our ability to make certain types of decisions is affected and affected and infected by the rest of our circumstances and so changing those things, changing his morning routine, him changing friendships, changing all these different things, makes him able to make decisions he couldn't have made before because Mark as a person, as an emotional creature, which we all are, as EOR, needed to make alterations, but those changes don't happen like that. They don't happen overnight. They don't happen because we had a conversation last week and you immediately apply it and change it and then you get the impact and effect and but it's it's all gradual. It's all a gradient spectrum type of changes, results of changes. Now we have new insight. Now we have new lenses. Now we see things differently. we know more things. things. Now we've altered our environment and the gist. That's why it's so complicated. That's why pacing matters so much. I know, you know, like I'm not preaching to you, but it's just every week, I think about, you know, what we could have done and what we already knew, but you can't take the person out of the equation. But, and that's also why, if you're going to launch basis, your first few people, 100% because that interaction is probably going to be more weighty than maybe down the road when you streamline everything. Those should be the most cherry-picked kind of clients, partners, whatever that you bring on, because that will affect the trajectory, I guess, of how basis evolves. because no matter how much we want to think of it as a system, a process, a product, whatever, you're at the center of it and whoever you're interacting with regularly is at the center of it and that energy makes a huge impact on the decisions that get made so the path that gets plotted out and so on. Yeah, anyway, just pondering, I guess. And my brain is going, I need food and probably nap. Well, I get a massage in two hours. My Russian massage Elena, she's so good. She's like scary also because she's Russian, but also she's like a second mama and loving and it's awesome. It's a 90 minute massage and I'm gonna go nap after that.
01:20:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, or during.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, she talks too much.
01:20:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She always wants that. I pass out sometimes it's hilarious.
01:21:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I just thought that honestly I might just go in and be like I'm in a nap Lina right Okay, you I glad that you walked to the office keep taking care of yourself and I Dan You

Say hi. Oh, you're just going to snuggle.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi. She needs a haircut badly. Um. Get the email you sent me.
00:01:04 - Chona Sweet
I didn't do one assignment. Did I just give you my stats for?
00:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
see. Let me get this into it.
00:01:25 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's too big. A spreadsheet and then the giant text. I did it through the notes app. It's bold.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's see. homework. It might be colder than I realized it was out here, but I really just needed to be out of the house for a while. Let's see. that's Fuji. There we go. Oh yeah, so you're already using dragon dictation, right?
00:02:09 - Chona Sweet
No, so what happened was he bought a dragon device, but it's not compatible with my apple and he bought apparently he bought me a laptop, but I don't he's all over the place. The one that has I don't have it, so I'm still using my Mac, so which and if I told you this I have arthritis and I can feel it now.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I'm a witch.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
You did not tell me that, but I have osteoarthritis and yeah, I have I have psoriatic arthritis, so mine is a different kind of different, but it's you know it's it's more of like a you know skin, I have two in one psoriasis and I That's fun. Yeah, that's lots of fun.
00:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, did Mark decide if he's coming or not?
00:03:06 - Chona Sweet
I don't think so. He's slammed. He's like so short when he responded. he wanna, I'll let you leave.
00:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You tell me what you want. So let's go back over the homework quick.
00:03:20 - Chona Sweet
So map out, ideal, work read. Okay. So I can also copy his comments into my notes, which I was actually, yeah, when you're done. No, I was thinking about it and I don't know why it's having difficulty answering that question. I don't know why. I feel like because your question is now and the future. Yeah, I don't know why it, I'm having difficulty answering that. question. That's, that's something to look into.
00:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me just work through it.
00:04:13 - Chona Sweet
Talk, talk to me about it. So I think right now, I mean, maybe because of the, um, uncertainty of all of these, like, I honestly do not know how I, I assume that I will have to work a lot. That's what's in my head. That's why it's hard for me to even schedule something for, to work on my physical health and maybe, you know, schedule a workout.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel that's actually the reason for the exercise. So we reverse engineer it is what we do. Now there are going to be seasons where you're definitely Going to be putting in a lot more time. You're in one of those seasons right now starting as always the hardest part right, but there is There's not really any such thing as work-life balance right where everything's always everything is good all the time That doesn't work but it's more like Changing harmony like if you ever seeing and you're seeing in music the notes are changing constantly and Sometimes they're in harmony with each other. Sometimes there's dissonance and all of it's beautiful and and it's orchestrated on purpose, so What what we want to do is figure out So this is a conversation about principles and priorities and values right and from that so Principles and priorities inform What we're going to do and why we're going to do it and well okay so principles inform priority right what's important to us our values inform what's important to us what's important to us is priority right and priority informs activity what are we going to do it should it doesn't always most times people are on autopilot or they're doing they're reactive and they're doing what they're told to do or what they think they ought to do rather than what is actually most important to them so by having this conversation early on we get to the point sooner rather than later where you can do the things that you need to do because whatever you do if you're burning yourself out it's not maintainable right hey Mark sorry I just caught the last part about trying to burn yourself out on purpose now yeah tell me something I don't know mr. sweet let's go faster let's go Oh, master. Oh, my gosh. Tona, do you know how many times if I could have, like, reached through the... Yeah, who many times?
00:07:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm really basis for her as well with me, so I have to I'm telling me shocked.
00:07:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, we can shift gears, Tona. We can go back to that because I'd rather use Mark's brain for two things. So what you brought up is just...
00:07:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm suddenly you drugged up at the moment, so just as an FYI.
00:07:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fun? Oh, how's Ronan?
00:07:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He has a cough, he's adorable.
00:07:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:07:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)

00:07:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. My little girl went to school for the first time in a week. They've got COVID. It's been going around yesterday. I almost want to cry just thinking about it, but I got her up, and I'm like, are you going to go to school? She goes like... I need to like yeah, you do and so I go out and she gets dressed and she's to the door and she's got her backpack on She's being a good girl, I look at her and she got tears down her eyes, and I'm like going back to bed You were not going to school Okay, I feel better now. Okay, wait, no actually she thinks that's distracting me I was trying to pay attention to what you wanted. Okay, so When you're talking about she has a first shot at first one shot at first impression. Yes What is good ice? Oh, look how cute.
00:08:30 - Chona Sweet
Shona is China you so I'm telling he's You're cute.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're adorable.
00:08:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're beautiful Cool sandwich place in New York City Tell it's based in Tuscany, I guess like all on Tonshio sandwiches So they make the bread fresh every five minutes and so it's really thin You guys get all this good food.
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I live in redneckville, okay, and they're And when I get to go visit my sweetheart, I'm like this Let's have like just feed me. I'm I'm happy. Okay. So, okay, so the automation and follow up. Sorry, is a conversation we were having. But the fact that you brought up first impressions, make me wonder if there's an issue that's happening. Okay, so let's talk about that.
00:09:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, because we can never time things perfectly, because you know, like, there was a patient that came to see Chona that was involved in a car collision. And it's not like a big enough case that I would get super excited about. mean, I would probably take it all things considered. So this was a really good way to for her to introduce herself to some other law firms, right, one of which ways to introduce yourself to a law firm. Hey, I have a potential case for you. And depending on how she had the relationship start, depends on how you would approach that, right? Yeah. And so the initial reaction was she had a law firm try to send them a case at one point and pull the case from Chris and Frank. And so I was like, okay, we'll meet that. the good one, but they weren't very responsive. So, I connected Chona to Mike Hobbes, who's a firm that I personally work with a lot. I like the guys a lot. very, very straightforward, but they're a very high volume firm. So their model is they get a lot of referrals from other attorneys and they also do a lot of their own marketing. This is not as we confuse with the Hobbes up north that Dan's worked with before, just FYI in case that comes up at all. They do about 300 cases a month. So, they do a pretty significant amount in just California. Okay. So, they're a high volume firms, but they're good guys, right? wouldn't connect to Chona if you didn't think we're good people. So, I don't know how the conversation went, I just said, hey, I'm introducing you, I called Mike, I told them about Chona about the practice that's going on, and one of the things that Mike said is, look, we're getting pushed back really, really heavily about doctors in our cases. So the doctors making a huge value difference on the personal injury side, which is something that I've you've heard me preach about, you know, 10,000 times. That's why the doctors are so important. So I go and spend time with them. That's why we keep trying to find new doctors because the personal injury course gets to be known as, you know, people who just do the same things again and again and become very well known and the insurance companies devalue them very heavily.
00:11:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you watching the football game?
00:11:27 - Chona Sweet
That's, I don't know how you can see the background on the school.
00:11:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What, that was sorry.
00:11:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's muted.
00:11:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's squirrel squirrel. Okay.
00:11:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, I thought it's wrong. And so that's one of things that I love with what Chona works with with Dr. E because he does so much insurance work. He barely does any personal injury in comparison. And so he's a very like clean doctor. And so even if gets to pose or whatever else, he can honestly say the vast majority of my work is insurance. This is what I built all this is when I do this is why it works. And it's great. And so for a firm like Mike Hobbuses, they're really excited because, hey, this is a new clean doctor that's like a secret weapon to someone. So now we've got three factors coming together. And I do this to kind of lay the groundwork, right? yeah, she was reaching out to them with, Hey, I've got this new client for you. So awesome. This doctor's already sending me clients. I told Mike, you know, I don't really want you on a sending me clients and not really want to send them clients because I think it could theoretically be a conflict, even though it's not. But just to not be conflicting.
00:12:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Avoid the appearance.
00:12:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Avoid the appearance of it. Reality and appearance are obviously two different things. But you know, these are people I trust and they're like, okay, that makes sense of why he's marketing me something really great if he doesn't have any interest, right? And it makes sense of why I'm doing it because I can't do it really for myself. Right. So here's Chona's introduction this afternoon to Mike Hobbuses, who could drive them, you know, 15 to a. hundred patients a month.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, huge.
00:13:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They're not ready for 50 to 100 patients a month, unfortunately, of new PI with how they're set up. But I can always pick and choose the timing of these things, right?
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, you can not do it preemptively, like too soon. You can do that.
00:13:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
an option for past that option.
00:13:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that we are fully accountable across the board.
00:13:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
The other part of it, too, is I know Dr. E's, I mean, he's patient, but there's some lack of patients as well. Like, you know, been 45 days now and he probably would want to see some movement on the personal injury side.
00:13:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're faster, Mark.
00:13:42 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What does that sound like? Yeah, I know. Constantly faster. But also, this gives Chona a reason to say, hey, we need these things in place rather than just home.
00:13:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, sorry. dias are starting to hurt. Okay, focus, focus, focus.
00:14:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Her, I also saw this as a way for Chona to leverage this fact of, hey, I've got this new attorney's office who produces a lot of cases that's going to start sending us stuff that we need to get our together for lack of a better term, because Dr. E said the right things during our lunch of, hey, we'll make sure we have the proper email and proper things, but I kind of know how these guys go and like they'll say the right thing, but they get so distracted by shiny objects and, you know, else that's going on, and just quite frankly, his work period, that it's not top priority until it needs to be a higher priority. And so this is a way to push it to be a higher priority. Okay. That being said, in the short-term interim, so you were trying to push Dr.
00:14:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E into making your work that you're doing a higher priority. I just want to make sure I'm on understanding this clearly.
00:14:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay, cool. And sorry, Chona's value and everything else. So that way, Dr. E gets a little more excited about building up the structure he needs to build out. Realize it's actually right there. Correct. And it's happening and not just theoretical and not . Yeah, got you. Um, so that's the reason for it. And I know that if something does go wrong on the first one or two, like these are guys I know well enough I can give them give Chona another chance in a couple months, but I obviously would prefer not to do that. So so when you talk about first impressions, you're more about like the whole operation, not like I'm talking about, unfortunately, you know, Chona's been told, okay, we've got this like info ad, you know, pain management or whatever it's called. We've got cast. We've got everything else like you telling Chona like, just do it yourself until you have a system that works because when you rely on other people, it's not their priority. It's a higher chance of it going wrong. And so it's building a temporary system until she can build a better system and a better thing around it.
00:15:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm with you, except you need to understand where she's at. She is in the oldest profession. That's not the oldest profession. Okay.
00:16:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Okay.
00:16:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:16:05 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That is definitely not the oldest profession. Why not? she's in that.
00:16:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's a whole other thing we're going to talk about. Okay. One of the oldest professions ever. That is predominantly male. And this is, this is the reality though. There is an energy and a stigma and a literal psychological term. Ask Jonah that shows up and I'm trying to explain this in the way that you could understand because I know you and I know you're like whatever just do it. That kind of thing. But it's not that it's actually it's really not that easy. Of course it needs to be how I do things. Okay, but so there's there's two things that you have to deal with. Number one is the the actual issue of the structure and the mentality that she has to massage and work around. But the first step is China has to feel confident enough to do that. And that is being built up right now. That is new. So you remember how I talked about saying sweet things, Mark, and being encouraging. This is going to be one of those things where you actually have the most power to do that and just encourage her, again, a particular way. Because I can tell you as a woman who's come up, you know, six years in corporate and then in this business, there even when you're a very, very strong woman and born that way, there's, there's a lot that you have to fight mentally because you're kind of groomed to feel energy and then pull back when, when you resistance and kind of be like, okay, well, work around it, whatever. So the best way, and I'm telling both of you, the strategy to go around this is similar to the tactic that you just pulled, which is let me show you what's really on the table. So, and Chona, one of my favorite things that I learned is that it's better to make forgiveness than ask permission and just kind of do things. But, Mark, the stress and the energy that, so let's say she goes and she does everything perfectly. It's still going to stress the crap out of her. And she's going to take that energy and anxiety and it's going to need to have an outlet. You understand this? You've gone through so many things since we've been working together.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know. She's in control of it and it's not up to someone else to drop the ball. For sure.
00:18:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona, who's being quiet right now and can participate in this conversation, you can do all of these things. But you guys will all get there faster. Just understanding the real, like, so you're not answering your phone first thing in the morning and checking the email and being reactive to everything that happened. She's barking at the dare. They play tag. Literally, they will just chase you. each other and the deer will stay there. And if the dogs go away, it'll stay there until it comes back and then they just wait down. Anyway, have a daddy. What was I saying? Sorry, it's only last during the talk. Dogs, but I really need to be out of time.
00:19:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, if I were in children's shoes, I would use this opportunity to leverage it. To talk to talk to me, to say, hey, I've got this potentially coming in. Let's try to make a system for right now of some of these new patients coming through because the one in our trip, it's like, yeah, I'm going to make these changes. going to set up this email that's proper. going to talk to Cheryl. I don't know if I'm to or did that not happen or you don't know.
00:19:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, so I'm not sure you want me to answer your question for you. want to talk about what we talk about. We have us or, you know, I don't know where you guys will just start right now.
00:19:59 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
we need to know what structure has been
00:20:00 - Chona Sweet
I haven't seen him the whole day. I just saw my patients because he texted me like 20 minutes before 9. He says, oh, you're taking over Long Beach patients today. And so I just get ready and it's 30 minutes away. So that's what happened this morning. But to answer your question, I haven't talked to him. He's gonna call me supposedly tonight. He's in the OR right now doing cases. So that's that. So I don't, I don't know if we have an email. Sorry.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:20:40 - Chona Sweet
Go ahead. You're still talking. Right now, I spoke with one patient that's coming from Mark. Actually, I talked to her last month. So she's kind of all over the place. So finally, she agreed to come tomorrow. So that particular patient is coming from me because. through Mark. So they created a group chat for me, the office manager cast, which is part of, the office manager Cheryl cast, which is part of the lean and then me. So they open a new chat for me and then another person for me to put in there all the patients that's coming from me. Just a, not a formal medical records. It's more like, Hey, I have this new patient. Can you put it on the list tomorrow for me? That's, that's the, that's the only progress so far that I've seen that some sort of kind of segregation, like for me to say, this is for Chona from Chona, you think the chat for her. So that's actually a good thing because I, that's a start because I, I checked them today and I said, Hey, I want this patient to make a release. then the managers, like, we created a chat for you. I said, I'm not included. So and then he's like, okay, let me include you. So that's actually a win already. That's number one and then number two about Mike have us about this new patient that I I'm referring to them right, so I talked to Mike have us and I we talked briefly about the patient about my background Where we're at where offices at and he asked something that I really don't understand he asked something about who manages your lean or your the paper you guys have someone else just doing that so what I understood is he's third-party Person like choice and what I said is no, it's just us managing That's my answer and then he's like, okay, so that's that was a question.
00:22:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Let me explain to you exactly what he was asking They know exactly what he's asking. He's asking about billing Yeah, it's a lot of pain doctors and a lot of busier practices have either third parties or a biller handle it. And it's generally a huge source of frustration because those billers are paid on what percentage of the total bill they get. So they're incentivized to try to get as much from the lowers as possible. And on our side, lower side, it can get really frustrating because it just sometimes doesn't make sense. we'll make a very fair offer. And they try to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks or 200 bucks that just pisses off the attorney and takes acceptance. So yeah, so what you about was you being the main point of contact for billing for scheduling for everything else kind of in the short term. So you have control and how this feels good about it. And God forbid you ever leave Dr. E or go somewhere else. It's tied to you and not to someone else.
00:23:48 - Chona Sweet
So here's where my appreciation of all of this right now with with because I view and I told Mark about this and Mark gets, you know, easily appreciated with me. because I asked a lot of questions and I'm new. I have to reiterate that I'm really new at this field. And I don't know the dem, you know, all the abrogations, like anything like that. And sometimes I think Mark gets frustrated because, you know, Mark wants the things done, but he doesn't want to discuss the steps towards it or even diminution, like little things. I, like when I was asked that question, talking about first impression, I don't know if he got impressed with me or not because I, and he asked me questions about where do you do your MRI. It's a good thing I remember where I've been there for one and a half weeks, one and a half months. I remember this imaging place. I said, the wave imaging, I said, and then he said, that's actually a good place. it's a good thing that I even remember that. But then again, between Mark and Dr. E, I don't feel like I'm getting enough information, like. actually not support me, but it doesn't feel that way, if that, if I'm being honest.
00:25:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a lot to say, let's break all of these things down. First of all, just taking into account that there's a lot for you to wrap your head around. And Mark, so have I ever used the driving analogy and explain that to you what it's like, either one of you? Okay, so do you remember what it was like to learn how to drive? Yes. Learn how to drive.
00:25:29 - Chona Sweet
Actually, I was telling Mark I learned how to drive here in America.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so here's, here's the point of that is that when you learn how to drive, first of all, my girls always think that it's so easy. They're like driving it so easy. I can't wait until I can do it. And then they get behind the wheel and they freak out because it's terrifying because what you have to process mentally, you have to know the law. But the law seems like it just goes out of your brain because now you're faced with, I'm at a forward intersection and I don't know if I go left or right. to drive stick. So I'm also trying to process the clutch and the gas and the break all at the same time while my mom's over here freaking out and I'm feeling her energy. And then I'm like, do I go? Do they go? And there's all of these thoughts and it is overwhelming and frustrating. And every single second in the car is stressful. But then a year later, you know, you've just been doing it. And one day you look around and you're like, this isn't that bad. It's not that stressful. And five years from now, you can eat and drink and have phone calls.
00:26:32 - Chona Sweet
You shouldn't do that. I'm just kidding. Nobody does that.
00:26:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, don't worry. I don't put on makeup or do any of that stuff, but I will eat and have a conversation. Oh my gosh. Anyway, there's the neighbor dogs. So the thing is, in the beginning, and for quite a while, you're mechanically processing everything. But there are gaps in knowledge. So when you're first learning how to drive, if you've never come into They have roundabouts now. They didn't that used to have roundabouts. some of the roundabouts have multiple lanes. And some of them don't. Every day, China is running into something brand new. Every day. And we don't know what we don't know. So sometimes she doesn't even know what questions to ask. But then if she has enough perception to say, I need to ask this question, but there's nobody to answer the question. Or nobody who can answer it from the perspective that she needs it, right? And that's different brains. It's a combination of different brains, and different personalities, as well as different values, which hold on to that word of values, because we need to come back to that with Dr. E. But you have to keep all of that in mind. Chona, this is why I'm telling you, like this is where you just have to buckle down and know it's going to suck for a while for all of these reasons. And you are going to deal with people who don't understand what it feels like for you to do what you do. And that is part of the path and part of the journey is not doing it because of how other people show up because of but because of what you want to come out of it. So if people aren't giving you what you want, then you have to decide, am I going to keep pushing until I get what I want? Am I going to drive this? Or are you going to let Mark drive it? And then you are just passenger and you're just kind of the leaf blowing in the wind. So I would recommend that you take a little bit more charge of it. If doing these things that way but for you to feel confident in it, you're going to have to drive and but taking into account that right now you don't know how to drive. You don't have the tools and you don't have the practice so it's important to keep that perspective and it's going to continue to be frustrating. Now there are things that we can do to speed up that process and smooth it out and one of the things is having a conversation with Dr. E between the two of you, I'd be Happy to join the conversation and help facilitate it, but it's really important to know what are his drivers, what are his motivators, what is his top priority. Because if his top priority is I'm on autopilot, I get through the day, I want more money, but I don't want to really put any effort into it. I don't want to do the structure. I don't want to make any changes. That's not really compatible. So then you got to hold them down and mark this to somewhere where you could be really useful be like, you say one thing, you do another. So like, these are the numbers that are available to you. Now, don't use my language. Use yours. This is me saying this is around the conversation, right? You have to figure it out. Now, did you just sell him into something he wasn't really interested in because you could?
00:29:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
No, no, no, no. Okay. Dr. E is a good doctor. He's a better business person. Okay. And he's been doing some personal injury before all of this. Personally, he's not brand new to him.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if he's a good business person, why is he not understanding how to support this process better?
00:30:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He is drinking out of like four firehouses at the same time.
00:30:13 - Chona Sweet
Like Mark worse than me.
00:30:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's not necessarily a good business person.
00:30:18 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
That's a busy business person. Very busy business person. Like we're talking about how he took over for Optum. Now he has 6,000 plus regular patients he needs to see and not enough staff to build on top of it. He's in the OOR right now. He is a practicing doctor while trying to also manage this business. And again, what he does on the insurance side or is the personal injury side are two almost contradictory practices. And so what I mean by that is he gets paid up at flat fee per month to take care of all these patients. He gets a little bit extra for, you know, each procedure he does. But he is almost incentivized to make it harder or more difficult for these patients. patients to come in, because he gets paid the same amount per month, whether he sees one patient or a hundred patients.
00:31:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That sounds very contradictive to what you're trying to do.
00:31:10 - Chona Sweet
So I don't want to cut Mark because we already established a key busy. I feel like he wanted someone to drive this, but here's my problem. I feel like I'm walking an eggshells, not with him, but with his office manager. So, you know, Cheryl. Cheryl wants to be involved with all of this. I don't know what kind of pay structure he did with her. I feel like he did also something else with PI with her, and he or he wants her to always be involved on the back end because he wants to take control on this PI cases.
00:31:49 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But even another layer to it, he won't let her negotiate on the billing for PI.
00:31:54 - Chona Sweet
He wants to be in control of the money side of it. No, he does. She negotiates the PI too, but she gets frustrated. because the lawyers always, you know, negotiate down, so she doesn't like that, but she, she, I've talked to her multiple times because I wanted to be on her good side too. I wanted to understand how the practice works. She wanted help, but at the same time, I don't know if she's ready to let the rain go, you know. So, because when I asked her, if I have a new client that's coming from me, how does it work? And she once, and she, wants her to be emailed first. And that's what Mark and I are trying to avoid, is steer away from that, create a universal email where I am CC, where it will go to me, go to Cheryl, go to Cass, and go to E. But that's the email that Mark is talking about. Beyond that, it's the politics of me trying, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with Cheryl, today. that I have a new patients for tomorrow, I already make a schedule and then they ask do you want me to call the patient schedule? No, I already did all that. Because again, I wanted to drive this, I wanted to make sure that I'm in charge on making sure there's appointments. again, that's where my frustration is at, other than no structure. But we are overwhelmed with the new patients coming in because of this optimization.
00:33:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And new patients, not PI patients, they're regular.
00:33:28 - Chona Sweet
PI, this is the regular patient of the clinic.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so there's a lot of moving parts in there and personalities and roles. And that's what I was talking about too, having a conversation like understanding what drives and motivates Cheryl. Chona, I don't know that you were there for the conversation, but we were talking about how can she take stuff off of Cheryl's plate or how can she make it better because
00:34:00 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm sure, so like Mary, this is kind of, I don't know possible.
00:34:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cheryl's married. Right. So sometimes it's working around, sometimes it's working with, but first we have to identify what is the situation. I'm probably going to move in a minute.
00:34:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's driving me nuts. Go ahead. More than that. It's making sure Cheryl's still somewhat in the loop, whether we're working around her or not. If she feels like we're actively trying to cut her out. That's when there's going to be the biggest problem.
00:34:26 - Chona Sweet
Which I can talk to her again tomorrow. Every time I go see her, Cheryl talks a lot. I feel like I like her as a person. She's a dog person. I really like her. But her mouth and her mind are working really fast.
00:34:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry.
00:34:44 - Chona Sweet
Hold on.
00:34:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So do you know what she wants? Like what motivates her? What is she happy with anything in work? How long has she been told?
00:34:58 - Chona Sweet
old is she? Um, I would. Let's say she's, I don't know how old she is, but she's probably like early 50s, yeah, mid 50s. She has been with Dr. East since the beginning, which is, you're due to the 2017 honey, he's probably about the same or longer.
00:35:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
She's been around for a while, she's like theoretically quite like 10 times kind of situation.
00:35:24 - Chona Sweet
They have a very, they have a relationship like Mark and Mary. However, she is more vocal than Mary in terms of, and this is what I don't agree, but then again, Dr. E allowed that to happen, but she would call him out and call him, like when I say call him out, like they argue verbally, very, you know, other stuff and hear it, which again, that's their relationship. But, um, but her as a person, we talk and we actually gone into, you know, a deeper level. She, you know, it's just, she's just the kind of person. But I think she doesn't like more work for her, which she verbalized. And with this new up to 300,000 patients coming in, she's overwhelmed. So she's hiring new staff right now. Um, that's what's happening. So in terms of the PI, this is not her priority, if, to be honest.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, that's important.
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that's, that's where I come in. She really thinks that I will help her off low without taking it away from her. That's what it sounds like to me.
00:36:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is a very clear distinction. Um, so then you have a conversation about that. With her? Well, I think. I'm not really sure. This is this is one of those things that takes some finesse and maneuvering. So, and it works better with time, which is, he's not patient. Mark's not patient, so that doesn't work out very well. But Mark, so here's the reality. If you don't take time to finesse and massage it, either Chona is going to fail because that it's just not going to be worth it to her emotionally to do this, or Cheryl's going to leave, or like something is going to blow up.
00:37:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. Before we left, we added the lunch with Dr. E, and he said, he's going to talk to her about the clinic, but at the same time about the PI. Because he, Dr. E, he's supposed to hope. hire someone to be just in charge with P.I. calling the patients, creating that connection with the other lawyers or whatnot. So that is the plan, but the immediate plan is to create an email and phone number supposedly. Just for P.I. because I told him I'm going to attend in November, I'm going to attend this thing with Dr. Choy. That's a networking event. I need to be able to provide a card with the email and phone number that you want that someone will have to answer that phone. That's right now our phone system, our current patients are mad because they're calling no ones answering. They're leaving voicemails and the staff go to the voicemails whenever they can.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I think one thing that might be really helpful and without creating a lot of friction is start with an org chart and roles and responsibilities. the P.I. structure isn't 100% knew he's done a little bit of P.I. right?
00:39:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Unfortunately, yes.
00:39:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chona coming in and the arrangement that you have is really a new kind of beast and a new structure. So it might be good visually to outline an actual like org chart of what the structure looks like, maybe like a company within a company or whatever, however it looks like, but then roles and responsibilities so that there is a very clear visual without even talking to Cheryl about it. Coming to the table with this piece of paper that shows Chona is not a direct report to her that Chona is the head of her own little kind of department. Look, because otherwise you're going to have this battle.
00:39:51 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So You are in my spirit.
00:39:54 - Chona Sweet
I think you kind of know because we're contractors. knows that the way in her mind, because again, I've talked to for a long time, I feel, every time go talk to her is like three hours. But anyway, on her mind, she's in charge of the business side, part of it, the logistics of patient appointments and insurance, and also in charge with Medicare paperwork on the providers. The medical side is Dr. E, so that's how she's structured in her mind. So if there's a problem with patient care medications, it's Dr. E. But if there's a problem with, I guess, Medicare or whatever insurance signature we need to do, it's her.
00:40:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within that, there's, what I'm talking about is delineating a difference between P.I. and any other patients. And thinking of that as almost like the silo inside of the business. So that, and within that realm, you manage the patients and the finances and the operations that now, Mark, you were making a face when I was talking about the org chart and all of that.
00:41:22 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So a little bit, because like, she's like a merit. And so in my experience dealing with have a thing.
00:41:30 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, what? No, I said that that's that. Unfortunately, like Dr. E, that's what Mark allowed to happen. Same with Dr. E, that's what he allowed for Cheryl to talk to him that way.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't agree with it. Because because it's not delegation, what's the word when you you why can't I think of this word? It's driving me nuts, freaking hairy menopause didn't ever used to have this happen and now it's just like tip of the tongue. Anyway, um, an abdication, abdication. And Mark, you're good for that, by the way, abdication, an abdication, abdication, they've got it, whatever. Anyway, you're doing amazingly better now too, but this I think is a similar situation where it's like, out of sight, out of mind. I don't want to handle it. I'm going to, if I can yell at you and tell you to handle a certain amount of things and it comes within the realm of what I'm okay with, then that's all I'm going to do. And that's the situation. But the problem is you're trying to build an optimized structure within a chaotic structure that the two aren't very compatible. So either I mean, like, now if you were just putting a person into this, it's a whole not a business. You can burn through people. This is your wife. So Oh massaging it well and making sure that it's not like ruining her in the process is little bit different. But you have the ability to drive it and here's how you do it. The angle is always the numbers when you show people the numbers when you show them. This is what's on the table that we're not getting to, but also here's the cost of this structure not working properly. Here's the cost of you letting somebody be in charge who doesn't even understand the value of this and why it works this way and why it needs to work this way. This is what happens when you don't follow up with people and we're trying to build an engine that generates money. But it has to operate in a particular way because PI is different than everything else that you've been doing all of this type of stuff. But so if you can sit down with the data, whatever data you can have, it can be some forecasting and some projections and just say, look, this is this. This is what it would look like if we're operating a capacity, this is what the finances look like, this is how many patients we have, and then let me break down operations for you. Let me tell you how I imagine it would look like, right? One person has to be in charge of this. We have an automated follow-up system, it does this and this and this for scheduling. We've optimized charting, we've done all of these things, and then you really don't have anything to do with a doctor, except for you house it, and you hire Chona, and from time to time we have meetings in conversation, so we're all on the same page and making sure everything's flowing. Like that's how simple it is, however, it's only that simple if Chona is empowered to be able to build the structure that has to happen. So are you in or are you out? Like really, that's the conversation. Now, however you finesse that and negotiate that, that's up to you, but I'm telling you, the clearer you get, and the more data and vision. jewels you bring to the table. And I'll give you a reminder, every time we needed to get you on board to buy into something, it happened as a direct result of we got numbers.
00:45:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And then you're like, okay, and seeing it what are the issue that she was facing is if Cheryl thinks you're trying to go either directly around her or just not involving her in some way, shape or form. I don't know if she's going to go to the point of trying to sabotage. We're trying to make things just significantly more difficult.
00:45:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So hold on. So this is an if, right?
00:45:39 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And we can do if all day long. We don't know. Okay, with a relative degree of certainty that if we try to go around her cut her out, she will actively get significantly more.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I agree with you. I agree with you. And what Chona is dealing with is alpha females type of thing. Like if you're the head girl in there, another woman coming in, it's almost most always, it does not work out very well. So, but, but Chona is not that type of person, but it doesn't matter, because it's their perception. That's all that matters. So, but this, this is why Cheryl needs to, I would have the conversation with Dr. E first, and then with Cheryl so that she could recognize this is a silo. This is a thing within a thing. So it's not about cutting you out. I'm taking nothing away from what already exists from you. And what I'm bringing in, you wouldn't have if I wasn't here. So, you don't need to worry about that. But here's what I'm going to do for you anyway, while I'm here. I would love to help you with some of your systems and some of your things and help improve your life. you can do that, Chona without taking too much on yourself. And I think that you can bring some improvement, but, but while you do it because your stuff is not her stuff, it doesn't matter if she adopts it or not, right? And it could just be being a friend, being nice letting her vent, like whatever kinds of things. But she needs to be able to physically see and wrap her head around how this doesn't exist and be very clear that it didn't exist without you. It's here because of you. You're not taking it from her. You're bringing something in new that has nothing to do with her, but exists in the same building for all intents and purposes. And either she can wrap her head around that or not. And then you guys have to deal with this and make a decision. Is this compatible? Are you willing to work under those circumstances? Or do you need to draw a line in the sand? And if so, draw the line. But either way, be very clear about what you are willing to do and not willing to do and don't put it in somebody else's power with their attitudes and whatever. Either figure out a way that's compatible or find somebody else to do this with.
00:47:55 - Chona Sweet
I thought, well, I talked to her. You talked to her, Marcus. me and I and her talk and you know that that is the the common thing that we're trying to say is you know how can we help you make it a little easier for you but bringing it in so like for example like the chat system that I start today again it's like saying hey this is coming you know it's kind of like me in a way telling them this is coming now and and so I think she is on board um she's overwhelmed with the new new optimizations but and I think Dr. E recognized the burden on her and that's why Dr. E said he will hire someone else it's more a full time because right now there's a part-time person doing the PI which is cast um which is related to Cheryl again it's very close to it but um I think we are there so it's just more of a rating I think right? Because we already talked to her about this. It's just more of really happening now. The main problem is someone who answers the phone. We need someone who- There's a lot of issues.
00:49:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, there's a lot. And you know, both Chona and are trying to figure out how to approach this in the way that gives her the highest chance of success, right? Because it's a lot of different factors and a lot of different factions. And his practice is obviously very, very different than what my stuff is to some level. Same time, it's also very similar to what I have to go through. And Dr. E recognizes that what they do currently is not going work for PI. Cheryl also recognizes that what they do is not going to be good for her period. So the good news is they both recognize that there is an issue. Neither one has a solution for the issue, but at least they recognize the issue. And so another part of the reason to kind of with light of fire under this, I guess, for lack of a better term is when people see that it's actually a fire that needs to be put out, then they tend to pay a little more attention to it and put some more resources behind it. So is that the most ideal way of doing things? No. But you and I both know, like, especially when I'm like, , we're really behind this month. What's going on? We started taking into things.
00:50:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Then we mark, which is last time you called your vendors?
00:50:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? No, it's the same kind of idea, right? Yeah. It's Joan, are you paying attention? So, you know, it's not saying she's not paying attention, but like you're immediately going to get her attention one way another by saying something like that. Yeah. Here, Dr. E is focused on making more money. That's the only reason he's doing PIs, not because he wants to help more people. Sure, that's part of it. But he's doing this because it's another income stream. And Joan is doing this because it's going to make her more money. If it doesn't make her more money, she's not going to put up with this extra stress and headache because this is more work and this is more stress than just clocking and clocking out. There's no doubt about that. But Chona wants to make more and wants to grow and you have to go through pain in the to get there sometimes. This is gonna hurt at the beginning. I don't think there's any two ways about it. Chona's gonna have to do a couple of things that she's maybe isn't comfortable doing because it's not all spelled out while we get it better figured out.
00:51:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think she's doing amazing. Every week, this is the perspective that we have to have and you have to take Dr. E is like every week, there is measurable growth that's happening. So new levels of awareness, every single week that are significant, we're only six weeks in. first 90 days of anything is almost always mostly just information gathering and topography. That's it. It's just mapping. There's learning and understanding and then understanding the layout of the land then coming up with the strategy. So the pace of this is already pretty good. And I know that you're like bigger, faster, whatever. But the reality is, I've built companies from zero to seven figures, my point is that those are small to big really quickly within a year, many times over, but the thing, and I've come into ones that I've just hovered around for like nothing and then just exploded, it happens, the pace of it and the structure is always the same, if they're going to be successful and not implode, which by the way, I've done that and I've watched people grow way too fast with their arrogance and sell too fast and everybody lost their jobs and everybody lost everything because they grew too fast and that was the main goal. So understanding the human resources and the human aspect of it and knowing that the brain can only process so many thoughts in the first place, okay, just learning, then learning how to optimize while also dealing with other people and their personality. all of these dealing with the pecking orders, dealing with all of that, this is a process that takes time. If you're not going to break it. Yeah, anyway, so it's on a good track, but you are the thing that you, it's an unknown. You're building in somebody else's house is the biggest issue right now. You have to decide if that house is compatible with your vision because you're still a homeowner of your own, right? You're like, I'm building a house on your property, not in your house kind of thing. So that's a better reality. So I still need to have autonomy over my house and can we cohabitate? So that's the unknown. Worst case scenario is it doesn't work out with Dr. E. You guys have learned a ton of things and you go take it somewhere else. But you need to, there has to be a possibility that, and It comes very powerfully with this energy of a take it or leap it. It's the power of like a few money. Basically, it's like, look, we know it's going to work. We want to be compatible. We know that this is your property. This is everything that you're doing. We want to do this with you, but understand that we're bringing the strategy, the awareness, the skill, the expertise. We're taking care of your clients. We're managing the tech, the billing, the whatever. We are optimizing everything and you get to read the rewards. What can't happen is you pull out the rug from underneath. That's the cutest off of the knees. What can't happen is you create a bottleneck that closes off everything when we've discussed having open flow and making this happen. So your energy, even if you don't say the words that harshly needs to be like, okay, we're working together, but understand.
00:55:00 - Chona Sweet
I'm driving this whole thing and that was the point is that we're driving so You know you brought out a good point because I feel like well first I'm new and the expertise and I'm feeling you know, I I going over that hump of You know feeling self-doubt or whatnot that you know, I wanted to drive this Within Dr. E stuff, but I feel like I'm not confident because I don't even know the the terms that's being used You know that that's that and the second thing about the building is he has his own thing I think the majority of it the main point is he still he doesn't want to let go of the full control because he obviously the contingencies of what if I leave he needs to make sure that he can control that Yeah, we started and he's gonna benefit that I can
00:56:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
help you with that by the way. This is just a conversation that you have. So sometimes I work with new clients and I'm not 100% sure that I want to stay there. And I will let them know that ahead of time. But what I will also tell them is if I grow with you to a certain point and I decide, you know, I want to go, I'm going to replace myself. I will hire and train and insert somebody and you will still be better off than you were when I got here. So you can't replace me and you should know that I'm that invaluable that I never had anybody be able to replace me. But what I can do is build a structure and train somebody and train the rest of your team and also be available for consult afterwards. So but what you should not try to do is try to own me, try to control me, try to pigeonhole me because I can serve the best being free to work my magic and do what I do. So yes, you're, you're new at learning these things, but you aren't just you, you're, you and Mark together. Um, you have just because you don't know the specific terminology and the processes and the way they do things doesn't mean you're not incredibly intelligent, powerful, um, innovative, all of these other things, right? So I go into people's businesses. never know anything. Everything is brand new. Like I understand business theory really well. And if I ask enough questions and get enough answers, there's probably no where I can't bring a tiny bit of value, if not a lot of value, but I have to be able to have enough experience. I have to be able to listen. I have to be able to observe. I have to be able to watch for a long time to wrap my head around it to bring any value. So it's all potential. It's all there. But if nobody answers questions for me, if nobody lets me watch anything, I can't give anything. So there's no point in me being there and if that's okay, if I'm not wanted and I'm not needed, then I shouldn't be there in the first place But we're under the premise that you're wanted you're needed to facilitate this particular thing Therefore you need to be given all the things that you need to including the time and the space To wrap your head around what exists there rather than coming in with a grenade and going okay We're gonna just build this and blow everything up. No, we're going to figure out how to be symbiotic We're going to figure out not only just how to coexist with each other, but you feed me I feed you we're nurturing and nourishing each other in This thing that comes with strategy strategy has to come with knowledge and wisdom and experience which only comes after certain amount of time but somebody has to be able to Articulate that and have that conversation and make sure that there's an awareness that this is what's happening because most of time and people are like freaking neanderthal level conversations, money, faster, let's go. Okay.
00:59:08 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know what you're talking about.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I wasn't honestly, Mark, I've got lots of experience with lots of people and you are not that brute force. I mean, I hear it, but then you're like, yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm talking about there really are people that just can't even comprehend the things that actually have to happen at all. You have at least beacons of awareness that fles for a moment.
00:59:35 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. I think, you know, even Dr. E, one did he say that he told that to me I think a week ago, I think he's also trying to think in his head if I'm worth this. And I think when he, when I was taking care of a meeting patient and I called whatever, I forgot exactly what happened. But he said, actually you do. feeling, helping with the lean cases now is, you know, is really worth it. He said that verbally. So it's like, okay, that's good in my life.
01:00:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to give you a strategy that you can use. And that is, you know, when you're wanting to ask for something and do something. So not only can I help take the lean cases off of you and ease your burden there, but I can also add blank. So you want to remind him what he's already acknowledged. And you want to remind him that the because because people forget, Jonah, they forget what's good. They forget what's right in front of them. They forget the value. People do that. They do it in their relationships. They do it in their habits. It's just it's human nature. So you want to remind him there's already proven value. I'm going to bring more. You didn't even know like this could happen and how good this would feel. Now, you know what this feels like, wait till we actually get going. So kind And I suspend your stress and your doubts and your disbelief and, you know, let's get at it.
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
Speaking of the devil, he's actually calling me.
01:01:09 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
can call back and do a conference call with me, you and him.
01:01:15 - Chona Sweet
You want me to talk to him for his waiters, other stuff we need to talk and I'll call you.
01:01:20 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Plus, I mean, to me, you work with plenty of these types of founders and everything. They get excited by Shiny Ball without any help. That's him.
01:01:28 - Chona Sweet
That's you and him.
01:01:32 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, hey, here's Shiny Ball with how this coming through, because it's been 45 days, so like the newness of Chona is kind of wearing off like, yeah, because you I mean.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't mean she's not. No, no, no, no. I do get you. That's why I said, oh, but that's actually the perfect timing to do the numbers and the forecasting that I'm talking about. And look at on paper, this is what we're talking about, and then saying, this is like, so then you reverse engineer it. So what's the capacity? Then reverse engineer that across the timeline and go, okay, well, here's where we're at now. You know, if we grow at 5%, 10%, whatever, and make it a reasonable, taking all the things into account, like how, what we could do that. So what does that pace look out? How far are we away from this number? And if you're going six months, nine months down the road, and that seems like forever, it's not, because how else are you going to get there? six months or nine months from now have all that revenue coming in, and this additional stream with all this new systems and understanding, and you just, that you could potentially go apply somewhere else, like a whole new level of awareness on top of the revenue stream. You can't wait six to nine months to, to let that be built out and, you know, deal with a little extra.
01:02:53 - Chona Sweet
Like, where does he think he's going to go get that revenue without any effort anywhere else? Right. I think the only number that, You know, Mark told him that he's kind of that his goal to reach is the 400 patients a month that cap that mark that's from that He can calculate how much it will be Do the calculations for him in a spreadsheet?
01:03:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We can do it on our next week's call if you want to we can do it in the middle of week We can have a separate meeting to do it whatever, but and we can we could do a little whiteboard It's too late right now to be able to do that. gotta go check on my daughter But that we could do that together or you guys can do it, Mark You've got it. You've got enough experience to do that, but basically What is the pace potential so I know from Fuji's marketing and his timeline like 18 months from now for sure You guys could be doing that But you know with all the experience that you have and and the SEO cuz Fuji did his own SEO So you're also a jerk into difference that Chonazim is an advantage that Fuji doesn't
01:04:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
And the reason with the people I work with of, hey, there's a conflict, but I want to make sure, you know, show those taken care of with working with good people makes total sense.
01:04:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, nine months from now, that's an entire possibility, but, dude, get out of the way, like, either you want it or you don't, you don't get to want to and control the things that you don't understand. Yes, you're the doctor, but there's more to the business aspect than having a medical degree and going and handling the patients and even owning the business. Like, this is his, this is not his realm. You're coming in and you're taking the mental load of it, organizing it, masterminding it, structuring it, and facilitating it.
01:04:46 - Chona Sweet
So, my question is this, before right now, short term, if I talk to him right now, and he said, did you guys do the emails? That's no. Okay. So, I'm going to have all new, I need my business card with my email then. then I will be the point of contact from this for this new patient as of right now. And then the second one would be phone numbers. Now, this is what I wanted to ask you, and also I'm going to ask myself, do I put my phone number there for right now? That's my question. It's like, can I really do that? What if I'm with the patient talking to a patient and all of sudden there's a lean call that I have to answer or...
01:05:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I'm going to be to backtrack. So building the optimal system means doing things the wrong way once in a while. Sometimes you don't know until you try it, and then you might get a Google voice number that's not your actual number so that it's separate just for this business with that face for Mark.
01:05:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He told me to do this for two months straight.
01:05:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, because you want to be able to segment things and not have your number be attached to all these things.
01:05:57 - Chona Sweet
just opens up a can of worms. Oh, that's the best.
01:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You could do Grasshopper, but Google voice is easier, it's cheaper, it's less hoops, it's a shorter learning curve, I mean, it depends on what you need to do, if you need to have a complicated phone tree, then Grasshopper would be better, because I'm not the pending pincer miserly, but I also do the level of intuition that's needed to be able to organize it. The bottom line is figure out what you need to happen, how you need the calls to be handled. If there are options like logic, if this then not, if they're calling at this particular time, if I want to be able to press this number, if I want people to be identified ahead of time. Like if you, and probably would be useful if you really think this through like, how could I process different types of people, can I give them option one if you need this option two if you need that, Grasshopper would be great for that, and then you can actually use the phone system to kind of help process people. Faster even just by putting them in the right category priority, whatever. So, you know, I you're triaging right I get to this person faster because they Raise their hand for this and that type of thing.
01:07:11 - Chona Sweet
So Then the grasshopper do like if there's a number that I choose and we'll put it on the That will be the one that we will send out Can it be one transferred? to a different number once we have the main person who is gonna be answering calls or what once we have the Ask them the questions because all numbers have different transfer rules depending on where you're transferring from and to the reason I was suggesting grasshoppers That's why I use my first start my firm.
01:07:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've used it.
01:07:43 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's it's it's a great service Yeah Yeah Yeah, and To your point you can make phone trees like okay, it goes to let's just use castes things It goes to cast castes and pick up then it goes to chona chona doesn't pick up then it goes to x then it goes to y You can make the phone trees, so you've got the backups, or you have all of them at once who are picks up, picks up.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So the first thing that I would do is the two of you to do this together is map out what would be the most strategic way to process any types of call, right? If you could have the phone system working for you and make your job as easy as possible, what would that look like? Then you go look and say, can I do this? And what's the priority? Changing the number isn't the priority. mean, if you have existing business, it's a thing. could have some issue. could potentially lose some business if you change your number. But if everything's going, well, why would you change your number? Number one, and number two, people can, we all have cell phones now. not like there used to be a roll index where you went and write things down.
01:08:53 - Chona Sweet
You just be like, hey, save my contact. Okay, believe me, I've updated.
01:08:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
know what I mean?
01:08:58 - Chona Sweet
I did. Before I forget. I forgot already.
01:09:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait.
01:09:03 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I was just going to say, we don't want to use the Dr.
01:09:07 - Chona Sweet
main number because right now it goes to who the hell knows. Okay. I remember now. Also, I wanted to make sure that there is a way where we can delineate, okay, this is coming from Chona because if they call that number and it goes to pass, they say it's for Dr. E's. You know, that's what that's why I really wanted my email to be the one, the point of contact that the email on the card like here.
01:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have the. I love the way you're thinking and so the hierarchy of all of this is first you have to have a conversation about what is the actual goals and values that are driving because if somebody has an issue with a decision that needs to be made, the decision supports the goals and values. And they're getting in the way of it, then, okay, something is not aligning, right? Either this is the goal or it's not. If this is the goal, what the hell is your problem?
01:10:09 - Chona Sweet
Why can't we do this? now, there's two. One from him that's currently on, which I'm also taking care of right now. And he said he didn't say the amount, but he said he will also pay me higher on those because I'm taking care of them. And this is mine, the future one. And he said it's 50% of each consult and 20% of procedure. This procedure, I don't get because it's coming from him. So that's why I really wanted to deal with it, you know, but that Mark said whoever he's not working now, but it's going to be very hard. But I don't think Dr. E is going to, you know, he. He's a reasonable guy.
01:10:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's going to be going to vote. Really? like your show says his, he's not really going to like push.
01:11:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it makes sense even just like I'm on GoDaddy.com like Dr.
01:11:06 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
E. Payne.com was available. Like would it even make more sense to just build out a separate site for his pain management stuff?
01:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They went to quarantine to build it up. Probably, but you want to think about it a little bit more through just to make sure that like you've thought about all the things that you need to think about. That's all.
01:11:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Because two separate email programs can be difficult for someone to handle.
01:11:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yeah, what is the whole picture? what does that open? And is it going to, for one small reason, create more problems than it solves? Probably not, but I'm just saying it's not as like, yeah, just QKN doesn't mean you should. Yes, there's simple logic in that, but the business is complex and it deserves the thought about every aspect and what are the adjacent issues, secondary, tertiary type of. of consequences, potentially, of creating that. Does it trigger any trust issues? Do they feel like you're trying to siphon anything off?
01:12:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
would be asking for is OK first without.
01:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right. But the answer to my point is think about it, talk about the right diagonally, all of these different ways, explore that. But the one thing that you guys could do that would be the simplest thing, and just get a piece of paper and write it out. So where do all, where does the business come from? How would this business be handled? How would this business be handled? You could take a picture of it and send it to me, and I'll create something more professional, kind of flow chart. Mark, if you could, and I'm going to give you a homework assignment, and Tony, you can neck him forever. But what do the numbers look like if we get him 400 clients? Like, how did the finances work? How does he get paid? I guess Fuji does it, but he has a whole team of people that help him with different things. So what I need to see is the game plan written out. If you do that for me, I will help you come up with the pitch to basically be like, look, this is how I need you to get on board.
01:13:20 - Chona Sweet
I will be able to handle it as long as I don't help with the main thing.
01:13:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just need you to write everything out. And if you can kind of do it almost like a flowchart, my map, so the segments build the containers and write out like this so that I can visualize it. But also then I can help you with handling the conversations with Dr. E and Cheryl. So anything that's related to Cheryl, if you can draw a little circle and kind of show me what Cheryl does and what you can do to help. I might ask it'll probably inspire questions so I'll ask you some other questions but we will get a physical representation of visual of what's happening and then where we're going and how it helps Cheryl and how it looks good for her how it helps Dr. E looks good for him and you guys because when people can see we can literally on the same page because a page actually exists does that make sense um it becomes very powerful there's always an epiphany and aha like holy crap that's not what I thought it was every time right Mark so um we didn't get to some of the other things that I have but that's okay that's the pace and the priority has to be what it is so just tracking your time and having that awareness that you did have right you can only learn so much every week you keep coming back with this this new something so Keep that up, you need to encourage yourself and know that you can't do all of the things, but if at the end of every day you can look back and inspect it and go, I learned this, I did this better, I made this grow, got traction here, I got momentum there, whatever. If you have a few of those to look at every single day, there's nothing wrong. You can't be superhuman and you should go to bed with some peace and be able to relax and go like, I progress today, I move things forward.
01:15:31 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it's, you know, for right now it's just more of me getting faster and, you know, with my between being patients and charting, because some of my colleagues, they do it, the follow-up patients, they do it right there and there. I've been charting after, I've seen everyone. I do chicken because, you know, I do my notes little here and there and then I kind of perfect it after. It's really just making sure I don't charge the entire night.
01:16:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I want you to think of the driving analogy.
01:16:11 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:16:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:16:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
in a parking space for 30 minutes doing nothing to implement your phone is not going to get you to a spot you need to get to either.
01:16:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. No. Decompressing. That's called decompressing mark.
01:16:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I will slap you. You're just called procrastinating too.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't her sandwich. Then I know. Yeah.
01:16:33 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Mental. She has food in the fridge.
01:16:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She has it. Mental. I don't even think you understand the mental load of a woman. Like it's a whole not a thing. It's not, it's not picking. Like our brains are different. Our brains are different. So I could be wrong, but I'm just saying it could be just a decompressing. Don't be nitpicky. Damn. She's doing good.
01:16:58 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
01:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:17:02 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You know, you know, but most of you are in better.
01:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, maybe you can like, do you get more and better? Yeah. Yeah.
01:17:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. Not a $406,000 bag nice and sweeter.
01:17:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, no. Money has nothing to with literally got paid to $406,000 bag and we're both like what the F is. Why?
01:17:26 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I know. I know.
01:17:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The bag of my house costs.
01:17:30 - Chona Sweet
Okay. That's a bad world. It's just crazy. And there are people that.
01:17:35 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So how many patients do you need to see to get that? No.
01:17:39 - Chona Sweet
How many houses could you build in the Philippines for that? Seven. saying no to this is, you know, something wrote me like I wouldn't even dare. It's not a matter of weekend, it's a matter of like, no, that one. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. will make sure that I will, there are information. Questions I need to get from him like we talk about we don't know if he's done the email yet was a plan because if not, I will just push it to just be my email in that.
01:18:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Draw that thing out for me because I can help you with that conversation and Mark, there's a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
01:18:23 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So there's also if you're not first, you're last and second place is the first loser and I won't and so when you are in your death bed at your end of your life, what do you think you're going to be thinking about? You know, same thing with my dad that I still work to finish because that was all the way to the last day.
01:18:41 - Chona Sweet
So that's probably what's going to be for me.
01:18:44 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I just want to be realistic. know that's up to say, but I probably agree that would probably be how I end.
01:18:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was it happy?
01:18:54 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
01:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right.
01:18:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm just, I don't even know what to do with that. think I was happy. My dad was happy.
01:19:01 - Chona Sweet
He's kind of drugged up. He was drugged up at the yeah, no forgiving too much drugs that helped him to sleep.
01:19:12 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
that's okay.
01:19:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How's this care is rough?
01:19:14 - Chona Sweet
It's fine. We have to.
01:19:17 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
doesn't matter.
01:19:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Neither here nor there. It's only theoretical. didn't. Okay. Well, we have wasn't leadership part of our studies.
01:19:28 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What happened?
01:19:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leadership. Remember how we discussed leadership for a long time?
01:19:34 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
There's also jumping in and figuring it out instead of having everything.
01:19:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just go.
01:19:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Just go.
01:19:42 - Chona Sweet
faster. Now, I called you before to have us call and I don't know if you can hear it from me because I'm not sure of what even to say but you just you told me you're good.
01:19:57 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good.
01:19:58 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
01:19:58 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
You're good. We're fine.
01:19:59 - Chona Sweet
Everyone likes you. I mean, works out, but it's of that talk, though, Mark, can we have more of that talk?
01:20:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What? it always works out?
01:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, just positive, like positive.
01:20:13 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I, okay, I'm only you.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to understand the different drivers. Everybody has different drivers. some people, like, if you say that they're going to sit on their laurels, and they're not going to do anything, and they're just going to, you know, like Tyler. Tyler? Is that the right guy? Tyler? Right. Okay. Then there's other people who will take that little bit of praise and multiply it a hundred times over, and they'll want to go get more and work their butts off. That's who you're married to. I promise you, I saw your eye roll.
01:20:47 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we've also had a discussion yesterday about how just hiring people is the solution to all of your problems, and having someone else do things is not the solution to all of your problems.
01:20:58 - Chona Sweet
We talked about that one.
01:21:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How's that? How's that relevant?
01:21:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'm missing something.
01:21:04 - Chona Sweet
Because I said, he mentioned about Dr. Dr. Fuji, I asked him like, how fast does Dr. Fuji talk to his patient and telemedicine? He said five minutes. That's not enough to get the history. And Mark said he have a VA virtual assistant that gets the medical history for him, all the relevant information and the type it in. And then I said, you know, like right now my mom had a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist and they emailed her the pre, know, type in your information. But, you know, that's that was my question. And I said, maybe later on, you know, I can have someone that can do that for me, which is basically the VA. And, you know, but when we get busy, that's what is.
01:21:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you get busy, you're going to need to do that. But right now, the more that you understand about the operations from the ground. The better you will be at hiring, leading and delegating all of that to people, but for sure, but, you know, tuck that under your cap for some energy for later is that there could be help and you can spend more time kind of strategizing and doing in the high level operations and getting some assistance, but there's timing to everything. And at the end of the day, all I'm saying, Marcus, just be more encouraging.
01:22:25 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I would not be putting my reputation on the line. would not be putting how much time in her in general, if I didn't believe that she could do this and do these amazing things. I'm taking away from my own energy, from my own time, my own resources, my own reputation, because I want to see her succeed and do well and achieve what she wants to achieve.
01:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so all I'm saying is, no matter what you say to help her, at the end of the day, you're doing great because you can measure the things that she's doing well. And if you need help measuring what she's doing well, come to me, I'll be happy to help you with that.
01:22:57 - Chona Sweet
How can I get her to go faster?
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm coming to LA.
01:23:01 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I'll meet with all of you in person Ronan's big puzzle do it. Big Can I come hug Ronan? I know Ronan tagged both Jonah not yesterday because he hasn't seen us in a little while and he was adorable.
01:23:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just get me a plane ticket and I'm come down and visit everybody and I'm just and then slap you once and I'll take a sandwich okay bye. All right Thanks for paying attention. appreciate that show. Mr. I want to go faster. The way that you do that is do the job. Write down what it looks like. What are the numbers if he gets 400 patients like what what is the revenue to you to him? Whatever what does that look like? And then we have to figure out what does it look like operationally. So how many patients are being seen every day? How many people like who's seeing him is Jonah doing all of that. So we need the structure that you're aware, written out, I'll have follow up questions, but from there, this is how we draw the map of, it's basically the treasure map for him to look at, and you to go, do you want us to get to the treasure or do you not like.
01:24:17 - Chona Sweet
Well, he loves to.
01:24:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, so get on board with the show him what he needs, like you're going to need a shovel, you're going to map, you're going to. Exactly, exactly, but it starts with that. So if you do that, and then Chona helps me with the operational imagery, then by the time we talk next week, we've got a really solid game plan for the next conversation that you have that really should be impactful. The only way it's not going to be super helpful and get you. To do some traction with him is if he's just not actually wanting what he says he wants, but then you'll know, because if it's that in his face and clear. here. And he's still cognitive dissonance, right? Saying one thing and doing another, then you need to make a decision like, because if people can be faced with all of that and still operate contrary to what they say they want with all the evidence, that is not going to change. That's a personality trait. That's an operational trait. That's not, you know what I mean? So, but then you'll know, and you'll know very soon. So, get those visuals. You know what the assignment is now? Yes. Okay.
01:25:34 - Chona Sweet
And Shona, you? Yeah.
01:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And also, Tina, taxes are Ronan pictures.
01:25:42 - Chona Sweet
Very happy to receive them. Thank you.
01:25:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, you guys.
01:25:47 - Chona Sweet
Have a good night. will talk to you soon.

Hey.
00:00:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you today?
00:00:05 - mark sweet
I'm just a little overwhelmed, but can't right?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Um, I am, I'm in pain. So I'm struggling mentally. if I stumble over stuff, bear with me. It's not for lack of preparation and effort. I'm just struggling. Um, so.
00:00:37 - mark sweet
For like 20 seconds, because I've been trying to skip a guy on the phone and.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Totally.
00:00:43 - mark sweet
Okay.
00:00:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't worry about it. Yeah. Okay. You
00:08:00 - mark sweet
You Okay, sorry about that.
00:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
back. Hey, good. Oh, I was make sure I was unmuted. Okay. Uh, everything okay?
00:08:45 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's a case that we do have to file or settle and it doesn't not make any sense to file on the it would not be the best interest the client but defendants. Maybe not telling the truth about how the vision happened and so I'm helping Tyler on the case and talking about. supervisor to try to figure out a way to get it done because it's dried on too well, so.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I had to get my brain back because it was so quiet for so long and I was just like in his own and then you popped in and I was like, wait, what? Anyway, okay. Oh, all right, let's try it. I gotta, I really gotta focus. Um, so I'm just going back and forth between Patrick's and Lorenta's notes and kind of trying to figure out where to start because there's, there's multiple topic points and none of them are, well, it's all a, um, you know, a long runway, right? There's, there's, there's topics to be addressed now, but none of them get fixed like that and some of it's just information to use and to move forward, so. Again, I always have these like multiple thoughts and they're all related, but I can only say one thing at a time and sometimes I wish we could just have like telekinetic, telepathic, exchange. Huh?
00:10:13 - mark sweet
Let's save a lot of time and energy.
00:10:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know, right? Oh my gosh. Okay. So anyway, um, let me, let me think about this. Yes. So there's a few different types of things. First of all, the overarching one is I don't know how much time you spend leading your team and training them versus telling them these are the goals, hit them, we're short of them. So could you draw that picture for me a little bit?
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Yeah. Um, so there's formal and informal. The informal is pretty. much daily where I'm spending a lot of time with the attorneys going through talking to them. Hey, there a case you're working on? What are you working on right now? And especially with like, say a Patrick or Lauren's or Hank, where they're relatively new. And so whether they actually need my help on a case or not, I don't really care for say, I want to go through and I want to see what their thought processes, right? There's plenty of times where they need help, but other than that, I want to see what their thought processes make sure it's the same as what our thought processes because it takes time to train. That would probably be the more informal part of it. Obviously, we have our own Slack channels and yeah, they know what their goals are, know how far they are, far they are, but also making sure that we're setting a standard and implementing changes and making sure that, you know, those changes actually stick because people tend to slide back, right? Especially when it's going work. So like the whole second voice thing, I'm now forcing them to put into the resolution tab, who did the second voice, if it's out of all two limits, rather than just having some reason not to do it.
00:12:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Second voice?
00:12:12 - mark sweet
Yeah, so if they don't get the full amount, they have to have another attorney call to see if they can get more money.
00:12:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it.
00:12:20 - mark sweet
It's not them. Because of my experience, a pretty good percentage of the time, they get more. And it may not be a lot. Sometimes it does, but it may not be lot, but it adds up over a lot. So like, you know, Lorenz helps. Patrick helped Lorenz on one. was like 500 bucks. Not a huge amount, but the fact that it happened is good. I did want to get an extra like five grand, so like it adds up again, spread over files. Right. It's not always 200 grand. and or something like with Tyler's, which is funny.
00:13:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are we tracking that, by the way?
00:13:04 - mark sweet
We are now, so you're gonna have to put it in. So, you know, even if it's an extra $1,000 a case on average, it's right over 100 files a month. That's another, you know, $100,000 a month, that's 33,000 or 40,000 of attorney's fees. That's significant.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure, that is a very leveraged activity. That's awesome. When did you start that? Last week, they knew to do that, but they weren't doing it, so now we are forcing them to do it. How long has it been known that you needed to do that? Oh, a very long time. Can you ballpark that?
00:13:47 - mark sweet
A year plus.
00:13:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Who do you have that is watching to make sure? like you just probably answered it but I'm going to ask anyway that procedures and like standard operating procedures are being followed.
00:14:10 - mark sweet
And that's more merit than anything else but the attorneys sometimes do their own things and so anytime they settle the case they announce it so it's all like a slap channel so it's pretty obvious if it well they say whether it's all two of them or not so it's obvious if they didn't get the full amount so from there it's not going be very hard for me just to you know spot check or double check to make sure that there was a second voice.
00:14:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I just want to make sure I understand this correctly that should have been something Mary noticed and corrected.
00:14:44 - mark sweet
Mary tends not to get super involved with the attorneys.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not actually answering my question directly.
00:14:51 - mark sweet
Um I don't know it's probably on me.
00:14:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It seems like from everything I know about you and what you value and what you want to do and not do, that oversight is not what you want to do most. So ideally, if we can wave a magic wand, would you not have somebody who was responsible for oversight and just making sure that the things that, so to me, the more powerful thing would be for you to determine the procedures that would generate the most revenue, protect the most revenue, prevent the most bleed, that type of thing, right, visualize, visionary, plan, all that. And somebody else monitor and direct, train, whatever, having received that instruction from you. Would that not be the most ideal thing if it were possible? If we could just have it?
00:15:59 - mark sweet
No, I tend to agree. with you. Honestly, I don't know if the best one to even figure out how or what that change is, right? I'm probably the one who notices something, but I may not have the best solution for it.
00:16:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so one standard thing that you could do, if any time there is a specific thing that should happen on all cases or anything that could be just specified, right? So if we don't hit 40% on attorney fees, automatically invokes the role, second voice, that can be checked and unified, right? And as many cases as you have, I almost think that you could probably have your best case manager in the firm or even hire a case manager just for these types of things, and their entire job is to monitor all of the cases and make sure that everything is going according to sweet law procedures, because so they do have to understand how it works. They have to be good at what they do, and but they need to be the type of person that are just they like data, they like greeting, they like evaluating, they don't get bored with it, they pay attention to details and they can just report it to you. It wouldn't be their job to coach or counsel or to tell anything or to fix anything, although that could be a separate thing, but generally that type of personality doesn't go well with the coaching one. They're very different types, that's a very analytical personality, they just don't make the best coaches. The only reason I can do it It's because I'm weird hybrid right down the middle of all the analytical type empathetic sorts. Just right down the middle of all of them. Anyway, again, these are, these are, we're just trying to kind of formulate what's the ideal thing, not creating more bloat in the system, not creating more, what you call it, expense payroll or anything like that. But, um, how many cases, let's see, I don't know, that'd be, that'd probably be a full-time job in and of itself, but if we have to do some math, so what percentage of your cases, how quickly and can we go on to litify and do this just to go, because the math would tell us how, um, feasible. it would be just from where we're at and then it gives us the place to aim for where it might make more sense, if it ever makes sense. But it's definitely going to be worth our time to do this little basic math right now. But if we go look at total attorney fees and we would have to have this data. So does LIDIFY have like, could you get a report where you look at total fees collected and total settlement amounts so that you could easily calculate, did we get the 40% that's not gonna work because we've got minors, so we've got some contracts where they signed it better. Okay, well, so it's still like, it's just a matter of finding the right math to get close to what we're trying to figure out what we're trying to figure out. out is um how much roughly potentially it's not going to be exact because of things like that um also let me check mark we added i think is more what you're getting to yeah but we only just started that like a month or two ago we don't have enough data yet okay second voicing adding into it we don't have enough data yet we will but just not quite yet and i'm really interested to see what the average increase with the second voices right i so are you making sure that you're tracking enough statuses like that you have all of that categorized so that the report will be able to be pulled to see that easily uh i don't know
00:21:00 - mark sweet
I don't know. Right now I just want to get the data into the system first and then we can kind of figure it out from there. The reason I'm saying that is I don't know if it's on the separate field and then it's not on all of them so I feel like I'm making it more confusing than it needs to be.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the simplest way and I'll go back to what it started for us to get data in the first place because Lidify was so confusing would just be to create a spreadsheet that's that's it could be team-wide and suite-law-wide and that would probably best since they're all helping each other and it could be just second-boy spreadsheet and it is here's what we started with here's what second-boy Scott is and we're just keeping a running total until we can figure out how to use Lidify to get that report. So you've got the numbers we can be looking at it.
00:21:58 - mark sweet
Yeah we can just make it how much did you increase? something simple, and then there is a competition between the most economic.
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep.
00:22:07 - mark sweet
Yeah. Okay.
00:22:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So. And you have competitive people. So I think that that would work out really well, but also you get some real time numbers pretty quickly, where we don't really get quick. Financial type numbers quickly because of how long cases take to settle. But that one has a quick impact. Okay. So back to informal contact, you say that's daily spending time, talk with them, talking with them on what I'm working on. Is that a phone call to each of them individually? Is it emails? Is it slack? Describe what that looks like in a little more detail so I can envision it.
00:23:06 - mark sweet
So people in the office is usually personal face to face. Which is always my preference because you can.
00:23:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's going on with the person?
00:23:19 - mark sweet
Otherwise it's slack or zoom. I won't call that but every now and then but it's more slack and zoom. And this is outside of obviously our weekly calls.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When we calls our team calls.
00:23:37 - mark sweet
There's. All legal team and all the terms. With the one exception of paying. Every Wednesday, nine a.m. I have a meeting with him because he's still right now. And since he's not here, I want to have something more formal. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, how, how, what kind of, there's kind of two ways that I want to ask this question, and I'll ask them both and then you can answer, but what kind of leader slash coach slash mentor Do you see yourself as and how do you think your people see them? Specifically the legal team, not anybody else since we've lost. The one's response.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
I'm generally a compassionate helper. That's just an Instagram type. That's generally just what I am. Which is fine. So I'm more than sure they see me as someone who is helpful. Doesn't I? shipping and like I never make them feel bad for asking for help in any way, shape, or form. want them to be comfortable asking for help. They also will generally see someone who's incredibly driven, sometimes as a positive, sometimes less than negative for them. Beyond that, someone who gives their word, I think they're probably the main things.
00:25:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to ask you if it would surprise you because it surprised me that the perception that I get is that you yell and are upset about not hitting the numbers a lot. I'm going give you more than that because there is more than that, but that was the first thing.
00:25:54 - mark sweet
Oh, I definitely get ticked off and they don't hit their numbers. There's no doubt about that one. They don't hit their balls or their expectations. Yelling, I don't think I've raised my voice, like, maybe once here.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is the perception that, like, I'm told I am a lot and I'm like, you realize that I have this volume when I'm happy and I have this volume when I'm, like, excited or whatever. Like, it's sometimes people perceive, raise the volume as yelling and when it's just the person has a wide range of dynamic and volume, which you do, you go from very, very soft, like, I can't hear you, to, you know, I wouldn't say booming or anything, you know, but there's definitely a wide range of dynamic where most people are not monotone, but they're definitely, their wavelength is more mellow. So What's interesting to me, because I think, highly of you, I think you are, I think everyone is really lucky to be able to work for you and with you, knowing I don't, I'm not your subordinate. So my experience is different. and I know enough, though, to know that they are, because I know how you care about people, I know, you know, who's been fired, who's not been fired, what, you know, what you've done to find a home for people and create safety and all of that. So I'm not biased, I'm informed. And, but there has been, you know, they're not negative or derogatory. So it comes differently between the two of them. One being afraid to lose a job, Lorenz, and I'm going to say this because I'm also going to show how when I've, when I've told them, I think that they might be perceiving. things through a lens of with well for Lorenz where he's worked before and Patrick is just you know I don't know I think that they're attaching to the the frustrated voice more than anything else and not taking everything else into account. So the conversation last week with what was it last week might have been last week but it's it's been a few times anyway so Lorenz sorry because all these conversations kind of kind of run together because there's bits and pieces of them. So the timing isn't so much relevant but I think we had a breakthrough with him or he realized because I because he he's like they don't say things directly I infer 100% so I'm gonna tell you that right but I'm good at that and so Oh, I asked him, I said, are you, are you afraid of getting fired? Are you afraid of losing your job? And he said, yeah, I mean, my numbers, he's like, I'm, he's like, I'm not, I'm, I'm so slow. I know I don't hit the, the fees like everybody else. And, um, cause I'd said something once about your value of him just being steady at least. And, you know, reliable. um, he just really brushed that off. He's like, no, like, I don't, he's like, he was very worried about losing his job. And I said, um, how many attorneys do you know who have been fired at sweet loss and cheap and there? And I think he said one, I'm trying to think who it was, but I know it wouldn't have been anything, anybody that was supposed to be there.
00:29:47 - mark sweet
it was a quick, I don't know if they went to R.E. Was here. I don't think he was. That's the only train that would even be remotely close to time wise. Yeah. Actually, Maria, we had her, but she was a lot better. She was only one of us for like a day. we were like she was a terrible thing.
00:30:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right and I said because I was struggling to remember who it was at the time but I'm like okay so then I used Cynthia as an example. I said Cynthia has moved around but Cynthia didn't get fired even though people have struggled with her. What does that tell you and he just kind of like oh you know and so then I asked him so I told him about the the surveys that we've done and the training that's come as a result of them and and also asked them you know do you feel like you have a hostile work environment other than the fact that you feel like because they're not meeting numbers you're afraid of losing your job have you seen any other evidence that you know that your job's in jeopardy or that you feel like you have an unreasonable employer or even somebody that doesn't care and he's like no no no like all of those things. Um, so sorry, my brain just went out the door for a second. Um, going to put a knife out on that. Please, please, please.
00:31:10 - mark sweet
Um, He's kind of a .
00:31:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I guess for lack of better.
00:31:14 - mark sweet
Um, he's got the most. Staff of any group and his numbers are generally on the lower side. So, you know, should he be concerned? answer is kind of yes, because. If you're constantly on the lower ends. If you have the most help, you had a lot of cases still has a lot of cases. And you're not meeting where others bar and you're in a state where your minimum is higher and you're able to stack policies, and you're able to get more. You should be number one.
00:31:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So. And then this is where I need to be. clear to because on what your thoughts are. So you do tell me and obviously I can't, I can't, I don't tell him things and it's not appropriate to tell him. So I tell you everything, he gets a filtered version. So just to be very clear about that, obviously. But you have told me about your frustration with his pace and everything, but then you have also told me that he just he's kind of slow and steady. So I really want to be clear and understand your thoughts on him as clearly as I can so that I can be useful to you primarily to sweet law first. Lorenz is secondary, right? Helping Lorenz is the benefit to sweet law. That's my priority. So I really need to be very clear on where he stands, what like If you have a, because sometimes we do this and we don't necessarily say it explicitly out loud to anyone, but do you have almost like a timeline in your mind or numbers in your mind? Like if I don't see X by X, I got to let him go. Keep being in mind that we both know how hard it is to find new attorneys.
00:33:21 - mark sweet
And that's the issue, finding a new attorney, finding one that's so the reality is, over time, his assistance, people writing his demands is three or four case managers will probably go down. But there is someone, we say, what's someone who's steady, know, he tends not to piss off clients. one terrible review, but like just the nature of our business, right? it just is what it is. And so he's just slow, right? It just is, I don't think there's necessarily a way to change it. He is scared and look, he didn't have the best situation as previous job. He tried to do his own thing and it didn't work out and he almost lost, know, everything over that. But, you know, as marriage kids, everything else. And so, you know, that's why we do try to go out of our way to include him on things, which, you know, look, find the dude out here. It's not exactly cheap or easy, right? Right. Go out of our way to do these things so he does feel like he's part of what we're doing.
00:34:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:34:36 - mark sweet
But, you know, to be a little bit freaked out that you might lose your job is maybe not the worst thing in the world, either.
00:34:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I understand that. And so, but there's, there is this strategic balance to have. And it is that, so you're familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? Mm hmm. And what do we know about being stuck at the bottom? you, you can't be the best version of yourself because basically you're focused on fear, you're focused on pain. So, and this is what I was explaining to Lorenz, I said, you're going to have to get over it. And he's like, you know, I'm a dad, I have four kids. And, you know, he got previous trauma. And I said, I get that. The problem is you spending so much time ruminating about how badly you're doing is keeping you from being whatever kind of powerhouse you could be on the cases that you have because your energy is not there. Your creativity is there, not there. Your best problem solving is not there. And we do video calls so I can see him just pondering on that and realizing, you know, that he's kind of keeping himself in the foot by focusing on how bad he's doing, not that he shouldn't be thinking about it, but rather. other than then poor me, poor me, poor me being driven by because Patrick sees his numbers and hates them and goes, but I'm going to kill it. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. going to do this. So same situation in terms of like not being where they want to be completely different response to it. And because we're having the conversations together, Lorenz inspired and afraid from it.
00:36:33 - mark sweet
I'll get to that.
00:36:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But the difference is, and this is what I told him, I said, you know, I said, has anybody ever hired a coach for you to spend time with you and try to help you through issues? And I said, he said, no, it's okay. So that's something unique about Mark. And then he said something really nice, like you respect me and think good things about me. So that was cool. But he was like, That's different. Okay, so anyway, so what I'm trying to do is kind of get him to stop moving and spend more of his energy just shoulder to the wheel, get the work done kind of thing. Hold on, let me go back to his notes. Oh, so when we, so when I brought up the point that we've done surveys and from the surveys has come trending like Black Swan and like grief counseling, he said he didn't get the grief counseling training and he would really like that because he feels like he spends a lot of time with that and that it affects him to like some of the other people who mentioned it when we did that survey and that makes sense that that training would be beneficial to him. So I'm wondering if anybody who hasn't been through that, if you could get another one or just kind of ping everybody and say, hey, would you, would you like a referral?
00:38:00 - mark sweet
pressure course.
00:38:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:38:01 - mark sweet
can only do that for intake. We didn't do that for anyone else.
00:38:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:38:05 - mark sweet
So there's only like three people on the firm outside of intake that deal with death cases. And he's not the one of them.
00:38:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why? Okay. All right. Well, that's a little enigma. Um, Um, um, he hasn't gone through it.
00:38:30 - mark sweet
They don't see what those.
00:38:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just wonder why it was even something he would want. So now I'm confused more. Um, okay. Okay. So let me go back to, we're kind of probably going to spend most of the time on. Lauren's stuff today because he is the bigger thing. Oh, okay. So I was looking and let it fire. Okay, just because I was going back over the comment that the email we had about Patrick and when his incentive kicked in, so I was trying to look at the attorney fees report and there's a one that says attorney fees this month and it has the settlement verdict amount but the gross attorney fee and the net attorney fee column is empty. I'll share my screen and maybe you can help me see what I need to see to kind of track that. Where's my share screen home?
00:39:34 - mark sweet
Part of this too is that I would like to put it up as long as I can because it just literally means I'm paying out more.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm the one wanting to see better profit margins so I get that but I do also want to see so to that end the more that I understand about any of the attorneys and their processes and How sweet law operates the more insight I have about how we can do the parallel business that is optimized So for me, there are a few things going on my dogs going nuts right now. It's really hard to think All the barking yes So I've got, you know, overall maintain, not maintain, but optimize sweet law as it is kind of thing.
00:40:41 - mark sweet
I've got You may have to work with the detailed row tabulator and just get rid of that.
00:40:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Look a little easier. Oh, okay, this one Okay, you may I just totally lost one turn up. So anyway, so I have multiple tracks I'm working on all the time. Number one, the overarching one is how does Mark make the most amount of money with the least amount of risk and the least amount of effort and the most amount of freedom? That is always my MO for anyone and everyone. Within that, there is sweet law as it is that I get to have my hands on and talk and work through you. There is the individual attorneys that I get to look at the reports, things like that, and then potentially seeing if there is another, so up until yesterday, yesterday, Monday. Yeah, anyway, Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Up until yesterday, I was thinking it was, you know, Modify sweet lot as it is into something else over time working into this more optimized thing but the thought yesterday and makes so much more sense to me is to have a micro version of the optimized, you know business and Try to grow it from a seedling first Minimum viable product and see what we can do but everything that I understand about the mechanics and the operations and the nuance of it and and where the revenue comes from and all of this The more that I can contribute something useful to that in the meantime though Sweet lot is not something that's just going to dissolve anytime soon And so optimizing what you have and knowing you care about actual people and their family so even if you could just be like I'm gonna walk all the way from it you would not because you wouldn't need everybody hanging like that. So it's a matter of trying to massage all those different you know parts of it and anyway so that's it's a lot to take into account so um understanding this okay so you see what this says it gives me this but not so if you're any two different reports because it's not to make sense otherwise.
00:43:35 - mark sweet
Okay um so I don't know what is for May 2024. Who asked what 2024? I don't know why I was saying May 2024. Okay anyway um get rid of the detail bros.
00:43:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes and then open a new tab.
00:43:59 - mark sweet
And then in Okay, let's just do one at a time.
00:44:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go back to what you're Okay.
00:44:05 - mark sweet
This is a good way so you can see what's been settled this month.
00:44:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:44:11 - mark sweet
So you can see the total settlements by attorney, right? I think that's helpful. Now I'll look in the report that is called average and just AVG fees by attorney.
00:44:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I that's popping up. This one?
00:44:34 - mark sweet
No, I'll hit all reports because you're just in the recent and just type AVG. Space fees.
00:44:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
one.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
I just made it for this month. Okay. This is how much they brought in
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so do you mind if we just go back month over month for the last three months real quick? Yeah. Okay, so I'm doing this right, right?
00:45:21 - mark sweet
here.
00:45:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this month, well I'm just gonna, ah, and I'm going to to do customize, just change that to seven, seven, likes. Good job, Patrick.
00:45:47 - mark sweet
No, the average fee, please don't look at that because it's just not correct.
00:45:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I wasn't. Okay. Okay, oh yeah. That reminds me, um, so because I was asking if I asked the guys if they could see these reports, and what Lauren said was that you send out towards the end of the month, but not exactly end of the month so they don't have total numbers, basically a report like this, and then he tracks it, he has his own spreadsheet, and from that we actually showed him how to create averages so that he's got one column with everybody's average, including his average, and one of the things that I was showing him is like what you should be doing is not so sometimes we have bad months. I'm like you don't obviously you don't want to have a bad month, but if you can continually increase your average, then you know that you're moving the needle forward. So even if you have the bad month, but your average didn't go lower, then your overall trajectory is you're still improving. Well, if it went higher. So that was helpful to him because he didn't have that and he didn't know how to make that formula and he doesn't have this, which you said the average fees aren't even right. So anyway, so I'm trying to help him to understand the data also, but I was impressed that he was tracking it and trying to keep it, but he doesn't have accurate numbers. is there a report that could be made just for the attorneys to have access to be able to see how they stack against each other where they could go look at the revenue? Is that a bad or is there any version of the report that could be good for them to see?
00:47:45 - mark sweet
Yes, especially because they're all so competitive.
00:47:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:58 - mark sweet
There is. just trying to find which one it is.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, it's all worth waiting for because that's what I'm here for, like, if we can get them to drive themselves, but be more clear on data also. And the fact that Lorenz wants to know rather than burying his head in the sand actually says something good, he's not just waiting for the ball to drop, he's like, what can I do better? So, to me, that's workable. It's not a fast workable situation, but it is workable. I'm going to look at other months where you look at that up, so, let's see, oops, go And I would love to see this as a plotted chart month over month, so I don't want to go do this manually, but also just like look at that steadily.
00:50:14 - mark sweet
Okay, I got something that's more slash better. Yeah, I know.
00:50:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me know when you're Okay.
00:50:44 - mark sweet
What? Look, a VG attorney fee.
00:50:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Reports. Sorry. Oh, I didn't realize that reset there.
00:51:03 - mark sweet
By attorney two years in top. This is the last two years of data by attorney.
00:51:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Okay.
00:51:17 - mark sweet
Relatively accurate.
00:51:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So average for a month.
00:51:24 - mark sweet
This is two years of data put together. Okay.
00:51:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is their total over the two years. Is this average correct? Well, we could do that math easily, I guess, huh? Should be. Okay. Robert is the litigation attorney? He was. Yeah. Okay. It's not. Okay, that's a huge disparity, Tyler, holy heck.
00:52:23 - mark sweet
Um, refresh the report real quick. I just took out anything that was a zero dollar attorney being, because think it just goes from this off, because there's reasons for it that don't make sense.
00:52:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
makes sense. So, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't look different. Um, at all. That's, this is interesting to me. Well, that's only 17. So, that doesn't mean anything. Um, cases. So, she's done in, uh, But how many years is this is two years? The rounds was around for two years. Yeah. Yeah. like a full two years, right?
00:53:08 - mark sweet
Pretty close, I think.
00:53:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Me too. I feel like it was just over two years, because I feel like it was like February and Marchish or something. That could be wrong. Anyway, to have double the cases, but then for Tyler to have 120, 112, more cases than Lorenz, but his average be 2000 less.
00:53:44 - mark sweet
Yeah. Just refresh real quick. It's a small change, but it's great language blank or zero. So this is an up-to-date language.
00:53:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hmm. Is it a five-point? OK. Oh, that was our six. I'll refresh the whole page. I have a Mac on the PC. Okay.
00:54:16 - mark sweet
Yeah, okay. That's a pretty accurate number.
00:54:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so this went from one ninety eight to one ninety six. This was three ninety eight, I think, or three ninety two. So still the. mean, I know you can't replace him. And I know that he's a pain in the butt and this is how much he brought in. So, and he, whatever he cost you. It wasn't that.
00:54:52 - mark sweet
Yeah, but look at the average that was eleven thousand two thousand more. Times three hundred and ten. What would that number? I know I get that.
00:55:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's that's the whole problem with this whole thing is the biggest thing is that you can't get to people.
00:55:13 - mark sweet
It's six hundred and twenty dollars of attorney's fees. That's literally money in my pocket, six hundred and twenty grand difference.
00:55:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why we do numbers, right? So what would it cost you and this is the conversation that we've had before about how much you pay people? What would it cost you is to replace him? Could you hire somebody that you? Okay. So let's ask this. What do you pay Tyler? Including bonuses, huh?
00:55:47 - mark sweet
It gets worse than I'm. She's already been like two or a year.
00:55:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And how much in the two years did you say? Was it like six hundred thousand? Yeah. So he, he cost you 500,000. I'm just trying to think, well, 200,000. If you paid somebody, yeah, my brain is slow, but if you paid somebody, let's say $350,000 a year, and they made you an extra, well, let's say that you, you hired another Samantha. Yeah, I mean, you'd still be winning.
00:56:31 - mark sweet
That's the problem. We can't find them. If I could, I will, in an instant, it's not a money issue. It's a person issue.
00:56:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, the reason I'm asking those, because it's been ages since we've had this conversation, but you use my memory is that you were adamant, like, I'm not to hire and pay X. But when we see this kind of math, then that changes everything. of course you have changed your perspective a lot based on the number. So there's that. Okay. So, anyway, I mean, that's really what so much of this comes down to is you can't just go hire people.
00:57:08 - mark sweet
Now, that being said, or building them like Patrick, it takes a year plus.
00:57:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. Okay. then here's another way to look at the math mark. Is there an investment that can be made to make a person like Lorenz better? Does he need, you know, so you're already doing this, right? And so one of the things that I'm really good at is a perspective shift of looking at the data and using it to your advantage, creating systems. like, he had conversations. What do you call them? Reviews, you know, anyway, with his people. And he said, yeah, we do this, you know, about monthly. I'm like, about monthly or monthly. He goes, well, I missed it last month. And then I missed it in February and one of our I'm like, okay, so what are the results of those conversations that you have, like, are you finding out, like, and I didn't want to leave the question. So basically, it was, you know, coaching and feedback and what he could do to improve them. but the result was that there was something important that came out of those conversations every single time I'm like, but you don't schedule them all they make sure that they happen every single month, and he dropped his head and he's like, no, I'm like, well, how can you expect consistent improvement if you don't have a system to ensure consistent improvement. That happens consistently. So it's a really basic thing. But I'm like, I buy next week the next time I talk to you, I want you to have scheduled that and he goes, well, sometimes, you know, people. people's schedules like they don't work and will schedule something and then it can't happen I'm Lorenz you could find another time and he's like because last week someone saw his own vacation I said so your solution is to wait a month and then not have it rather than just reschedule he's like no I'm like but that's that is what it was so I'm like if you are if you really want to be better and instead of feeling bad about your numbers and kind of feeling like a victim about your numbers then you've got to drive and and this is how you do it so anyway I can't see having such an issue like I can't move my zoom window and I can't see what I need to see in a thriving minute anyway so ah no not that yeah t-ness issues don't need to do that um oh so anyway so as I'm digging in with a little bit more so so now I have targets detail pros made that go away so I'm going rock my head around this a little bit more and do some math about what would the improvement be a value to you? So I've never had that before. So we've done this math when it comes to leads, vendor sources, like we look at how much does it cost us to acquire a retainer and what's the average attorney fee was. We had that math and so we've done it in terms of evaluating vendors and states but I haven't done that at the attorney level and so now I can do that working with Patrick and Lorenz and seeing what kind of improvement and optimization we can do that first of all pays the bill for what we're with me and then a second of all becomes profit above and beyond that so what I'm going to be looking for is are there other types of trainings. Can I get a breakdown of what everybody costs? Actually that would be super helpful. Can I get payroll for all of the PODs, individual people, so I can really understand because I'm getting data from the attorneys okay about what are the activities that they're doing so that I can kind of have a cost evaluation of each of the people and the roles and look for those levers a little bit more that way.
01:01:38 - mark sweet
Yeah I mean obviously the attorneys fluctuate month to month.
01:01:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right right but but I can do some averages and calculations and still kind of have you know a ballpark which which is is helpful as There's one thing that's going to throw it off just as a head zone okay because they're attorneys I can pay them referral fees when they bring in a case. Uh-huh.
01:02:00 - mark sweet
Okay. Non-entertions.
01:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:02:03 - mark sweet
So, for example, Patrick had, like his uncle come in, and I overpay Patrick on his percentage, because I want to encourage him to do more and more of that. Mm-hmm.% of the attorney fee on it. So, it's a large hit, right? So, it throws off the payroll numbers in that regard. I'm happy to do it.
01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know this is a little extra work for you, but would you mind, since that can't be a ton of times, would you mind marking, like, what those amounts were when they happened so that I could take that into calculation?
01:02:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, we were starting to separate that out because we wanted to try to get a better idea of what was.
01:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the thing. Whatever the micro version that we built, whatever the optimized version that we hopefully end up building and trying. What we're going to want to take is whatever the best practices are, and because I don't know what that looks like, I think that it's going to be very different. But once we figure that out, there are two, like I haven't even been able to comprehend this as an opportunity until yesterday, which is crazy because in three years of all this talking, like, anyway, but that's the whole thing about pacing and how new knowledge turns into new questions, turns into new awarenesses and new opportunities, and you just have to keep plugging along at a consistently, which we do, so anyway. But the way that we realize the impact of, first of all, a variety of vendors, which Dan pointed out yesterday has been a saving grace because it's eliminated, the dependencies on them. but also just optimizing or understanding that cost. If we can do the same thing and figure out what aspects of the business can you have steadily that fall within a set of parameters that are profitable but very low maintenance, and then more scalable because it doesn't have to be an attorney per se, maybe one attorney that is really, really good at just oversight and catching things or one really, really good attorney, one really, really good case manager and then a bunch of assistants or something. I don't know, but the more data we get about the values in, oh shoot. I'm to talk to them in 20 minutes. get my brain ready. I didn't even realize what time it is. Yeah, so anyway, the more we understand about the the different aspects of the values, the costs, but also what little things that we do that make a difference like second voice, like potentially intake script, potentially ranking lead as they come in, which may not be so much of a thing for the model right now, but could be in the future if we do, you know, optimized version, all of these little things that we've laid the groundwork to be able to understand and now are just understanding. Anyway, that'll be helpful. if I could get a report on everybody's payroll with the anything that's a outlier like Patrick's stuff referrals. Should I ask for that an email?
01:05:49 - mark sweet
Yeah, it's fine. I'm not going to the show on it.
01:05:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, and then week two weeks, three weeks, what do you think that would take?
01:05:58 - mark sweet
I know we'll come the project right now. Can you like at least two weeks because we are in the middle of one of those crops?
01:06:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. All right. But there's a lot more other things. could we do this maybe every couple of weeks for a little while while I get some more traction on this and just kind of have a better understanding, a faster turnaround of talking to them and then talking to you on this on a more detailed level because there's so much to cover and for me to wrap my head around. And if it doesn't work in your schedule, then you can just say, hey, I can't do it this time. Okay. I'll send a calendar across and you just let me know if it works. Doesn't work. I'm going to go from there. Sounds good. And You see a cute little woman today. You could share that picture with me. I'm not talking about my mom yet. Huh?
01:07:10 - mark sweet
Did you feel the earthquake or did you feel the earthquake at all?
01:07:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
01:07:14 - mark sweet
He apparently didn't either. But we got shaped pretty many things.
01:07:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, what was it? How big? 4.4. Oh yeah, we wouldn't have a lot here, probably. That's the biggest one I was ever in was a, I don't know if it was 6.2 or 7.2, which that's a huge difference. was really big. I have to go up above. Anyway, we watched the street roll. It was interesting. All right. You, sir, take very good care of yourself and pet the flickers. All right. I will talk to you.
01:07:55 - mark sweet
Monday. Have fun.
01:07:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. Bye.

Are you guys here together? Can you hear me? Hello?
00:00:56 - mark sweet
You Hey.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, I can hear you guys. I'll hear you. Do I have both of you?
00:01:06 - mark sweet
No, I'm going to do a round then. Hold on, absolutely my mouth.
00:01:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going see you too. I'm going brush my teeth and I feel like I missed something and it's driving me nuts. I'm tired. Hey.
00:01:42 - mark sweet
Is this a home office or office office? No, it's not. The office is the one usually see it with the window where you can see the airplanes.
00:01:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, we're hardly ever on video, so I don't know. Now we've got Chona. Oh, no audio yet. Water. Oh, there. Something. Hi. I am so excited to meet you in person. Well, Zoom person, you know, this person. You're so pretty. I mean, I mean, you're gorgeous.
00:02:26 - Chona Sweet
Oh, thank you. It's probably a good idea.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've got like three tablets, three laptops, one desktop, you know.
00:02:43 - Chona Sweet
Oh, I was drinking a crap.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I thought that the this would be the fastest way to kind of figure out what, because you've talked about what Chona's doing a little bit Mark and like how there's some income potential there and then Chona you're just getting your head wrapped around showing up being the schedule and then also Mark has a different kind of brain those those business brain people it can be a lot so it's a good thing it's just not you know like trying to get on the same page with everybody we all think differently and very intensely so mark if you would pretend I don't know anything about anything and give me just the real like third-grade version of what you see the potential is then we can start the conversation from there yeah so there's
00:04:00 - mark sweet
three income streams.
00:04:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:04 - mark sweet
The first one is what I would consider traditional medical practice.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:10 - mark sweet
So the doctor, his name is Dr. E, just so we're all kind of on the same page. Okay. Dr. E's primary practice is traditional healthcare pain management.
00:04:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:04:24 - mark sweet
So he is the pain management provider of multiple facilities and clinics. what I mean by facilities is hospitals, including health insurance. So he primarily bills health insurance, gets reimbursed from health insurance, and that's where he's paying employees from.
00:04:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:04:48 - mark sweet
That'll make sense.
00:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sort of. is my problem with trying to take notes and listen at the same time.
00:04:54 - mark sweet
So I'm just going to listen and let the AI note taker do its job. So most people who are professional, being doctors or nurse practitioners, those are the people seeing the patients, get paid on a per visit payment.
00:05:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:09 - mark sweet
So you get paid X amount per person that you visit, more people you see, more money you make.
00:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:05:18 - mark sweet
So that is in the hospital, some of it's in clinic settings, some of that is telehealth follow-ups.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
Yep. Now I'm ready to get paid the same across the board, no matter what that is. Okay. So when you generally want to go to places, we're going to see more patients, because if you're driving around and only seeing two patients at each place, you're kind of losing time on money. So let's say one facility, a 17 new people to see and one has two. Right. advertise a 17. So that's the main traditional practice. Okay. Second part is the personal injury practice. Okay. So that's most similar to what Fuji does, from kind of what you know, the difference is Dr. E. he doesn't just do consultations. He does procedures and surgery.
00:06:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:06:07 - mark sweet
So he works with a wide variety of lawyers and other doctors. So we're used to seeing maybe 10 or 15 lawyers that food you might work with, Dr. D for hours 50 of them. Some good, some bad, some in the middle. Okay. And so part of running Chona on is the medical records for a traditional practice versus PI practice. Well, they necessarily shouldn't be this way are different. Okay. Here's what I mean by that. Good enough is good enough a lot of the time for traditional practice. So we're noticing and seeing a lot of dictation service from Dr. D, where it's just dragon dictation and writing the notes. Okay. But there's a lot of typos and misspellings and some other things because it's not perfect. Which the general gist is there. Okay. In personal injury, that causes problems when you get into litigation or further on, because it looks like you're doing what you need to do. And so bringing on Chona is a couple of things. One, being able to see more personal injury patients. Two, having someone who actually can write records and reports that make sense, which is part of what I've been working with her on. There's lot of things that would get complicated and we can jump into those later. Very, very simple right now.
00:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, thank you.
00:07:31 - mark sweet
Now Chona can do some basic procedures as an NP, like trigger points and couple of good things.
00:07:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... Hi, sorry, my daughter's leaving for the night.
00:07:46 - mark sweet
But she can't do things like surgery. She can assist, but she can't do the surgery itself, because she's not the doctor. So the payment structure is a little bit different in that now, legally speaking, she can only get paid for the person she sees. cannot get paid a percentage.
00:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, legally formal, yes.
00:08:05 - mark sweet
So we worked out a version of that that makes a lot of sense for her. And I'm assuming hypothetically speaking, hypothetically speaking, there might be a 50 50 split on consultations. So similar to like what Fuji does now where it's 400 500 visit. So split between Chona and Dr.
00:08:27 - Chona Sweet
E.
00:08:28 - mark sweet
And then 20% of whatever the procedure values are. Now procedure values tend to be much more significant, usually running anywhere between 4,000 up to 50,000 plus per procedure.
00:08:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And why would he be interested in sharing that? Because Chona would be the one who is in these patients and people that I know. And how are you getting around the legalities of that? are you creating some other kind of that kind of person, company, whatever.
00:09:03 - mark sweet
So it's a little C and thing. follow our taxes separately, like everything to keep separate.
00:09:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:09:11 - mark sweet
So I get no personal benefit out of doing this. I just get a happy wife.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I get some personal benefit. That's not what I mean.
00:09:18 - mark sweet
Like, I think referrals, maybe, for example, Christian, honey, I think that's what people that I know. Because again, I know that Sean is going to do a good job. And, you know, a lot of issues are the same things like these pain doctors get really busy and don't do as good of a job.
00:09:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get that. That's helpful because it's a little more onto it. But when you said technically, she can only get paid per procedure and can't really get a referral fee. How are you structuring that?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
You know, there's a lot of marketing costs involved in what she does. And so more than sure, Dr. would be very happy to pay a marketing fee to help her continue to grow. I wrote for a pipeline.
00:10:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it. Got it. Um, valid and creative. Well done. So, okay.
00:10:12 - mark sweet
Um, then there's number three because that's number two.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you.
00:10:17 - mark sweet
It's okay. Um, and number two, number two or semison. Chona does not need doctor supervision in multiple other states. California is one of the few that she has to be under doctor supervision. So, you know, when you go to the doctor, usually see a PA or an NP, like most of the time. Um, in Washington state, she does not need to be supervised by a doctor. There are. What about Oregon? Sorry.
00:10:46 - Chona Sweet
about Oregon?
00:10:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you need to an organ either.
00:10:50 - mark sweet
Anyway, sorry.
00:10:51 - Chona Sweet
Carry on.
00:10:52 - mark sweet
Um, but in Washington state, there's two doctors who have tried to use some of the telemed pain docs that we've worked with before. I'm just going to use footage of the exam. and they weren't thrilled with like some of the reports and just again when the pain dogs get really busy things then you get to sloppy. Yeah. And so because I'm I'm just literally friends with these people they'd be more than happy to send you know about 10 to 20 patients a week to try not just to do consults. She would not need to split any fee because she'd be off on her own without any doctors provision. That's what I like do procedures she can't do anything else obviously.
00:11:26 - Chona Sweet
I can do trigger points.
00:11:29 - mark sweet
You're not flying up to see how to do it right away. It doesn't make sense.
00:11:32 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:11:34 - mark sweet
Because we'd have to find a surgery center or an office and it comes with its own liability and everything else.
00:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean but what if there's a good song skiing?
00:11:44 - mark sweet
You would have to find rent out medical spaces expensive.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:11:49 - mark sweet
Jeez. Whatever.
00:11:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not saying that it couldn't happen in the future but for the short cut. No, no, no. I mean you know I'm joking obviously.
00:11:58 - Chona Sweet
But these are options. I mean again if she gets busy No, up there to go up there twice a week to go and do procedures that she can earn more for than.
00:12:04 - mark sweet
Yeah, it does make sense. The issue is trigger points only pay about 800 each, and she's going to about 450 for a console and trigger points take out as much if not more time.
00:12:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice click and do you and I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway, have a spreadsheet with all of the income earning opportunities and that makes some basic calculations on what can happen. Then roughly how long each of those procedures or types of income opportunities take to fulfill so that you can figure out roughly what the earning potential is.
00:12:40 - mark sweet
In my head, because there's the same limitation that kind of Fuji has, she can really only see about 400 patients in a month, more than that you start paying for that.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:51 - mark sweet
so, part of the benefit with being under the doctor in California is the doctor's going to be signing their reports and records so it allows her to have a little bit more flexibility and to make It's kind of like cheating, I guess, to be able to see more people, not really cheating, but...
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or you could see 400 people and try to get them to come back for other like follow-ups and whatnot.
00:13:12 - mark sweet
More procedures and things. problem on the legal side is this, because the limits are what they are, there are times where you just, even though they may need that procedure, there's not enough money to get that to actually happen.
00:13:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's 400 in a month, right?
00:13:28 - Chona Sweet
It's not just 400 you've ever seen per person.
00:13:31 - mark sweet
Per month.
00:13:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Per month, okay. month, yes. So then, how have we covered all the income-earning things?
00:13:40 - mark sweet
I felt like we did. Those are the three for her. The only other one for me is essentially what we've talked about with Dan is building out a better software, a better way to do this. With Sime, I report writing that could get away with a lot of the issues that we're seeing like Dr. E and somebody's being Dr.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Suffer from. I think that this Steph, me working with Chona is actually probably going to help expedite that. I'll see things that in a different way. So then Chona, let me get to know you a little bit. And now the one thing that I that stood out to me that I was that I'm kind of holding on to is that this is a fulfillment kind of thing like that you didn't really necessarily want before, but do which is like having something of your own, having purpose, not just work, you know, but like something that you're proud of, something that you that you do. But what else could you succinctly kind of summarize what was the catalyst for starting this, what were the things that were happening inside of you that made you say, I'm ready. I want to do that. is because you still obviously have some overwhelm and so not being sure about things, but obviously have enough faith and Mark and in yourself to want to proceed with this. kind of help me figure out like imagine and be there with you when you're like, okay, I am ready and I'm all in.
00:15:23 - Chona Sweet
What was that I think, I'm not sure if Mark mentioned JP, honey. That's so we recently completed more of a kind of individual coaching type service and we it basically helped me I think that'll put it me into myself that I didn't know is there or has always been there but I I just, it's just wake that, you know, passion up again from me. I feel like I've always been passionate and with my career and then life happens. I think I think after my dad passed in 2020, I lost that passion and then, you know, there's some psychological depression with that brief. And, you know, after that coaching, I just have this renewed passion, you know, within myself. And it's like perfect time, you know, when I say it's like just how it happens. Yeah, the coaching finish. And then would you say, mean, a few weeks before I finish, Mark has been talking to Dr. E. So, and then Dr. E again recommended or ask Mark, do you think Jonah would want to? I don't know if I know, you know, the background. I know Dr. E from my previous work. He's a fellow. He's a doctor in training way back in 20 I don't know, 17 2016 no 2014 2015 so he's fellow and I'm a nurse practitioner, but that's how we met with Dr. E at Theodore Sinai And then I introduced him to mark because he the moment he graduated he wanted to hire me That's one of the NPS that I'm not sure. don't want to work too hard And then I introduced him to mark and they clicked cuz they're both you know have that business mentality and Ever since he's been asking me and I said no no no no I don't do this I'm I have an employee mindset I don't think I have no clue anything about business or anything like that. And then finally, I think it's just that, you know, that timing with my personal coach and then Mark talking to him and I didn't even realize that I'll have a second or I have another job at this time. This is not part of the plan. What you mean another job? I mean not another job, I mean a different job, I mean leaving my previous job because this is a new job for me, so.
00:18:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. What were you doing before? Like were you?
00:18:38 - Chona Sweet
I'm still an I'm a nurse practitioner but more of an internist in a psych hospital.
00:18:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, okay.
00:18:46 - mark sweet
Wasn't the last what you're in, you're in a half?
00:18:49 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the last year and a half, like I started part time with them in late 2022 while I was at UCI doing pain management and then I become time of last year of February. Then I've been doing that. Um, but prior to that, I've been doing pain management since 2013. Since I've become a nurse practitioner in 2013. I've been doing pain management. then I said, I don't want to do pain management anymore. I want something different, more challenging. And it definitely challenged me. biggest population is very challenging, but someone has to, you know, take care of those patients. Again, mental health is the taboo, still even on the medical fields, but in no one needs to help those patients. you know, it's definitely challenging. and then this opportunity arrived and then on the timing of the personal coaching, I said, you know what, not? Well, why can I see that person that can make more that I didn't even realize I can? Obviously, obviously with Mark, I guess. push gentle push like you can do this you believe in what i can do so that helps so what parts of it um excite you the most um the autonomy has always been there that's why i became an arch practitioner that's why i went back to you know getting my master's and doctors like i wanted to be a economist like that that's the driving factor and just in context i left UCI even though i'm paying good money i mean okay money i don't think i feel that they're paying me too much because they're not utilizing my full of potential and i don't like that that's why i left that job and that's why i went to the internist position which even though i'm very autonomous it's a very it's scary you know you have to always I'm back with this patient's mark is always kind of worried that I would come one time I came home with a scratch in my face like the patient do that just like no it's either you know it's a high stress environment but so you and money I mean if you're asking about that the income potential is there 100 percent I mean I'm gonna lie it's not if that's not it but it's more I think the autonomy and the fulfillment of utilizing to my fullest potential trumps the money because if it's really money that I'm talking about like UCI would have been perfect yeah I was just gonna say that doesn't make any sense that money would be even in the top because if you left because they're paying you too much and not using you then your perceived value is more important to you like I think so right Hans because remember how I would always complain that I feel like I'm um, what's that term used? I'm a glorified babysitter. babysitter.
00:22:09 - mark sweet
You're helping the residents at UCI because, you know, they're doing doctors and they don't know what they don't know. And while you enjoy teaching, it was just kind of a, you were there just to make sure they didn't screw up something.
00:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so money's definitely not your main driver.
00:22:26 - Chona Sweet
You, you want to serve a purpose.
00:22:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, you might like it, but if she made that decision, money can't be the main driver.
00:22:35 - Chona Sweet
It might be closed, but it can't it's definitely, there's that component of the incompotential of making what two doctors can make in a year. It's definitely there, you know, like I'm gonna lie. But if you tell me that I will be working as what I do at UCI and be a glorified assistant and not utilizing my potential, I will not be happy.
00:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Even if I make that much money. So I'm just gonna delineate the difference between making a lot of money and earning a lot of money. So earning a lot of money is important to you. Making a lot of money is not as much. Right. The difference is just it's slight but it's important. Mark, are you laughing about?
00:23:26 - mark sweet
I don't know, like it's nice things. I do.
00:23:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's okay. But it's still that it's not the same. When you tie how you get the money, that matters.
00:23:38 - Chona Sweet
Right. That's that's what I'm saying. That's right for me to even say I felt that I'm getting paid. I'm getting I'm paying they're overpaying yet you said because they're not doing what I'm supposed to do. I feel like that's a good feeling.
00:23:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean if your husband gives you all the things you you are that because you married him.
00:24:00 - mark sweet
So No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Chona Sweet
No, we're not.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, we're to see you open this kind of words. Okay.
00:24:06 - mark sweet
Hey, she should make double what she's been making before. The other thing too is, when I tell Med Park, it's more and more robust. It does allow us more flexibility, but from a location standpoint, as well as, you know, a time standpoint. So if we want to travel or one of the other things for kids or whatever else, it gives us more options in terms of working time. And so it's not just a single income leader, know, anything else, trying to instill earn her income and what have you while being able from home or being able to work from wherever we are.
00:24:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:24:40 - Chona Sweet
So freedom. Yes, I like that.
00:24:43 - mark sweet
Yeah. So all these things kind of come together. And the timing was good.
00:24:46 - Chona Sweet
Dr. He's been trying to recruit her for years because he doesn't have to train her.
00:24:50 - mark sweet
And, you know, he's like, make, he's definitely more business focused, but it's kind of raining.
00:24:55 - Chona Sweet
He's all over the place. Oh my gosh. He is.
00:24:58 - mark sweet
Because he just takes on every project.
00:25:00 - Chona Sweet
which is okay but you know he needs people who can do what they need to do and so it's a great learning opportunity and she's going to have more opportunity than she would if she joined you know like any other paint tops that it would work like this procedure I've never done this before but doing procedures which I am very much this is what I'm saying like utilizing to my fullest potential although California we I still need it in collaboration with a physician but this is just the first time after 11 years of the nurse practitioner so first time I'm doing a procedure which is you know it's great it's amazing you like learning yeah yes I do I do and yeah all right so now I understand the why and the what a little bit and now we got to kind of figure out the how that works with chona so the thing and I was talking to you about this last week chona
00:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mind is that the beginning is always the hardest, but what I can tell you and hopefully Mark can testify to is that when we really break it down and look at everything, what we're doing is we're going to be looking for leverage and optimization. So what that looks like is for example, you know, seeing more patients in one location, but there's going to be so many things that you're doing that from communication, travel, how certain locations operate, how you plan your day as well as how you start your day. Mark used to start it by checking his phone every first thing in the morning and get stressed out about something that went wrong or whatever, just immediately like it pumps cortisol into our bodies that that's stress of like there's something to do and I'm just like, can you just not look at your phone for a little bit and see how that goes and started working Dolce and there were some improvement. It's like the little things. It's not just the person doing business is the most important part of the business. So we'll talk about a lot of different things and it will start with a lot of questions. So the first step is you've got to get your head wrapped around everything and then you've got to be able to communicate to me enough so that I can get my around everything and so then we can start working together. So it is slow and kind of tedious and overwhelming in the beginning which is why I said you can also feel free to just vent send messages and just kind of vent because even in that venting I'll learn some things I'll learn about you know what's happening and the faster the more we communicate in the beginning the faster I'll be able to get to something useful for you. My standard It is I just talked to people once a week. Although I do tell them hey, you can reach out to me. Nobody does So it takes a long time.
00:28:06 - mark sweet
think you run in photo stuff.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know I know thank you so much I love that doggy. I do take doggy payments Yeah, so You know something was just on your mind and you like this happened and I don't know where to put it I don't want to hold on to it You can tell anybody or you can tell me like I said you can just leave me like a voice You know you have an eye called to right Audio messengers are so great because then it does the dictation and I can just read it if I can't listen at the moment And so I will encourage you share as much as you feel like sharing Because the sooner I get all of that the faster will get there Um because I don't even know What questions to ask right now other than mark The fastest way is to get something that we can all look at so we can on same page, right, which is where, what are the offices, what are the opportunities, what are the procedures, what are the all the things. And it seems very tedious and Mark doesn't like tedious, but we can do another group call and I can extract it and I can create the spreadsheet myself. That's totally fine. But and that process actually works really well for me, Mark, because then I'm getting it firsthand and when I'm putting stuff in this spreadsheet, then I wrap my head around it. So what we could do is just schedule a couple more of these calls until I got my head wrapped around all of the opportunities to even start to formulate the questions. And you know how it goes and Mark can explain this to you is the more that we look at, the more we talk about the more that we see, the more the questions formulate, the more you just don't even know what you don't know. So it's a lot of asking questions and then it's just kind of a rough. It's not really fancy and it's not shiny and it's not exciting, but it gets some results and hopefully it'll help you be peaceful sooner rather than later.
00:30:14 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I feel like everything is up in there. I'm getting used to the flow of the number one, the main traditional, that's what Ricky's He's going to put me because he's really all over the place. He's spread him to the food and he's about to take on a really large contract.
00:30:38 - mark sweet
He's not always going to fulfill it.
00:30:41 - Chona Sweet
So she puts her in Long Beach, which is probably busiest hospital, I would say. Sorry. like my mind no no I have to initiate a lot so like what I feel like I am he doesn't have any plan for me whatsoever I I told him is it okay with you you know being respectful I will shadow this NP you know because I want to know how they do it because the office manager which is Mark's Mary I don't know if you know her but the office manager would tell me don't do how doctor eat that because he does it may definitely you do it the right way so I have to shadow everyone else because I need to know the right way more efficient way so that's what I did yesterday he didn't tell me I have to tell him like I'm doing this is that okay with you sure that's why everything I said sure so I can see myself as my goal knowing what I'm where I am now is I wanted to make sure that the Long Beach Memorial, it will be, I will have, I want to have my roots basically there. Rather than running around, he wants to have a lot of patience, right? don't have that many right now. That's where I wanted to be. If we can get 30 patients a day at Long Beach, that would be nice. Right now, like yesterday, it's less than 20. not a lot. And I just paid per patient. So.
00:32:27 - mark sweet
So she gets between 20 to 30 a patient. So the goals between 30 to 50 patients. And there's not a limit on the number of patients she can see in the traditional sense.
00:32:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So that, all of that is really helpful. And I like that it's going to serve you really well that you recognize his shortcomings and aren't adopting that. Like that, that autonomy, of course, you would want it because you already see how you could do something better or improve.
00:33:01 - Chona Sweet
I already made a suggestion on how to increase, and he's like, oh yeah, we didn't do that, like, okay, this is gonna be a process. I feel like whatever I make decide, as long as it's obviously politically okay, he will say yes, so I have to make sure that we set up dark roots at Long Beach Tomorrow, so that we can see at least 30 a day, that's a goal.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And Mark, how fast can you help, like you said, you know, lots of people.
00:33:35 - mark sweet
I'm holding that back until their systems and reports and processes are right because you get only really one chance at it, right?
00:33:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, your reputation.
00:33:45 - mark sweet
Hundreds of other opportunities plus my own personal reputation side into it. So the good news is he already has some PI patients coming in again from what he's doing before. So trying to cut her teeth on those, she doesn't get the same payout. She'll get like more of the traditional payout, but at least. she can cut her teeth, get under control, get the report writing right, figure out how to actually do a better job making sure patients show up because that's a huge issue for this doctor's office. Now on insurance, they're not showing up, it's actually better for him from an insurance perspective because he's paid a flat rate per month.
00:34:20 - Chona Sweet
I don't think about the procedure though.
00:34:23 - mark sweet
No, no, no, no, procedure will get a little more, but like if a patient doesn't show up to the office on the insurance side for him, he's happier, quite frankly. On the PI side, the personal injury side, that means you're not making any money, any wasted time.
00:34:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's that follow up automation thing that we need to set up.
00:34:46 - Chona Sweet
So okay, he's not very, he's not good, his system is not good. He's hiring more people. There's a lot of non-PI patients that come that they can't get through the phone. So whatever the second income that Mark is saying with the lead, I will have to also drive that and making sure that I am calling, that you're going to have a procedure in this day and make sure you come.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the interim, would it make any sense to do what Fuji is doing and have an offshore kind of team that just does those calls? Because the automations will work better because we can do the text, email call, follow up and it should be cost effective. Plus, we can do all the tracking. But in the interim, without risking your reputation, Mark, and without tona having to be the one to call everybody because that is not the best use of your brain and your time.
00:35:51 - mark sweet
For the problem, we've used Dr.
00:35:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
E before in the past.
00:35:55 - mark sweet
Now, some these have been problems, which tona will be writing them and maybe in. They're okay. It took us multiple months to get signed bills and reports back from him to the point where like a lawyer sued him over and he called me to like to try to get him out of it because he opened for coaching and getting his stuff organized and set out because super busy like I not not yet he's he's going to take over the role mode still.
00:36:23 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, that he's in that mood. They keep would care about what everyone say or he doesn't have any ego.
00:36:29 - mark sweet
He's very nice person.
00:36:31 - Chona Sweet
He just wants to get paid. just wants money.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Chaos doesn't take over the world.
00:36:35 - mark sweet
Chaos blows up the world. And the VA thing, we're getting more and more negative feedback from whether it's Fuji or other people who are using it that they really don't like the VA who doesn't know what's going on and a large accent issue. It's a great idea in theory, but I think is you're trying to scale it unless you have the right VA is a balance and issues. So because the volume for P is low. I'm going to believe we're in do everything yourself first so you know how to do it also. Oh, yeah. But until then long term that is not the solution I've shown on calling and setting up that's not the solution.
00:37:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The answer is I do it. We do it. You do it. It's the way to go. It's what I do too. Okay, so do we have other ideas for how to get more more people per day without someone having to call everybody or is that just that's what has to happen right now.
00:37:32 - mark sweet
So right now in my mind is get her feet under her for at least the next like 30 days.
00:37:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:37:39 - mark sweet
Yeah. Get in your sway. Get in going. Right now she's on prescription running power because everything has to get approved. Like you have to get what's it called for the hospital again?
00:37:50 - Chona Sweet
There's a for any doctor to anyone that can there's a process called getting a privilege in the hospital. So it's more thorough, not just background checks, just more deeper kind of employment, I guess, background checks that they do and it takes a while. So now it's been over a month now from Long Beach, so that will take a while. I'm hoping this month it will be done. Is that what you're saying here?
00:38:23 - mark sweet
Yeah, so again, we can't even really get a lot of stuff started till she's got some of these basic things.
00:38:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out is like, what's the timeline? So if we spend the next, let's say roughly four weeks meeting, if you're willing to come at least for the next couple mark, because yes. So then we can spend like the next couple calls really kind of extracting the the plan, all the the income opportunities, and I'll put it in a dashboard that will make sense. So we can do some calculations and forecasting for some. potential there. And then Chona can give us that insight about what it's like on the inside, how long these things take, how efficient this process is, how inefficient this process is, and really just kind of take inventory and stock of the operation side of it. And then what we do Chona is just kind of, you know, merge and optimize operations with the financial opportunities together. And where we've got the simplest process to get the most amount of money where those two intersect, that's the most leveraged income. So again, it's a lot of gathering, but gathering from from different aspects. So getting marks kind of planned, your information, feed on the ground, and I'll put it together and organize. And then while you're getting your, you know, why you're just getting used to doing it, and we'll be gathering the data that will then help us to create this strategic plan of Okay. Here's what we do for the next 60, 90 days. Then we do that thing, right? we're observing it as it happens, kind of tracking what's happening as we're doing it. Is it going according to plan? What else are we learning, implementing and inserting that data into what we're tracking? And just, it's an iterative process. So we start with gathering information, sort it, make a plan, and wash runs repeat constantly.
00:40:27 - Chona Sweet
So as of right now, I know that I will be my native Friday. Since I don't have the privilege in the hospital yet, I would do clinics and telemedicine. So that's where I'm at right now on the traditional, on the number one, the main job, basic breath, the main job. The second job mark is holding that back until I'm ready. In the meantime, what I'm doing with that is I'm attending Choice Hall and hopefully where we can be a member soon so I can have access to their ideal note system that way I can incorporate that soon. In the meantime, Marcus is helping me. I show him my notes of the lead, the PI patient, and he tells me this is good, this is not good. And I'm in collaboration with Dr. E to make that better. But all of these, I'm going to have to drive it. It's too busy. Dr. E still busy with this. And the third one, Washington, I have yet to submit the application for what we call reciprocity. Since I'm with that, I have to, I'm licensed in California. I don't have to take the test. I just need to apply. So that's what's going on.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Question or question of question of question of yet. If we don't do that soon or you have to have Dr. E. Vouch that you have for an active practice in California either he doesn't need to be involved with the reciprocity of Washington, like I just need to apply.
00:42:00 - Chona Sweet
and it will take a month at least to get that.
00:42:04 - mark sweet
We're seeing like three months usually in the doctors.
00:42:07 - Chona Sweet
Oh, Well, the doctors are probably different than the board of nursing. So I don't know, but it will be the board of nursing. But I feel like the Washington one would be the highest potential for income because I don't have to split that with him, with anyone. So I'm excited with that part. I thought she thinks.
00:42:30 - mark sweet
Well, maybe again, you don't to split it. So her, yes, but volume is going to be the question in the problem. Right. So if there's more volume and more procedures in California, she would make more from the California and Dr. E. Yeah, despite having a split because it all just comes down to volume. And I don't have a lot of volume in Washington.
00:42:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know a couple people, but it takes time to spread. Right. And everybody being, you know, having the same type of thought about it. we create the spreadsheet that I'm talking about, Shona, and having all of that, it's going to make all of that easier because we're going to be looking at it mathematically with just really simple numbers, and it's almost kind of polarizing when you see the different opportunities and the things that happen. So it's not so much like that.
00:43:20 - mark sweet
This too is we would still want her to do some of the traditional because it just makes everything else look more legit. Take Fuji, for example, I know keep going back to him I follow it, but he's got the Q and E work, not only makes him money but makes it look more legitimate because Q and E is generally defensive minded. So it makes him look like he's more fair and balanced. If she's doing also mostly health insurance and working through hospitals, it makes it look like she's primarily a primary trader.
00:43:49 - Chona Sweet
Okay, like how Dr. E said it when he was the post and he was asked like this is the same thing I do with my other patients. It's the standard of care. Which is where I want to be. don't want anyone do anything illegal. Dr. E and I are very much in labor. We're not going to do anything, whether the lawyer says we have to do this.
00:44:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We have to stand on our medical beliefs and what is the standard of practice that's where we're at. Good and I mean, it's not philosophy that ever comes up in Sweet Law, but one of my just kind of like principles is have an unimpeachable character, meaning that you do the same thing everywhere you go, no matter what. I will punch an old man in church if he's invading in space and they're like, I don't care. that's not a good example, but it kind of means that even when I'm in the house of God, if somebody is doing something that makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to handle it the same way. Right. you act the same all the time, you treat your patients the same with integrity, obviously honoring the Hippocratic oath and just being there. to do good, then nothing really holds up unless you're just being taxed crazily for some reason.
00:45:07 - Chona Sweet
So however much and organized Dr. E.S. his patients love him. Like he is a good doctor. Like he goes beyond like sometimes the patient is scheduled for example for epidural injections and they don't need trigger point. Trigger point is another payment. He'll waive that. That's the kind of person he is. And I'm actually, I saw it before when he's in training. I know he's a good person, but seeing it now for him 10 years later, it feels good to be working with that kind of person.
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. All right, now I'm getting a whole kind of picture. And of course, just mark over there being a nice guy with nice people and nice sweet wife.
00:45:51 - Chona Sweet
I do like and she's cute.
00:45:57 - mark sweet
I'm super excited. And so are MPs and people who run businesses too, so you know, yeah, I do I do have friends.
00:46:04 - Chona Sweet
I can I see them their growth and Although I don't want it to say I mean, yes, I see them I get jealous, but I I accepted early on that that's not the path I chose, but now I can say hey I can do this too, okay Yeah, well even in my world I'm in business and I've made people millions and millions and millions and there are female counterparts that I've made way More money than me, but I've had more time with my kids and I coached soccer and I've done all kinds of other things And that was my priority and I picked them up from school.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got them up I made them breakfast I went to school three or four times because somebody forgot a notebook lunch or this thought the other and that was my Priority that was what I wanted to do so every night I got that twins, but you pick you pick what you want and there's different seasons in life So you're in a new season and it's fun and exciting and Mark's got people to help you out and you've got people to help you out and you're, you're gonna do awesome. I'm Yeah, I'm so grateful.
00:47:05 - Chona Sweet
Like I told him. I'm so thankful again. I feel tired today. But again, after I talk to you, I feel re-energized.
00:47:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was, I was dragging. I was like, I'm going to pass out. As soon as this call is over, I was ready to fall asleep. So like, Yay, thanks for that mark, too.
00:47:28 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, look, this should be good. There's a lot of options here. You know, like to have multiple fasts, not just one. I like it. Flexibility is large.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
still want to see the doggy thing happen one day, the doggy food and doggy health.
00:47:45 - mark sweet
I know it has to make money first and be a proven concept and you're not ready. It will happen. This is something that I care a lot about. So, you know, it's about me like when I'm focused, general contestants, but like when I focus on something, it will happen. It doesn't matter how difficult it is.
00:47:59 - Chona Sweet
It happens. It's not a matter of if it's when.
00:48:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I love that tenacity. Okay, well, I don't have any more questions, but I don't know what I don't know, so I don't know if there's something I should ask that I didn't ask. I feel like this was a good start, but anybody have anything else to bring up?
00:48:21 - Chona Sweet
No. I really know my role.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You want me to get the operations on my end so I can input it. I just want you to get your footing. I just want you to do what you're already doing, which is noticing what's working well, what's not working well, and get comfortable and then relay that information and that process back. And I want you to not overthink it. Okay, that will really stress you out a lot. I just really just show up, do your best, and know that you're going to make an impact for him, which is going to make an impact for the patient, and you're also going to be able to earn money that makes you feel good because you will know when you earn.
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
it.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, and just enjoy the process as much as you can. Shoot schedule. So you're gonna have to have evenings for the foreseeable future, is that right?
00:49:14 - Chona Sweet
I think, I think for right now, that's what I'm seeing.
00:49:19 - mark sweet
So, would you rather try to do a morning or no?
00:49:22 - Chona Sweet
I think the moment, like I was telling Tina, the moment I know the assigned patients to me, if I, I think once I get the hospital work done, and then I would know my schedule, like I would know how, because it's just right now, it's still up in there.
00:49:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're the only person in the world, I would be the selectable for, but I'm going to be the selectable them.
00:49:44 - mark sweet
going to the to the selectable I'm going the selectable them.
00:49:48 - Chona Sweet
don't have any, like, what I'm saying is, I feel like you have like a midday even in the clinic, there's a lunch break, but I'm saying that if I have you, two, then I can push back the hospital. What I'm saying is I can go after. Like, again, the only one with the scheduling is the clinic. If they scheduled patients for me during this time, time frame, so that would be it. But the hospital, I have no time there. I would go when I can. If I go early, some doctors go at five a.m. a.m. the patient. Like, like, I don't want to do that. mean, I'm not going to wake up the patient.
00:50:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so right now you are at the hospital every day.
00:50:31 - Chona Sweet
No, not right now. still don't have access. I don't know the moment that I get that. I'm I'm assuming. I mean, I'm not. I'm hoping it will be soon because I I did the process in less than a day.
00:50:48 - mark sweet
Mark knows and everything. Yeah, it's just we're just waiting for approval.
00:50:52 - Chona Sweet
We're just waiting.
00:50:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just waiting at this point. Well, do you want to schedule a week to week for right now, then? If that's okay. Yeah, let's do that. So next week, I have my girls for the weekend, so I like to keep Fridays open. And the week after that, I'm traveling, but we're not going to talk about the week after that yet. So how about next week, Thursday evening?
00:51:13 - Chona Sweet
that work? Yeah, that's okay. Are you okay there?
00:51:20 - mark sweet
I just have something from four to five, but that's it.
00:51:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We don't know.
00:51:29 - mark sweet
You have to come in the evening anyway, right?
00:51:33 - Chona Sweet
Like after that, Shona? Yeah, I'm, I'm the director say evening, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, yeah, so like six or like what time?
00:51:43 - mark sweet
I think six, it's just mark that I don't know what time mark is okay. Yeah.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, well, we said, so I'm assuming that you're not available until evening.
00:51:55 - Chona Sweet
When are you first available and like you have time, you'd be ready for tab a call. I think. I Thursday, I should be available, again, because I don't know my schedule yet, I should be available after five.
00:52:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's what I must, you know.
00:52:12 - Chona Sweet
Okay, I'm just assuming office hours because I like today.
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let's shoot for six o'clock and if we need to adjust it, we'll adjust it.
00:52:24 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:52:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so it will be the same line and we'll plan on meeting at six and I'll send the calendar invite and then next week we will talk about the following week. Okay. And so next week, Mark, whatever you need to have access to or be looking at to be able to feed me information about income opportunities, specifically, like, is actual data as possible.
00:53:00 - mark sweet
I know it's more theoretical unfortunately.
00:53:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, that's fine too. Whatever we have to start with, but my point is that if you can just have yourself either mentally ready, if you have to be at a computer, just whatever, that be able to have that type of conversation will be really useful.
00:53:16 - mark sweet
Look at your word response, Fred.
00:53:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She just has the general numbers, but who can kind of them? That's an better start. Okay, I am so excited.
00:53:24 - Chona Sweet
Trona, do you have any questions? No.
00:53:27 - mark sweet
Did she hear dogs?
00:53:28 - Chona Sweet
She has dogs.
00:53:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, what? They are not here. They are feeding with fluffy dogs. I have a poussaint. She's a poodle and a bee shan and I have a havinese boy. And the poodle has purple and blue hair dye right now because my daughter loves to be ticker to the beach and her hair was just flowing and the little kids are just like, oh it's a rainbow puppy. We love dogs. And we have birds in a bearded dragon also, so what I was a dad And the bearded dragon he's like this big and he loves to just hang out on shoulders and do you see He's I feed it with life In pics, uh, well he gets freeze dried mealworms. He loves blueberries. He loves kale Oh, Sometimes we will get him live prickets. Yeah, that's my daughter. I like lizards in the wild They're very adorable in the wild. Yes I don't think he should be in a cage. Anyway, I don't like cage down Tina is a big fan of the dog food idea Yeah, um dogs. Okay. I'm not going to cry.
00:54:45 - Chona Sweet
So we're gonna talk about something else Yeah, yeah, I'm excited for this.
00:54:51 - mark sweet
I'm for showing.
00:54:51 - Chona Sweet
I'm excited for you know the future I feel like there's dr. A like we're gonna start slow, but then there's a part of me that I'm good I'm ready to go like, you know, like, but then he I think it's in my head and I kind of verbalize it, but we'll take it slow, and it's like, okay.
00:55:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't always don't take anything slow.
00:55:14 - Chona Sweet
They go.
00:55:16 - mark sweet
It's the idea of slow, but it's not crap. This happens and now we're, yeah, we're.
00:55:21 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, the moment that he have at least 6,000 new ones coming in this October, they're already trickling in. So we'll see how that goes.
00:55:30 - mark sweet
new patient's starting in two weeks. Yeah. What? It's like 10 plus people before then.
00:55:36 - Chona Sweet
Well, let's say, and not all of them are paying patients to collect chronic pain. So let's say at least, I don't know, 30% are on chronic, have chronic pain. But basically any one of them that have pain issue, they can't, they will come to us. So, there's that, there's that new thing too that I will, my name. It will be one of the top again, because I'm paying, I'm going to to push out a lot of narcotics, so there's that too. I'm not thrilled, but I'm comfortable if that makes sense, because it's my speciality, but yeah, it's just what it is.
00:56:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:56:19 - Chona Sweet
Buckle up, lady.
00:56:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. All right, well, I am looking forward to it. And I think just a little bit, I've been able to talk to you. I can tell that you are made of some exceptional stuff, and that you're about to be tried in the fire. yeah, but my favorite thing about it is it feels amazing to know what you're made of, but you can talk about what you're made of all day long, and you can feel it inside of yourself. Until you get tested, you don't really know. And the tests are painful, but they come with a level of conviction that nobody can shake. Nobody can make you feel less than when you've done. and the really hard work. And so I'm excited for you to feel a whole new kind of level of who you are and what you're made of.
00:57:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. Thank you.
00:57:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

Hello, hello. Hello, hello.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can't hear you.
00:00:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It looks like you said you can, but.
00:00:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can hear me.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I cannot hear you. I can't of what they're working.
00:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Testing testing.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Testing one to. I can't hear you.
00:00:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I went into my own settings and check like aah.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you?
00:00:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Good, good, 1996, I was Apple support. You're kidding.
00:01:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope. No way.
00:01:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yup.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I supported PowerMax and the first IMAX and I also worked for Intel as a technician and I built networks and I supported their network adapters and so I talked to people in NASA and the Pentagon and helped them fix their networks and.
00:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Holy crap.
00:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's amazing. I can build a network from the ground up like the server including the cables I can crimp the cross over cables and networking cables and I'm a nerd.
00:01:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're really cool. My first when I left Delight Tush I was actually where for computer sciences corporation when I left Delight Tush they had a hundred of me to go into the States and then when I left them in 1999 I started a software company hosting websites in Southern California and cable Tron systems, the competitor at that time to. that? The big one that's there though, didn't tell anyway funded us like over million dollars to use their servers instead for our server farm and it was a brilliant venture capital financing because like they find us as a million dollars but it was in equipment. So it's a win win for everybody right because that was the most expensive thing at the time. So different now right, but at the time like you could charge $50,000 to build a website and host it for these medium sized companies California.
00:02:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have been in it for a while. Corporate experience was my first business experience I didn't like it's really a long time to get comfortable with certain amounts of money and things and realize that that's what I was doing. Because I did the technical stuff but then I became a technical lead but I was responsible for hiring, managing, training, supporting. meeting metrics, meeting with the clients, meeting with the head honchos at Intel and at Apple. And I would also play Peaceball with them and beat them and then get free dinners because I want like what, learning about staffing and understanding the metrics because we were constantly getting threatened with losing our jobs. They would be going to either Costa Rica or the Philippines. And so the reporting was really archaic at the time and we had Lucid technology systems for our phones before they got bought out by Orion.
00:03:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
think it was or the other way around.
00:03:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah. But, and I fell in love with telephony rooms and systems and IT at that time, but so I figured out how to be proactive about learning our numbers and our metrics because what would happen is we would get yelled at, we would see our person coming down the road now. call centers where all most of them were entry-level job positions. Yeah. people come in and be trained and the managers weren't much better. were recovering drug addicts, you know, like the town that I live in, we rank in the top five for domestic violence and unemployment and poverty, and all these other things. And so that was the hiring pool, which made performing well really difficult. And so most of the head level leaders were imported from other places. But anyway, there was a lot of, you know, not really corporate kind of handling of things, a lot of threats, lot of, a lot of, a lot of, lot of things, a lot of sleeping around, all kinds of more accessible stuff. So, but if anything would go bad, you would just see them just down the aisles like, well, what just happened? Well, they got chewed out by Intel for not meeting metrics. And so now everything flows downhill. I got really tired of having my job buttons. I was a mom and I didn't want to like, I don't want to do this kind of stress. So like, how do I figure this out? And so one of my nerdy friends, who was also LDS, I'm more in church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. Anyway, he's nerdy. And I would see him in Excel all the time. might teach me about this and he taught me about formulas. And I'm like, so if I took this report that doesn't have all the data I want. But if I could plug it into this spreadsheet and then have another tab that got this other report and another tab with this other report, I could pull this data from five different sheets and get a summary tab that had calculations that told us exactly where we are at with metrics. And he's like, yeah. So I took about an hour and figured it out. And so now what used to take people days and several hours to figure out because they didn't even know where to get the data. Which by By the way, the same situation I still find with business owners all the time when I asked their metrics, they're like, I don't even know where to get that. So, nothing's changed because that was, you know, years ago. Yeah, 28 years ago. And so, it would take me, once that started to happen, I just did it every week, every Monday I would get my data, took me about 15 minutes, so I'd import each of them and then just go make sure the calculations were correct and make sure I could wrap my brain around what was happening. They ended up implementing it worldwide, corporation as a worldwide company. And it took me probably 10 years before I realized how exceptional that was, had no clue. But they were using a system I came up with in an hour all over the world. Like, I still think about that, sometimes I think I probably don't appreciate the way my brain works. works and but also this is it simple systems yep so nothing has changed people still over complicate things and mostly it comes down to you they don't ask good questions and then they don't force themselves to come up with the true answer so when i talk with people i saw your post today and i'm like i bet we're very similar to the saying but you will probably ask the question and be like oh wait get the answer go ahead that's how i said i'll just be on a call and and they say i don't know i said okay let's find out and we'll have to go look at this and this i'm i got an hour you paid for it let's go get it yeah yeah yeah well all my other questions i love asking on like more like well it's business coaching but it's really life coaching where a lot of them always say like this is not to be about kpi's or metrics but specific to like you know sometimes they don't know the strategy they should do or that's not the right word but that is i always i think what if you did
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, like what if you didn't know, you know, you just keep digging and digging.
00:08:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Tell me more. Yeah, tell me more is great.
00:08:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so that's interesting about your background. That is cool. So like, wow, have you thought about with your background then? explains why you're still going to what you do. Have you ever thought about starting your own software type company then?
00:08:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's a whole lot of things. This is the thing I've had to learn is that I'm really good at a lot of things, which is because I can doesn't mean I should. I'm working on my psychology degree and it has nothing to do with my business other than people also say, can I need you to be like coach Tina today? And I have an attorney in LA and they do about four million a month. And he says, do you help people find their purpose? I was like, nobody hires me for that, but it's happened accidentally. Yeah, you're talking.
00:08:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's a lot of skills that I have, but what I feel called to most.
00:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. is being God's love. And there's just not enough, but there's very judgy Christians. There's very, there's just a lot of pain and anger. But are you familiar with the parable of the seed? Not the mustard seed, but the seed that landed in the desert, landed in the rocks, landed in the, and got blown away. Like there's four different places, I think, where the seed landed. when it landed in good soil, that's when it grew and nurtured. And so I don't have to really preach the gospel. I can be God's love. I can be the example so that when the time comes and they get introduced or they're ready to live any kind of way, he won't be strange to them because they will have felt unconditional love. Because, sorry.
00:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's okay.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But God's house. to the house of water. I bring order to their business and it comes out in their homes. When I help people install boundaries into their lives, into their business, they install them in their daily lives with their spouses, their kids, with themselves, with their friends, their lives change and they become stronger, they come and more independent, they become better leaders, they become more sovereign beings and to me, that's the kind of people that are God's people. So even if they don't really feel like I still feel like I'm serving Him and giving His love. So there's a lot of different ways we can serve but I feel like my best, like I used to post on social media a lot, the reason I haven't been out is because I really felt like I needed to concentrate and think of like when you get concentrated juice versus when it's watered down. potency is different. so there was a time I felt like I needed to concentrate more on my immediate sphere, on my children, on my sweetheart, on my sisters, on my friends, on the closer people. And I feel like I've been able to serve and strengthen them well enough that now I can go out and increase in my circle of influence. But it is really going to be around strengthening people, helping them become their best selves, become the leaders that they can be in their own spheres of influence. And again, there's lots of ways to do that. But really, it is through teaching people, improved operations that, you know, it starts with business, but it really applies to life and they and they overlap because it's people that run business and people that run their lives. I won't be distracted into any other Shiny object and opportunity because this this is my calling for sure.
00:12:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool and it's funny like and I don't know how much work will get done right now this call because we can hook another call right um and don't pay for it. just want to the book. Oh no it's fine. Yeah getting to know each other but that like it's fun you know because we all went through a lot of life stuff over the last few years um when my dad did pass away I like obviously I went on a downward spiral because I was the closest to my dad of all the siblings like and I was the youngest one right so the baby and uh how many siblings do you have?
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's it? How many siblings do you have?
00:12:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Three.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay just wanted to put that in perspective okay.
00:12:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh got you have older sister older into all their older brothers and um I think and I'm the only one that's the entrepreneur the rest are scientists chemists and yeah my sister's a uh doctorate in uh pharmacology toxicology and and she's a cool stuff of children's age research you know. When it. like there's more than 90s and stuff, she's retired now. yeah, the other two are engineers, but so I went the business route. But I think also, because I'm the youngest too, I always I realized after my dad passed away and all this life changes about my own inner work, is that I realized I was doing a lot of things to please my dad. I didn't realize that the laughter. And I also asked my mom a few times because she's very spiritual and I said, know, like, what do we hear for? You know, because it's like, what is this early all about, you know, because that was the first close death to me. And it's an interesting, my mom said, well, it's it's to be God's love, you know, so it's funny what you say, because like, you know, lot of people have different answers, like, why are we here on earth is that? But that's why mom says, it can be that simple, you know, and I'm like, wow, I never thought of it that way. So, so yeah, I'm sure there's a reason you're right. Well, I are process connected. We say, if you're big hug, I'm a big hugger. Oh, thanks. Yeah, yeah, so so I've been having fun the last little bit. I'm helping some people with their their funnels and all that, so. I'm not sure which way you want to go, you know, what do you want to take this call?
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what I want to know is you had notes. You had notes when we talked to you said you have ideas. I want to hear for those ideas.
00:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
will pay to hear those ideas. Oh, OK, I have to go up and get it.
00:14:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's in my I'm downstairs right now. Do you mind?
00:14:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't mind. I'll wait. No, yeah, what I'll do just give me about five minutes because I got to go find the art book. I can't remember whether it's up in my office still or over.
00:14:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have like three places in my home I work from. I am not in in a hurry. My life and my work is so leisurely. Maria and the people that I work with, I choose the same kind of vibe.
00:14:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So whatever it takes. I'll just do some stuff. Yeah, give me about five, seven minutes. I'll actually put the T kettle on too and make a cup of tea. And because I, yeah, like I, it's funny because I'm going to take my mom to the art store again soon, I was like, oh, out of artwork. So I have to find where I put it, because it was once after your meeting, it was full.
00:15:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, so give me five, 10 minutes. I'll be right back.
00:15:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

00:15:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

00:23:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let me go with going people about to telling friends about you about how awesome it was talking to you and what your notes look like when we were done.
00:23:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)

00:23:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Cool. What's like that?
00:23:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm a weirdo. I love it. love it. Let me. Oh, well, you're going to be able to see the picture. But anyways, there's one picture we didn't I remember from the last call that was the beginning as well. So we thought just doing some the audience building with some quality videos. So this thing I just sent you this on Voxer, like it was kind of the videos you see video one and then V2 for video two. So video one is just about client's day with me for nine years. So I thought that was huge. So I really just took notes of some of the kind of repeatable tuples that you say as well, but it was really too, I don't know like what I did, hey, hey, hey, no, Merlin, no, sorry. doggy. Was that a dog? Yeah, yeah, he's I don't know how well you can see it.
00:24:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There he is. Merlin. Yeah. Oh, he's so cute.
00:25:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's probably getting scared because I think there's a big thunderstorm coming our way. You know, when the heat dropped, the heat got so hot, you know, all that could be storms coming. So yeah, the wind now just picked up and yeah, anyway, yeah. then, so, anyway, so yeah, so the thoughts I had were to just start creating this kind of connection. I don't know if you want to call it a connection connection, social funnel or culture, social funnel, whatever the words out there that people use nowadays. But it's really a bottom line just creating these three to five minute videos. We're just giving good value content with no intent to sell right away, even though obviously that's what we're going to do.
00:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We're building up your invisible list, so to say, right?
00:25:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So for example, like me, Karina and I have one video. video where I scripted for her and I said, hey, just do this, like 10 reasons to trust us, right? And she's Shopify certified partner. So she kind of lists 10 reasons to trust her like, hey, I've also built a million dollar business on Shopify, still on the boutique, it's still running, all these things. it's not really like, okay, my stuff. It's more just, hey, here's 10 reasons to trust it and it shows, hey, I don't want my mom, you know, with my husband and kids and stuff. so, but funny enough, that video brings in sales. I was just looking at ads this morning and showed the purchase column and it's like, don't know exactly which thing they purchased because we have a few things. That business model is more like what we call the, do you remember the Sears catalog?
00:26:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
00:26:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And Avon catalogs.
00:26:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you remember when we opened? I'm also Avon and Tupperware and Mary Kay.
00:26:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, do. Yeah, so like, there's so many ways, as you know, to build a business that makes sales. But one of the ways that I think is like strong now, um, because of technology and social media reach and adds the way it's beneficial to videos. Anyway, like, you know, we all bought through catalogs when we're younger or my mom too, like she's Avon seller and and and Sears catalog come wait to have it come out and go buy. Do you need the Christmas catalog? Yes. And then I busted my marketing chops going through the JP Peterman catalog before the internet existed. So I would like learn from the direct sales master's back then was like, yeah, yeah, Robert Colier. I used to buy for me, be his antique books used to be a pastor and then became. Oh, wow.
00:27:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. I did Don Don happy days.
00:27:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, I'm not Don Tom Bosley's SNC.
00:27:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, okay. Don Don the pre's as like, I did my tone and everything. and Melaleuca and everything and a lot of my friends are in direct response and oh cool one of my clients is Brian Kurtz as partner so I've been working with him for six and a half years and Brian threw that as well so yeah it's it's a small world I was I was going through because I do my research and looked at all of your Facebook profile things because that's what we do it's we suck face images and I saw a picture of you with Seth Laraby. Seth sensed my sweetheart my fiance to go on the internet and be on Facebook and now we've been together for 10 years so oh my god small world how we all interact and impact each other in a professional way but in in a really personal way because I was not looking to date I was I was gone through divorce and he was um well I told God if he wanted me to be
00:29:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
with anybody you'd have to drop them on my lap. So I love it.
00:29:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love it. Yeah. I was coaching soccer and raising four girls and teaching music in Sunday school and running business. And anyway, but, but yeah, our history is amazing. I was looking at it and I saw something you did saying you've been doing this for two decades. I'm like, I've never met another woman that's been doing this this long. And then the post today about people call you like the mom of their business.
00:29:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like, I've never heard anybody else be that, but I've been that for a long time.
00:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm like, this is just like, how did it take so long to even know? That's what I'm like.
00:29:42 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But anyway, that's cool. That's cool. Yeah. Well, actually, when my dad started getting sick about three years ago, I kind of hid for a while. So I wasn't really as much. I was buying the scenes as the chief marketing officer for a couple of companies.
00:29:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But yeah, so, so yeah, going back to the catalog model.
00:29:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, we have a of my business model, because I have a percentage of her company, is more selling all the little things like this for three bucks, this for 20 bucks, this for $30 like a catalog model. So, because once they find one thing, as long as they're good quality products. And of course, you just have some mid ticket, like $500 and $4,800 high ticket. But most of the sales are driven through the low ticket. And the exit strategy, we figure for that in a couple of years is the boutique brain software, AI software that we're going to come out with in about August. But so for you, we don't know what path and since you're so open talking about it's cool, we don't know what path even God's going to have for you. But I know that if we start creating your audience, that's something cool could come or we just stick with what you already are, you know, selling. But the first step is like just spend the first month or two, sort of my cats, stairs, it's a bedroom divergent office.
00:30:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think they're just all going bananas because I'm down.
00:31:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
here.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's cuddles, but what's going on?
00:31:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, it's only 334 here and she doesn't get fed to five, but she's acting like it's five. So anyway, so one of the things that we should just do is like just like all these videos, we start creating them and then run $5 day ads to them and to find out which audiences are working and which videos kind of work better and then there's KPIs that come into place.
00:31:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, you know, many people stay watching 25% of the video?
00:31:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the cost for 25% of the video? Because like when I first started now with Ginger for about a month, it started about $0.70 to $1 for every 25% video view and different angles like Gary Vannerchuk audience, Marie Forleo, a reporter field, digital marketing, software companies, because she builds websites for people. And So, in her case, after a few weeks, we found some of the better audiences and tweaked some of the videos so that she now has more like under 50 cents video view, which is like almost a hundred percent decrease in her cost of building her video views audience. And when you, Green and I have been doing the video views for over six months, we're now down to some videos are getting like 10 cents per 25 percent video, which is really good. Yeah. every day's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So every week we can, you know, gain like about 2000 people that and they're not just watching 25 percent of the video view, then percentage of them go on and watch like 75 percent of the three to five minute video, which is priming that person then to whatever, say just to choose a simple model, like let's just open and close, Hey, the higher ticket product three days every month. So So for Kreno, we're opening and closing a thing for $500 for the next three days. because we've built up so much brand equity from the video views and value videos and I don't know the right word for it, it's not culture equity, it's not community equity, maybe it's connection equity, but like silly videos too about like 10 reasons to trust us are a little bit more about you, know, like the client stayed with me for nine years. I don't mean that silly, the word silly is the wrong name for it, but it's like not a typical direct response video where you're teaching here's right for you to double your average order value, which are good videos to have to, business, know how to, but the client's statement for nine years just build a, wow, that's a big deal.
00:33:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, a huge person of why people will say you don't keep talking to anybody that doesn't have a personality.
00:33:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have personality.
00:33:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It will come out, but if I were just to talk about the business stuff and not show my personality, which means there will be silly videos, sassy videos, things like that. It is for people to stay with you a long time, they have to have relationship. You're not going to have a relationship with anybody that is tedious to listen to. That isn't entertaining to some point, and especially that you don't feel so to feel connected to somebody near a neuron being what they are, you have to feel like they see you. How do I make people feel like they're seen through the video? Well, it is through talking about my stories, and I know you've experienced something like this, not this, and the language, the nuance of the language is really important. I have a client, I keep brow beating him with these like, nobody's doing this, nobody's ever seen this. I'm like, you're wrong about that. You haven't seen anybody else doing it, but to be so arrogant as to think that you're eight figure and I'm for your clients. I've never seen anybody do this. They're playing in a different pool than you are. First of all, they're all over the world. And I know people who are doing what you're doing. They're just not broadcasting it. They're secret weapons working silently behind the scenes. But what I'm going to tell you is the one day that somebody besides me tells you, you're not the only one doing this, like it's going to hit his ego really hard. And it's just just being mindful. Like you don't have the Lord over people. Because you know you have a powerful, potent skill. I am incredibly rare. Few people can do what I can do. But I also know there are a lot of people who can do things I can't do. I am cut off at the knees if I have to do everything by myself. Some things I can do by myself which makes me powerful. Yeah. Building my own business, I cannot do by myself because I will lose. I am a social creature. I draw energy from other people. So in serving other clients, there's always other people, but I can't do that for myself. So what good does it do to be great at business if I can't do it for myself, by myself, right?
00:36:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need people.
00:36:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And anyway, making videos and helping people see one of my, I think special talents is, and I get this from a lot of people is they'll have something in their brain for a really long time. But because they've never spoken in, and a lot of times even they've tried to, and they don't know how to, but somehow I'm able to find the words and it's usually a story or an analogy and say, it's like this, where they're like, I've never heard it put into words. And sometimes it's years that they've never heard the words spoken, they've never heard articulated, which means they've never understood it themselves, and or felt understood by somebody else. And so what I found in my years on Facebook, which has brought me all the business I could handle up till now is that even in my posting, just written text, people feel that, people feel connected to me, people will tell me a post of mind changed their lives. I have people that are making videos that have huge followings that never made a video until I did a video challenge about 11 years ago, and they made their first videos. now video is their life and their TikTok and Instagram and YouTube stuff. And I just think, I don't know how a big ego about it, but I wonder how much I showed up and people were following me and they had been following me, but silently, we weren't connected, but now I've had people send me jewelry that they made. one girl sent me a shirt that said, Team Tina on it. And I just post a little bit of stuff, so I know that. I do know how to connect with people and to the we don't know what God is going to call me to. I don't care what works or how it works. I care that I work, meaning that I shoulder to the wheel elbow grease work. Yeah, I mean, what comes out of it is always enough. I always have what I need as always taken care of. I've been poor, I've been rich, I've been everything in between and that doesn't matter. What matters is that that I'm doing the work, so I don't have a lot of attachment between the work very easy to do because the goal is serve people and I'm taking care of. It's always been like that. God has made it that way. If I will go where he wants me to go then he will. So in terms of like these videos, the picture that you sent me. these are things that I feel so okay. In terms of like what I could get from help with you and it's. also crazy too that at the same time as I found you and I'm like I really want to talk to this lady because you stand out and all the ways I told you you did. I've got these old clients that want to do work and it's a husband and wife team and their kids have watched them grow up and we work together for you here and she wants to do this because I had put together your hosting can I share my screen? Yeah absolutely and I'm just going to the the TV automatically went on down there I'm just going to go turn it off hold on just let's see you
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, back back back, here we go.
00:40:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I showed her this yesterday, whoops, apparently I'm on my keyboard. That was like this, I'm not greedy. I want to work on a profit sharing model. I mean, not just that, I'm willing to pay base pay because I'm all pizza, I get paid plus rev share. But there's also, so there's a couple things like, for example, my fiance is very wealthy, but I, I keep a very independent work of my business and the biggest reason is because I want to be able to show women what's possible when they're doing it on their own.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's been a huge thing before we get married. I'm like, I need to have accomplished a certain amount of things, not pride, it's not ego, it's evidence based.
00:41:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People listen to the people that they feel like understand and have gone through things because I've gone through a lot as a single mom. And because one of the the biggest ways to convince someone is to be like, I've done it. Yeah. So to kind of take the excuses away. Anyway, but the other thing is like, you know, in the men's world, they're ref sharing partnering, helping each other make money all the time. women are just paid. can't tell you how many millionaires I've made, Maria. Yes, I know. Well, going bankrupt, by the way, I fired a client when I had no other income.
00:42:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was, they built something called Coffee Shop Millionaire, this dude named Anthony Trister.
00:42:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, it took them two and a half years to make a product and launch it.
00:42:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
When they launched it, it's made $80,000 like in a couple of weeks, but then it goes out to $3,500 a month on ClickPink.
00:42:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so they did that two months in a row, they're like this sucks. And his partner's name was Manish. Well, I met Manish through Eric Luvier and job crusher. And because I was working on job crushers payroll for a while, right around divorce, transition time. And Manisha, hey, can you help with some tech stuff? Because I can do all this technical development. I made my bread and butter customizing WordPress themes for a while. Like I can do the copy.
00:42:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can do the graphics. can do everything.
00:42:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yep. Anyway, Um, so I came in there to help them with some, some tech stuff, some automations, but they had a developer. And the biggest thing that they did was they had created this. It was, you know, make money online activity coffee shop millionaire. He was not a millionaire. So there's integrity issues already.
00:43:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, and what Anthony did was just went around and hustled.
00:43:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He was in the affiliate market and the, you know, the mastermind circuit, all that stuff. Well, by the third month of $3,500, they had asked me, would you be our business manager?
00:43:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I would ask them questions. are you doing this? Why are you doing that? Why are doing this? Yeah.
00:43:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Finally, um, four months into working for them. So I started in March, which by the way, this is how God is. I had zero clients. I had taken my girls into homeschool because my ex was abusive.
00:43:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And I was like, if you're going to get bullied at home, you're not going to get bullied at school.
00:43:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Also, I can't at least keep you here. can watch you more. So I hadn't taken any clients. for a while. So I had no money. A week after I left, I got this job and was on payroll and was able to take care of my family. So God is so good. Anyway, this is all relative to what's happening. So this is my first time making a million dollar company in less than a year. And so took the two and a half years to make it, did their launch 3,500 a month for a few months. And then I'm like, why am I even your business manager? You should go find somebody else because you don't listen to me. You don't do any of things I tell you. You have the same conversations week after week after week and I wrote money. They get paid to hear this stupidity all the time and be forced to listen to this. I have to take care of kids.
00:44:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do it in business too.
00:44:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So they're like, fine, we will do what you say. Eight months after I started working with them, they had three other products on the market and they had broken a million dollars in sales. That was not them. partially for sure. But they were spending their rills. They didn't know how to do it. And then, are you familiar with Ryan Moran?
00:45:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:45:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, he wrote a book last year, I think, called 12 Months to a Million Dollars. It was about a company called St. Labs that I helped him build as his business manager. So they were already doing pretty well. But when I came in and I have a testimonial from his partner, I helped them 400 times what they were doing.
00:45:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. No, I remember you were mentioning that.
00:45:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, yeah. So and all it was better meetings and whatnot. But anyway, those people will profit share profit share.
00:45:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They were paying me $15 an hour, Maria. Yeah. That's the hour.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. And so then I was like, I'm no, not going to do this. Okay. So I had to do this whole quitting thing, big drama.
00:45:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They came up, okay, well, we'll you $40 an hour.
00:45:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So within a few months, I was getting paid $500 an hour, but not for from them. And then Ryan called and offered me to one third of his company, if I would come down to Austin and run it for him. He said, everybody's got their prize, Tina.
00:46:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you can't pay my Ryan.
00:46:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't hate men by any means, bags, and they can be nail and female.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And there's lots of I agree, I just don't want to work with them.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so you may or may not have any interest in this. Shando did. And she's like, I will, I will do this. This is not ownership, but it's profit sharing. I want to be able to own my content and what I create because this is my two decades of experience and things. But, and I don't know if you would have any interest in it. I, there's definitely an overlap, but there also could be multiple marketing efforts coming because I create content and you two have very different personalities. And maybe I wait and see what happens with her and if it doesn't work out see if you want to I don't know that sounds kind of do She to me, but I'm also just a Throw everything out.
00:47:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I bomb it and see what happened. Oh, yeah I mean never know until you start working with someone, you know Yeah, we want to go what would the topic of this be this product?
00:47:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So this is So I have a I've put together a We'll call it an e-book right now. It's ultimately going to be on it. I think it's a crap I think it's gonna take a long time No, that's not it. Hold on sec There's my VSL from like 12 years ago for a product I mean I called my freedom systems 20 minute VSL because that was the thing and they worked Yeah, yeah, it was crazy. Um, let me which accounts my Sorry So, so first of all, there's some, these could be trip wires, they could be free. I could do, I've got like nine different things. I think the ones that are the most powerful would be simple finance systems. This is, these are all first draft, but transform your business finances. Actually, you know what, let's go to the time one. I'll show you the time one, because I had people do you know who Tyler Ellison is?
00:48:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, probably if I saw him, I might recognize some of the stuff because he is a media buyer.
00:49:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And, matter of fact, he was the media buyer for sheer strength labs when it got started. That's Ty.
00:49:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We're cool.
00:49:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he, he's been doing stuff with the Annalene anyway, he bought my program 12 years ago and said that this time sheet homework was worth the $97 out by itself. And I had a lot of people go through it, let me see, open it up real quick. But, and I won't say nobody else does this, but this is definitely not a, everyone does this kind of thing. few people do it. So I have three primary, well, four primary principles, I would say, hold on, principles and priorities, finance, time tracking, let's see those three. The first thing is just teaching people about principles and priorities. And the reason is one of the biggest issues that people have is that in the same reason that we have people showing up to meetings and you're talking about the same thing and it didn't get done. Why didn't get done? Were you not working? Of course not. Of course I wasn't not working. I did this instead. I did this and said, well, why did you not do the thing? Because it wasn't a clear enough priority to me that I knew that that was what I had to be working on. And the reason that is is because we didn't establish values. So even when you're one person working in your own business, a lot of times people just sit. All right. What do I do today? do I need to work on? Well, if you have established that you need to work on X because X is going to give you this and Y and Z can't really be done well until X is done. Then you're very clear that X has to be done because it is, it's the cornerstone. own of everything else that you're doing. But you don't know that unless you've asked yourself what matters. Well what matters. And then you get into and almost all the time people can't tell me what does matter. What they can tell me is what they don't want. They can tell me I don't want to work after six o'clock. I don't want to deal with bad clients. I don't want to do my taxes.
00:51:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't want to do you know what I mean?
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's like types of activities, types of people, amounts of times and how much money they want to get paid.
00:51:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Those are some very clear I don't want this.
00:51:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But they can tell me what they don't want clearly without being able to confidently say but I do like people can tell me I don't want to work past three o'clock but they don't want to say I want to be done working by three. only want to work six hours a day. It's this weird thing it's almost like they haven't given themselves permission yet. So I removed that. They don't even know I've removed it. They don't care that I removed it because I'm me them say it in a way that didn't scare them by saying, I don't want this because they're good at saying what they don't want. Anyway, all of that can be done in a little product, a little seven dollar product, $20, whatever product. When they've determined that, but sometimes they can't determine that. So sometimes we have to mix it with this activity. And this is the thing that has brought people hundreds of thousands of dollars just by going through this because it's a mindset shift. So when you figure out your mostly profitable activity, I had a real estate agent, he went through this, he's like, holy crap, I'm spending my time doing whatever kind of basic stuff when really my money making comes from showing houses. So I need to get this stuff off my plate. I sometimes people just don't ask themselves what's their most profitable activity. Most people, ask themselves what their most profitable activity is. Then you think about what's the other stuff because you have to know what's there. And then when we get to the time sheet exercise, I'm going to wrap this up really fast because I'm sure you probably have another call. Time sheet exercise, a lot of times people will under predict how long it'll take. Well, it's only going to take me half an hour to write this copy. Yeah, plus six hours, something like that. You know, people tend to underestimate.
00:53:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So once we start talking, I try to do that all the time. Yes.

So but once you start to be more mindful of it, you start to be able to better engage and then you give yourself a little break and go, Oh, the reason I didn't get this done is because it takes longer than I thought it did. Yeah. So then you start to give yourself some grace and time things better. So but then a lot of times they'll plan out their work week, but they won't take into account that is gym night. Well, for me, when I go to the gym, the next day I am diminished. I don't have as much strength. and energy. I'm tired. I need like 10 hours of sleep that night instead of eight. I'm going to eat more the next day because I've left heavy weights. And so the day after needs to be calculating what's happening that day, people don't do that generally speaking. so they're just like, I'm dragging what orchestrate a day that is compatible with the activity of going to the gym the night before. Date night, a lot of times we'll energize people if they have you know, a good experience with it. And so I talk about energy sandwiches. If there's something that really sucks in your life and you have to do it, sandwich it in between the really good stuff. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, these are things that and I bought another hour so we could schedule that another time and go through it because at the very least, I would love to have your mind just say, this is what I think that you should do. This is where I think you stand out.
00:55:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's part of why.
00:55:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm talking so much because you have experience so you could say, Tina, I've never heard this where I rarely hear this. We need more of this in the world.
00:55:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think if you say that to me, I'm going to trust your expertise because you've been around a long time.
00:55:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I benefit from you specifically because of that. So my, I'll tell you all my modules if I can get to my chapters. So principles priorities start by defining what matters most.
00:55:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Simple finance systems, what comes in, or it needs to be greater than what goes out.
00:55:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Time mastery, making the most out of the hours you have, things like that. Business and project management, it's the same thing. It's teaching people the simplest, but as you can see, they build upon each other. Knowing what you want to earn and how much you want to earn starts and works best when you have your priorities and your values. Because so many people are like, I'm going to earn a million dollars by that. Why? Well, so and so did. And I'm like them. Yeah. Like, well, that's, you know, that's not gonna make you happy. Anyway, dream team, people want to hire when they have no business hiring, when they have no skill about delegating, when they don't know how to train, when they don't even know how to hire. And they want to go spend $3,000 a month when they're making $10,000 a month to hire somebody.
00:56:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't know how to lead.
00:56:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So a whole long conversation about before you do this. Here's how you do this optimally to get your money back and to increase your energy, not just your revenue, by who you bring on to your team. Optimizing iteration, scaling, which is not the same optimized, obviously is making it work the best you can scaling it is growing what's already working good. And this, I don't really hear people talking about this but sharpening your saw, whatever you're good at, keep getting good at it, keep getting better at it. They're one of the reasons I never lose clients. I won't say never lose clients, but I have it. I fired them. They haven't fired me is because when I feel a lull and they're showing up and we're having the same conversation and there's no excitement and they're like, yeah, everything's okay or everything's good. But they're not like, oh, great idea, Tina. But they don't say that to me for a little while.
00:57:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I need to go have something better for the table.
00:57:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But also I become happier because I'm investing in myself and I'm learning more like working on my psychology degree so I can understand how the brains work better and how my people work better and things like that, including my own children, finding your heart. We lose people, we lose pets, we lose spouses, we lose parents, we lose kids. If we don't fortify our brains and our hearts and our spirits, like filling them up with good books, good stories, good understanding. underdog stories, especially things like that, then when things go bad, we don't have anything in the tank to go and help us through this. But it's inevitable that a human will go through this. That human that's running a business is going to take their business with it. And all the people that rely on them and work for them and the families that rely on their parents who work there. So I just want to fortify the people that lead and the businesses that they lead. And this is what I'm doing. But all of this is segmentable and iteratable, which means there is a tiny portion that I can give away, a tiny portion I could sell at the next level. There is an ascension in all of these. How a person who's making zero money applies this is going to be different than how a person who's making $10 million a year applies this. It's going to be different than how somebody making $100 million a year applies this. But all of these principles will apply.
00:59:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does that make sense? It does, it does.
00:59:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like, how does this work? There is a personal story in anecdote several and infinite really for all of these in terms of stories content creation of my own of other people calling in other creators and collaborating with them. This is a this is a community thing like we all need these things we all have had these issues and nobody is ever mastering all these things at all times. No. So, this is timeless. I'm not the expert in all of it, but what I bring to the table is the depth of the conversation so that you and your own skill and your own talent and you talking about these things with the brains around you and the hearts around you are going to be better and going to be four to five for your whatever investment in this is going to pay you back over and over again. I'm confident about that.
01:00:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's the example Jack's 90-day plan?
01:00:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Whoa, where are we at?
01:00:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, on the left-hand side, I'm looking in the table of contents, yeah.
01:00:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's realigning his actions with his vision values. Jack set a goal to increase his digital marketing agency's client by 15% over the next 90 days. Using the smart framework, Jack made his goal specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. He then created a 90-day plan to break this goal into actionable steps, so I actually have like a 90-day roadmap of these are the things that we're going to do. But they're not, that is a pace, and it wasn't actually Jack, it was Dan, between you and me. But the pace is very specific to the person and what happens most of the time, is people get overzealous in the pace, and they're mad that they don't get there, and then they feel like they feel feel feel. And worse, they feel like their team has failed, and then whole thing. Dan is very laid back, so this is much slower. This tends to happen over a year, but we did create the 90-day roadmap, kind of working off of Aaron Fletcher's stuff, but it was already things that we were doing. He's like, Tina, you already have this.
01:01:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You already have this.
01:01:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, But we don't have it written down. Anyway, Dan is one of my biggest fans who's never made a testimony.
01:01:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He's like, I'm not that dude. I'm like, I know it's okay. I was just curious, it's kind of a big deal, too, the 90-day goal setting, creating a 90-day plan. 90. And the other thing that intrigued me is the scaling your business is hot, as you know right now. Hot trend, hot words over productivity, but the productivity time is powerful, but often is the vitamin that you put into the program, and I know you know these things, but... Yeah.
01:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm. Sell them what they want.
01:02:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them what they need. Yeah.
01:02:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
them painkillers because that's what they want.
01:02:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give them vitamins. Yeah. So, yeah, cause I know a friend of mine just bought someone's course and she's going to stop the monthly because it was like no contracts. It was like 300 bucks a month. But she's intrigued by it because the promise was, you know, get a hundred K months. Line with your heart and stuff. But once you got in, she kind of, cause she's already, already wasn't Taki Moore's black belt program. I'll go because a lot of it was all just that. But the interesting part is that he sold her what she wanted. The hundred K and result goal. But once you got in, a lot of it was, which is just important, but she already knew it. As a line in your, your business around the life that you want, run your values so that you don't create a monster of a business that you want out of. That's all synopsis, right? But he led with the hundred K months, but. Yeah. once the 90 day roadmap or something that's always really hot even when I do surveys to people.
01:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes so this this the thing is I usually custom customize this them for people and the other biggest problem is that usually this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being 90 days this 30 days ends up being it depends on the person and how much they show up but generally really there's a whole lot of resistance that happens in here a whole lot of um executive dysfunction yeah I know I need to define this I know I need to crunch the numbers I know I need to ask myself these questions but what happens is is they think about everything that's attached to that question of why am I here after I've been doing this for 10 years they start asking themselves other questions which overwhelm them depress them cause them anxiety and make them want to bury their heads so they do don't do this until they get back on the call and I drag it out of them on a call which is one of the reasons a lot of this stuff doesn't work without coaching because the thing that's stopping you is your own mental stuff and there's nobody there to extract you from your stuff and your stuff from you. It's a huge part of the work and if somebody doesn't have the mental fortitude to do that on their own they're going to continue to spin their wheels until they get somebody to help them. Yeah. That's what's hard and nobody wants to hear that but there's enough people I can sell this to who have been doing this enough that they know that they're in their own way. Yeah. And that they know there is no diet pill that actually will give you the body that you want. Yeah. have to do diet, you have to do exercise. I only want to talk to people who are not trying to buy lottery tickets.
01:05:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
diet pills anymore. There's a lot of tickets and diet pills. You haven't got where you need to be to talk to me. I've already got them for you as well.
01:05:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I stay it all the time.
01:05:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I get some diet.
01:05:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, right? You want the easy way to riches, you want the easy way to health and it doesn't exist. Now, there is an optimized way, there's a leveraged way, but there is not an easy way. Simple, not easy.
01:05:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How does this phrase resonate with you?
01:05:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Leveraged I recall it leveraged abundance because riches to me puts a very specific connotation of money. I also don't want to deal with FTC, but abundance is a whole different kind of thing. When I think about even the. for I had a lot of money, I had a lot of wealth, the kind of freedom I had over my life and the relationships I had with my kids, with myself, with God, with my, that was, that was exceptional, even then. It led to the money. So leveraged, leveraged abundance or leveraged wealth, even.
01:06:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But yeah, I like abundance. I like wealth. Don't get me wrong, but there's already, I'm trying to sort of kind of also as you're talking, think of how you can be a category of one as well, like from a branding perspective. Yeah, because in these videos too, like, like typically after the I've been, you know, I've helped create, you know, multi-million dollar companies or sold company in 18 months for a million dollars. Like, I'd say some accolades, right and for you and then you can create.
01:07:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I can help you with this. I don't know anyone else that was a single mom of four kids who works less than 20 hours a week making six figures growing million dollar businesses for my clients and still having time to coach soccer. I've never met anybody else that could do that.
01:07:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So so so you're you're yeah like you could be known as that I like that yeah that would be it and then also maybe like you're you're known as like leveraged abundance is sort of the portfolio of products that you have or something. I was just trying to think of it.
01:07:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Abundance has its connotation to you. It is what my stressed out anymore. I had one question. client who showed up and he went to all these masterminds and he spent so much money. And he's he's in the guru network. And he's like, I always show up to calls ready to be beat up and I'm intimidated and I'm anxious. And he says, I just feel you love love. Now I beat him up. Yeah, beat him up. I called him out every time I said that , you shouldn't do this that you should not be doing that. No, you should do not. He's like that hurts. He goes but I still feel love and I feel anxious. And and he had peace and he told me that I made him a better father and a better husband.
01:08:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But I was here for work in business.
01:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's video on my wall somewhere about it that that he left me. And and when my dad's are like, I'm picking up my kids and I'm taking naps and I'm less it's less stress. They're happier. They're less stressful. They're busy. this are growing, I really have, know, people will say, double your income, cut your time in half. I've done that with people over and over again, but that's not the best part. The best part is they were happier, they were less stressed, they liked who they were working with. And so the thing that I tell people is, where do I have it? But it's, I have to sustainable growth and the business that you love. Where the heck? I have an Etsy store too, so I'm good. That's my fun thing. That'll do it right there, I think. Maximized profits, streamline operations, love your business. That's the big thing right there. Whoa, not going to be happy. If you're stressed, you're not going to be happy. If you're broke, you're not going to be happy. If you're hustling and grinding and chasing everything, you can't be unless you're leveraged and optimized. You're not going to love your business. Most people don't love their business. I do.
01:10:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would do this for free if I didn't need money.
01:10:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I still do it. I've done it. I do it for free.
01:10:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've got clients I work for for free.
01:10:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Now, that I've worked with for over a year, because that's how much I love what I do. And that's also very unique. Not a lot of people can say that.
01:10:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I don't know what the hook is. I've never known what it is. So many times people try to tell me, ask me, Tina, tell me what you do. I'm like, I do so many different things. It's really more relative to you, which is not a great answer. So to tell you what I have to do, I have to know what you do.
01:10:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I could tell you what it would be helpful, blah, blah, blah, blah, Got you, got you, got you. That's where I started. I go, Maria, no, but I do like all the thoughts, leverage and optimize happy leaders, double your income time and half. Yeah, because, because when you show me that spreadsheet earlier, like the, the other one with the financial performance and stuff, seven dollar to a Facebook ads, like a productivity kind of product working that well, you know, unless I'm just having to.
01:11:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't really think Facebook is the place for me. think you too. And talk would probably be ideal. And I think that whatever I do on one, I'll duplicate on the other, maybe with a tiny tweak, according to that platform and probably Instagram because they're very similar. But my priority would be to talk in YouTube because I think that they have the most leverage compensation opportunity. I think that my personality will do very well on both of those platforms to get people to help me come out of my shell enough to do it. I've really struggled with that because I'm making claims and I am very private and YouTube is not private.
01:12:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All your neighbors see everything.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This has been a very separate world from the rest of my life. Nobody knows what I do. There's been a lot of resistance to that, but anyway, I think YouTube and TikTok have a lot of these types of things, actually, and I think that they could do very well. I think at least the first two could do really well. I think the group membership from what I've been seeing, I don't know about that price point, but the great thing is about this, so suggest change to something and let me show you, it's a formula.
01:13:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Our offer, we've been doing really well with filling out $3, and then you'll end up getting 20% conversion rate. It's a change of $3 to $20, which is insane.
01:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so look how fast that changed, but let's reduce these then. Let's change this to $67, instead of $9.97, and that's still a very healthy margin. And let's just say nobody bought that.
01:13:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And the 20 should become 17 if that were to be an order bump, because we've tested 19, 20 versus 17, 17, magic number. think it's because 17 plus three is 20. So when people see that, they're okay with 20, but they're not okay with 22. That's weird.
01:13:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I think groups do better when there's a ton of people in there. And if I have to hire help, I'm really good at hiring. I have a whole huge talent pool I could tap into, and if it's making that amount of money, I get multiple people. to come in and help because a huge part of what I want to do, Mariette, give more jobs.
01:14:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to be a job creator for women.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anything else that you would play around with in here?
01:14:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So the book, Digital PDF, that is $20 price per unit.
01:14:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Change that to $17.
01:14:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then is that going to be like an order bump in a funnel?
01:14:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that what your vision is? go ahead.
01:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Change the conversion rate from 17% to 45%. That's what we're getting right now in our $3 funnel. Conversion rate on the three buck offers between 20 and 30%.
01:14:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm being conservative. How many eyeballs are you getting on these offers?
01:14:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me share a screen.
01:14:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, you OK?
01:15:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Questions? Yeah. Because we're using with like Facebook ads, so it's often hard to scale. Do you follow Maria Wentz stuff, by the way?
01:15:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I feel like I know the name.
01:15:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, she says a lot of low ticket stuff, having the catalog model, right? Seers catalog game on catalog, you know? But she came up with this. I'm not buying it, but I always see what people are offering and the business coach on Demento, but it's all sheets, level one, level two. What custom business advice on what you should be doing based on what you want. Here's your input, calculate your monthly sales goal, cost the business coach on the mail, spit out custom checklists for you. Like I was like, holy cow. And then she's linking, I think, to the actual thing. she's charged with January seven, but again, I'm not going to buy, I'm just curious. She's always launching some interesting thing, but see level one, getting your first 1k, level two, your first 5k.
01:15:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought that was brilliant. I've never seen anyone do that. Yeah.
01:15:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've not seen that either. Yeah, I'll show you the link and it's funny because. years ago, I was thinking of, oh, you know, when someone buys our product, I should have three different levels that, okay, level one, go here to this training level two, but yeah, and that's something I've been trying to figure out, like, how do I segment because all of these are universal for everybody, but they are applied differently when you're in a different place. Yeah, yeah, I love that. So there, so I just I just shot that over to you there in the zoom chat, but yeah, let me log in to click funnels. So because I want to bring up the stats specifically for the three dollar thing. Now our account will never show the stats for the high ticket stuff or 500 stuff because that's through directly through Stripe. And so, whoops, well, I'll drop sets there so you can see here as well. Okay, slow to me. comes up and okay so let's we're just gonna go just go back here for example my filter so that's going take a while so let me just pull up another click button let me pull up the the thing we just launched last week and we're slowly scaling it this is the three-dollar one that surprised us because we're getting like like crazy um conversions on it remember 29 I can't remember whether we launched it on the 28th front after the 30th so I'll just go here my filter so this one's now so this we're going to push the system i.o. maybe because click panels keeps Come here. So, well, I'll just show this to you. So, this is just like a week or like maybe six days of running some ads. And again, it's not including if they buy the $500 thing or they call them by 4,800 high ticket thing. But anyways, this is showing 275 unique people coming to the page. So, I know it's not a lot right now. It's been running for like six days. The option rate click phones is showing clearly wrong stats because I can't believe it up 92%. But we were running at 80%, which was crazy. That's like the initiate checkout. Because again, it's only $3.
01:18:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
01:18:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
what's is that 73 people bought. So 73 divided by like say take the 229 number, it's showing 31%. So that's insane because when I come over here. And gosh, I wish I could just pull up a whole years here because I'll show you over 100 grand from the this funnel, and again, not including the $4,800 group coaching up sale. Let's just go to April, because to go order magnitude, this will only convert in as $20 the front end. It will only convert at 3%, you know, something around there. Come on, when it's not pre-framed with the $3 offer, like when it's the front end or what? Yeah, is a different funnel that's $2, and this is the funnel, and I'll show you what it looks like online. There we go. So this is the $3 one here. So all it is is just a simple three-minute video, simple headline, a slow headline. This one little testimonial reel, two minutes of just variety of testimonials. Oh. Just ahead. So yeah, um, and then this like We're going back to really because everyone's attention is like pulled in different directions This is like what's converting well now because you see the numbers just initial this is cool traffic. isn't warm traffic Um, so it's insane. That's everything we're buying. So we are now just playing around with the order bump so 38 of bought the order bump which was 19 we brought it down to 17. So we're having better conversions when it's 17 And then these conversions are not bad So we're happy with this even though the average order value kind of sucks when you Sort of look at it But knowing that we have a $500 thing and a $4,800 thing that we sell them within 30 days that customers Average order value blended will be a lot higher So if I just have a different idea and it I know i'm interrupting I'm going for 80d rain.
01:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will I've been trying I'm to hold it for a long time, like a whole 60 seconds.
01:21:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a really long time for my brain.
01:21:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, I am annoying because this is, I'm a five-year-old in a lot of ways. I am like the kid on the playground that goes, do you want to be my friend? And like, do you want to come play with me? Um, I've never met anybody like you.
01:21:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I want to play with you.
01:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, what if we created something together and combined our skills and knowledge and expertise?
01:21:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't know this thing because this wants to be worth out of me. It doesn't matter if it's a parallel and it doesn't matter if they're very similar.
01:21:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't believe in their competing because I think that the people that would be drawn to my individual energy are not the same that would be drawn to our combined energy.
01:21:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And even if they are, also, I just don't believe in competition. I don't believe that it's harmful.
01:21:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I believe in abundance.
01:21:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I believe that. the more effort we put in, the more magic we make, the more magic we use to do things in the world. But what if we just combined things and created something together, we could split the work, it could be a partnership. I don't know you. That's not appropriate.
01:22:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's not wise business.
01:22:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I just feel something very kismet, very sadistic about this. I'm getting very emotional. I really get frustrated at that. But what if you just sit and just think about that? mean, I've got another hour that we can come back, well, half an hour because I respect your time, and we've gone over.
01:22:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
took about 10 minutes making my tea and get my book, so don't worry. We'll just do another hour. the answer straight up is, yeah, I would like to seriously consider that because I think it would be fun, first of all.
01:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need fun and I need more conversations Maria and I need more women. I don't not have them. It's just not enough. Like I am trying to really fill myself up but also I'm trying to fill up other women too. Yeah. the more that you talk the more I'm just like, I, I bore you already.
01:23:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love you already.
01:23:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'm just okay.
01:23:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, just real quick, just to kind of like close one. No, no, no, it's okay. So, so you can see from this, like the average hour, this is the one that starts at $20. This one only has a 2.73% conversion rate. So, but the average car value is 104. Like we have that dialed in. But this one, once we can dial it in because it's only been working for a week now. Like this is just the last two days. you can see that we've already dialed in like like the order bump is 27%. We're like a little bit higher. But but still like it's a crazy bananas conversion.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 32%.
01:24:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, you know, but but because the convergence so much higher, the cost per purchase on Facebook is 15 bucks. So we're breaking even the first two days, we actually made bunch of money, but I think warm traffic was there. And that's why a lot of them were buying all these upsells, downsells. But it was crazy. But anyway, to make a long story short, yeah, I think whatever the thing is that we create together, we create we charge three bucks, make a $17 order bump, and then just figure out, you know, what, what the, you know, other things we sell them to make it profitable.
01:24:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And the other thing is that you're already showing up, you're doing the video, you're talking. The thing that I'm lacking most is the conversations in my life. And is that I don't want to sound arrogant because I actually get very cringy about this. But I can't tell you how many people were like, you should write a book, you should have a podcast, you should be on video, people need more.
01:25:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
for you.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could listen to you read the phone book. It's the weirdest thing.
01:25:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know.
01:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
get people are drawn to me. But I in it. But I get fed from them. It's not a I gotta give everything to the world. Yeah, I need that. I can't pour from an empty cup and I'm doing a lot of pouring. And I need to be filled up. But I get filled up by serving. And I think that your personality plus your brains plus your work plus your skills would be amazing. And I think I could match you and I bet you're not matched very often.
01:25:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No. Yeah, yeah, I think I think the match was and he sort of had heart condition. So we aren't able to do a lot of stuff with us. Seven years was Carlos Navarro. He was the guy that's the chief technology officer he was for Nobel Networks. He was one of the original guys there.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you may have heard his name before, but he's brilliant tech or known him and friends with them. But I haven't seen him for
01:26:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Exactly, yeah, he went he they almost recruited me, but I didn't want to move to South Korea The emotional intelligence software that we created about more than 12 years ago and Google's Eric Schmidt chairman of Google invested in it We sold that off to a Korean company that is now using it in hospitals for dementia patients And he became the CTO and moved to Korea and that was about five seven years ago because they wanted to recruit me too But I said no, I can't leave my family my parents and stuff But he didn't have serious heart issues, so he's really just Moved away from from being public the last year went back in health and he now is a little bit more in public, but yeah, he Yeah, so anyway, but yeah, that's only one match with but on that note, you're right I do have 430 call though now, but yeah, you have the link right just book again with me and yes We'll go You

00:02:00 - Dan Ryan
They started attacking Mark's site like two days ago. They started attacking another site like within the last week. And that's on top of like we've had these carding attacks going on for close to a month. And so we fixed like the carding attack issue, which took a while. And then all of a sudden they're like, hey, yesterday they're like, sweet love's getting hammered. It's like, come on. What are you talking about?
00:02:36 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not anything good for them to hammer on our site.
00:02:38 - Dan Ryan
It's not like it's an e-commerce site. Yeah, I don't know why. The other ones I understood, yours, I don't understand. And yours, they're trying to, they're trying to get into the admin specifically. So they were specifically attacking the WordPress login.
00:02:52 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Nice.
00:02:54 - Dan Ryan
But since cloud players have been set up, 19 attacks have been stopped. Wow. In less than 21. for hours. So I'm pretty sure because someone had a successful trading attack on one of the sites, and we started getting all these people going, why is this? But what they did was, it was a very sneaky, I've never seen them do this. They did zero dollar transactions. So all they were doing was proving the car was real, and then they were going to probably go use it somewhere else. And we started getting emails from people like, who are you? like, what are you talking about? So I think our IPs or whatever got put on some sort of hacker forum, and then the onslaught started.
00:03:39 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, hosting guys are loving it. We're weird, weird target.
00:03:45 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, totally. It's, yeah, I don't know why they would go, the WooCommerce sites made sense, or so it doesn't make sense.
00:03:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that is so weird. Lidify numbers. Hold on a second. Let me just go look at this because we were talking about updating the report. So can we start there if there's any updates in the new dashboards?
00:04:16 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I mean, he pushed updates to the dashboards and then. He sent me no. What's Talking about it. Stacey had COVID.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So she was a.
00:04:35 - Dan Ryan
out for a week. Oh, yeah, he's so nerdy.
00:04:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like.
00:04:43 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, now I'm like, hey, let's come back to me. So he switched the thing to using resolution data. said that would work, but first he has to explain how it's in the wrong place. Okay. It's in case you want And that was a child object, and I guess that's sad, I don't know. But that's now in the dashboard. As a parent of the policy limits thing is now set up. And we have to look at that. He said he made some assumptions that expenses and damn business and liens are what we're looking for in terms of what would be hitting the policy limit. Is that correct? Yeah, okay. And then the report is only against defendant insurance single person policy limit. And he said, as I'm not sure what the rules of policy limits stacking are in marks various operating states differentiates from state to state. Unfortunately, he did say he knows his . Yeah.
00:05:57 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So Washington, it's sometimes Arizona, it's sometimes, most of time. New Mexico, it's where...
00:06:08 - Dan Ryan
How do we, is there a way to deal with that or not?
00:06:12 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
can check the box for policy limit or not, because it's going to be tied to the resolution tab.
00:06:18 - Dan Ryan
Okay. That box exists? Yes. Okay. I'll let him know.
00:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's it? I feel like this report changed a whole lot. And, uh, because, well, let me just go. So, DD intake, DD matters. Let me see which one I'm looking at. Okay. That's never mind. I was looking at intake and I wanted to look at matters. So, when I spoke with Lorenz and Patrick yesterday, I had some questions about things I wanted to put in a report. But I take terrible notes. So one of the things I want to know is I would really like to see, and I know that you, we can't really change this because you pretty much have to take all the cases, but I would be interested to see anyway, what the matters look like by insurance companies, in terms of volume, in terms of how long they take to close, and percentage of policy limits, especially after the way they discussed state farm. Just so that, like even if we can to say, okay, we're not taking state farm cases, obviously we can't do that, but we might be able to find ways to improve processes, improve, let's say, state farm cases take, you know, and on average, a month or two longer to resolve than I other cases, or let's say Geico just blows everybody else out of the water, like, maybe we could find some commonalities in the processes, maybe we could find better ways to improve how we deal with those specific insurance companies in order to get better results. Even again, if it's a 10% lift here or a 2% lift there, everything that we do to improve our operations, improves our operations and leverage. And the other thing is, if everybody's on the same page about it, like, Lorenz felt like it was just him dealing with it for the most part. And he had a slow Q1, and that's really been hurting him, like, in his head, like he's been in his head about it. And I'm like, I have to go back and look at everybody else's numbers, but I know that Q1 kind of slows down for all the sweet lot in terms of... Cases that we get, I don't know what it does to attorney fees if it slows things down there, but what I told them is that there there's a dip for all of Sweet Long Q1 anyway. They really just looked at it.
00:09:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, there's not.
00:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:09:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
we usually are one of our better money in months because December, they don't like to send the checks. like to hold them until January.
00:09:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So all of this makes me know at least what I need to dig into better so that I know what I'm actually talking about by the attorneys, by the overall fees and everybody's performance. The other thing is, okay, so we have dropouts and subs by team, but we don't have that in comparison to total at like as a percentage of total cases. So I would like that because there's no, so are you either if you're looking at, let a fire, I could just share my screen, let me share my screen. Yeah, I'm a little far right now, but yeah, I, yeah, so I would like to see this as a percentage of active matters or because this is, this is by time period, right? So this is for the year, this is how many dropped out and how many subouts that they have. And like Lorenz's number is five in Samantha's 12 or 13, but she's got way more cases. I know that. So I have no relationship to, you know, this is by the volume of cases that she has. So looking at this, it would make it look like he's doing better, but percentage wise, they're probably pretty close. I don't know that she's got twice as many cases as him, but she definitely has more. So anyway, Dan, is that something that you could ask for, is that this could be be in relationship to total matters.
00:11:06 - Dan Ryan
Oh, it's over. It's a right now. It's just showing total drops and subs.
00:11:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:11:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
What's that? You want to hear it?
00:11:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The year is it's this year's.
00:11:18 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So, yeah, then it should be able to just overlay number of matters created this year.
00:11:26 - Dan Ryan
Uh, yeah, biotraming.
00:11:29 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, yeah.
00:11:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just ask, is asking you to get that done enough or do I need to ask you a task for that?
00:11:42 - Dan Ryan
This is the one that sent everything to Josh. So she, you sent it to her and then if she has questions, she asks me. Um, and then her and Josh go back and forth.
00:11:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is dropouts inside by team. I feel like percentage against matters. So and then Mark, would you have any interest and is it possible? Do you track and litify what insurance company the matters are assigned to it? Yeah. So would you be interested in looking at a breakdown of those cases?
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Sorry, let me take that back. The names are in there but it's not like a drop down. on picklist. I don't know if we'll be able to filter it, because it definitely says like State Farm or Skyco or whatever else, but it's not from like a picklist.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I mean, I wish we could use that AI like the I know we're on the beta list for it. So maybe it's something we could do in the future. But for right now, could we create it? Could we create that and on the processes side, knowing that, hey, these are the same issues that we all run into, trying to deal with State Farm, like is there anything that we can do to improve that process? Whatever, can we capture some best practices of what we observe is happening with other insurance companies?
00:13:53 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I don't know, we don't know what we can do this. Honestly, I don't think it's going to make a large difference to be framed with you.
00:14:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think It'll be a large difference. I do think that the whole path to optimization is little different from just here and there.
00:14:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah.
00:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you? So, you know, if you're not interested in it, that's fine. I think it will be more about helping the team learn some things, even if they can see the numbers and go, okay, I'm not crazy. And this really does have this big of an impact. And just being able to help them visualize and go, you know, this, this, your experience is not unique. It's across the board and, but from there, if there's a bright spot, for example, and that this goes back to the book switch, which I had, I don't remember, actually I had Fuji read that one, but anyway, where sometimes by the way, just FYO. He does, yay. He's awesome. And they're gonna have a baby Monday.
00:15:03 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I'm so excited.
00:15:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If Mark referred me to a doctor friend of his.
00:15:10 - Dan Ryan
Oh, right. Yeah, you told me that.
00:15:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:15:13 - Dan Ryan
all coming back to me.
00:15:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm right. Anyway, um, anyway, so the point is that sometimes little things stick out and like we might notice that somehow one of your team members does better with with one particular insurance company than everybody else does. And so we wouldn't we wouldn't know that because we look at the report and it may just be like, Hey, this is just how we do business and they might have found a solution that they're not even aware is a solution, but it shows up in the reports consistently that they do better on this particular type of thing. So that's the whole thing about tracking all the data points that we can identify. And then looking at them and going, why. is that different? You know what I mean? So for the amount of effort that it would take to create the drop down list and then to select things, that's not really significant in terms of workload and for us to look at the data is not very significant. But let's say it just makes a little bit of improvement or let's say that it's a mental improvement for your team just going, yeah, this is what we think it is. It's not just me. That's significant. That improves morale. That gets people out of their heads and that helps them, you know, free up their mental energy for just doing their work instead of sitting there feeling bad about some of the stuff that's not going well. Does that make sense? So on whose end, who would set this up so that we can have a drop down menu and let if I for your team to start tracking what the insurance company is that we can put this into a report. probably I think because we'll have all the big ones and then we'll just have one that just says other because there's a lot of just one offs if you will like some go with which is Hyundai Japan we've got like two cases over the last three years from then like not enough to create a drop down um the drop down I see is like you know again psycho mercury infinity usa like the big ones okay cool and then um uh whatever it's called something I'm saying AI if and won't get there scratch um just see the retro actively if possible right so let me just see if there was anything else that I wanted to look at in here Can we sort it, let's see. I got that. All right, that was it for report updates based off of talking to the guys. So, um, how many cases did you have? I didn't look at that for July so far.
00:18:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, we actually read 22.
00:18:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What? Yeah. You're kidding me. That is wild. That's cool. Uh, unexpected.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan
Unexpected. for, especially going into a holiday weekend. Yeah.
00:18:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:18:57 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
little fresh rate has got subbed up by sweet James. 20 minutes after HQ intake sent us the signed agreement.
00:19:04 - Dan Ryan
Wow.
00:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:19:06 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Wow. Wow.
00:19:08 - Dan Ryan
Wow.
00:19:09 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Wow. My guest is trying to sign up and then went to like search for us to call and had sweet James. So. I really need to make sure that we are owning the PPC for sweet loss, sweet attorneys, we lawyers. Sweet law firm.
00:19:33 - Dan Ryan
Oh, my God. Are you sure? I mean, you're pretty sure that's what You signed up and then was like, Oh, I need to ask him a question or something.
00:19:55 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And then tried to call back because as we kept calling and texting us follow up, she texted Yes. My law firm is sweet Jane is please stop calling me. And so I texted her to Denise over there. I'm like, Hey, is this a client of yours? You know, sometimes clients think we're sweet James or whatever.
00:20:12 - Dan Ryan
Yeah.
00:20:14 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And they're like, yeah, she signed yesterday. I'm like, what time she she signed with us at 3 11 p.m. And she's like 3 33 p.m. So like the timing is just too tight for it to be much anything else.
00:20:27 - Dan Ryan
Sure.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was she just not just confused? Like she thought she signed up with them, but really she signed with you.
00:20:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
She signed her a dinner with sweet James. Oh, she did. OK, later though, correct. So she signed with us first. Yeah. So that's why I'm thinking that she must have been gooling online to like call or get some started or to ask a question and then come to James instead. Because the time is just too close for it to be. Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.
00:20:57 - Dan Ryan
I don't know if someone's somewhere ready to feel comfortable.
00:20:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So now I'm going to call someone else. That's weird.
00:21:02 - Dan Ryan
That is super weird.
00:21:06 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I don't So, yeah, enough about that one.
00:21:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Washington, man.
00:21:12 - Dan Ryan
Also not thrilled that those guys did basically talk to her out of staying with you because they had to. But that's unsurprising.
00:21:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I thought we kind of had the gentleman's agreement about this, but yeah, it also sounded like she didn't mention that she'd sign anything with anything. So maybe.
00:21:31 - Dan Ryan
Oh my God, these people are so stupid.
00:21:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
My friend, the business is built on people doing stupid things.
00:21:39 - Dan Ryan
No, no. They make you wonder why I didn't why didn't she think she signed anything is it makes me wonder like. What is the HQ sign up process like are they texting her and he signed like. His system is so . And the dude will not respond to me like I'm about to send a new. email, just so you know, I was waiting to talk to you. I'm going to send an email to you and him saying, I think you should just leave quantify with them and move everything else. Because I swear to you, I go in and I'm like, those are the same exact notes, you are not calling these people. But I can't say that explicitly. I did kind of intimate that.
00:22:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And last thing I dropped down that they're just picking from a checklist on the note.
00:22:29 - Dan Ryan
No, it's not. Definitely not.
00:22:31 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not there.
00:22:32 - Dan Ryan
They're too weird. Like the notes are very specifically non-specific.
00:22:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
can pull value over. not a problem. can stop that.
00:22:44 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. And then it's like, we could just just leave like you were saying leave them with quantifies because I met with the ad certainly guys. that guy just he just opened the air table of all their clients and just was scrolling through showing me. And I do still think That his Washington guy is that because he's multi state that they're signing cases and subbing and sending them out and I also think that they have to be signing just bad cases. And then these guys are never going to hear her. Oh yeah, we ended up just totally tossing that right. So that's hard to why their results are so good but literally dude.
00:23:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Or within the span of a week. That's a $56.
00:23:31 - Dan Ryan
Right. But then the span of a week, the other firm, whoever they are, I haven't been able to figure out who it is. Sign two passenger band cases in Washington. I'm like, where are those? dude, really? he walked me through their follow up system is like. Literally three calls in the first hour. Like he's like, it's, they're so aggressive, but, and then it seems to tie to their. results. So he's super duper motivated to like, I want this to work. He's like, I want sweet lot to just stick around. I want you guys to be like a long-term client. So I'm thinking like if we take their leads and then alter the follow up just for them, right? So create a laboratory around ad-serbly. Here's what we know, their leads to convert. The first round they ended up getting the lower one of the lowest cost per retainers. I think ever that since we've been testing vendors, they're super communicative, they're super data-driven, totally show everything except their websites. He actually, he's the one that I was like, you know what that quantifies doing. He's like, yeah, this is their site. So it's super sketchy, by the way, but maybe I shouldn't tell you so I won't. And then you don't know. Okay.
00:25:01 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
When you say super sketchy, like they're fitting on other people's names, that's going to create a lawsuit for me sketchy.
00:25:11 - Dan Ryan
Create a lawsuit for you. I'm not going to say that that's what they're doing. Would something like that create a lawsuit for you?
00:25:17 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not you doing it. Potentially. So Google, Quintessa marketing.
00:25:23 - Dan Ryan
Yeah, I know who they are. Yeah.
00:25:25 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. That's why we don't use Quintessa.
00:25:27 - Dan Ryan
So their entire strategy is that. And not only is that their entire strategy. Injury.com is.
00:25:39 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So that makes sense more why the Sweet James thing happened with Quantify. She may have been looking for Sweet James all along.
00:25:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:25:51 - Dan Ryan
So who's injury.com?
00:25:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I think that's Morgan.
00:25:58 - Dan Ryan
Yeah. Look it up. It's somebody big. It is... It's an injury and Morgan and Morgan. Yeah, so I thought it was Morgan. Oh, it's an interesting sight. does not look like a lawyer's sight. Their domain is not injury.com. It's lowercase L N G U R Y dot com. And I'm like, wow. Okay. Creative. That's super creative. And so they're using LINGERY dot com. guess that's a word. And then they do competitor to targeting. Because I ran them through a harass. And I looked at all the keywords that they're buying. And there's a couple. There's a couple that you can't say for sure. They're getting the leads from competitor to targeting. They're also going after some. I mean, I would say they're low volume keywords, but. Yeah.
00:26:58 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That is what they're talking about.
00:26:59 - Dan Ryan
Injured. of course. And they're not like ripping off the website, their website's ugly as well, get out. And they have the most convoluted form. I'm like, I cannot believe they actually get leads, but they obviously they do. Totally. mean, it's working. So competitor targeting works, brand competitor targeting. Quintessa, they're on this guy probably worked at Quintessa what you're going to find out.
00:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
have a question. If you guys are done with that topic, but if you're not, I'll wait. Okay, so this is resolutions by teams by month, but the report is pulled according to that date at the top. is this just mislabeled?
00:27:54 - Dan Ryan
Yeah.
00:27:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
copy. And this one is well, Yeah, it should be that if you adjusted the time, then you know, right, do you need that? Okay, so, um, so I'm going do the report. What the crap just happened? I don't know what just happened. Okay. Um, what's it called? I think it's because I pieced it in it. Resolution 13 by month. So, is there Is there any difference in significance? Because this is the case as close as we've done our part, this is when we get paid, right? Close versus resolution.
00:29:10 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Correct.
00:29:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so is resolution even something relevant on a biotin kind of thing today? Okay, and which of these do you think is more valuable? Are they the same in terms of tracking?
00:29:27 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
If have to pick one, close is more important, but the factors in the legal team is how many cases did you settle?
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because once you settle it, we know money's coming in.
00:29:40 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. And then obviously, did it come in because we have to have cash flow?
00:29:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, okay, so this is just interesting, just digging into this a little bit. Um, the case is close. I don't, I don't know. how to value this because of so many different factors and how long the cases stay open. So could we talk about that a little bit so that I can understand it better? Like if you look at this, what do you think about it?
00:30:21 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, this makes sense to me. The resolutions are usually hard when cases closed.
00:30:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean like Lorenz versus Samantha or Tyler even. Do you want to see this compared to last year? This is this year because there's a big change. I just find it interesting, but I don't. know how to weigh it. What I would like to see is the average length of time. It takes to close the case by team also. But again, report on that.
00:31:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So we should be able to add it to this.
00:31:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. Okay. any thoughts. So this again, this is last year. Lauren's had 155 for the whole year and Sam had 2001 or 2001 Tyler 174. I'm really going to look at anybody else. then this year, Lorenz is at 125 Sam 120, Tyler 109. So Tyler's kind of like keeping right behind Samantha, which is what was doing. But does this say anything to you about Lorenz's performance?
00:32:22 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
That he's dragging on getting some cases resolved, because look, he's only settled 120, but he somehow paid out 125.
00:32:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, is that not the other way around?
00:32:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Closed is after resolution is before. happens before closing.
00:32:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, OK. I thought it was the other way around. OK. So resolved is when they settled the case. Closed is we've been paid. OK. When I asked that question, I asked it the other way around, and you said that was correct. So we missed each other. All right. well, okay, can you look at it in terms of these numbers? wait, hold on a second. that's the case, then let me look at this. So 120 and 173, and let me go to last year for resolutions. Two thirty one. We're twenty one. That's okay. Okay. Sorry, I'm just still trying to like wrap my head around.
00:33:42 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
The numbers are going to be off, no matter what, because some cases have more than one resolution, but none are going to have more than one close date.
00:33:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, regardless what I'm looking at, I'm trying to look at improvement on the team or at least trajectory. Same, improving, declining numbers you would have to pull are these two numbers that you know, you pull our average attorney fee. I'm looking at that.
00:34:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Right. And then time from open to close, which we don't have yet on this report.
00:34:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but we certainly can pull it because we have an open date in a closed date. we can definitely make that happen. Yeah, well, so we'll get that added to here so we can just look at it all together. So but the fact that he's he's resolving more cases, like he's he's getting closer to Samantha's pace. This year does that doesn't say anything to you because of the attorney fees?
00:34:46 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, let's do it mathematically, 173 divided by 120. So she's 1.44 times faster than him.
00:34:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, and that's the Let's look at last year, though, because she was more than that last year, she was almost 33%.
00:35:11 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
1.38.
00:35:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay, so last year, his average attorney fees for the year were 14,000 and hers were 18, and they've both dropped so far this year. Hars are 17, I think, and his is 11.
00:35:41 - Dan Ryan
What makes her faster?
00:35:43 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
that's the question, I guess. That's really what it comes down. She micromanages her team.
00:35:51 - Dan Ryan
Lauren, she has a process that she micromanages.
00:35:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, and she has a team because you guys to move things around that is compatible with her doing that, right? if she had Cynthia on her team, that would make an impact, because Cynthia probably can't handle that very well. Cynthia is on Patrick's team, But I'm saying if she was on Samantha's team, that would probably impact Sam's production. But Cynthia also probably wouldn't last very long in Sweet Law, if that was her only option. Is that also right, do you think? So that's part of the, that's one of the things I'm actually really excited about in learning to work with these guys, because here's the thing, we all know that you can't just go hire everybody that can work at Sam's pace. What we can do is see if there are some of the processes that she does. Sorry, it's my damn reminder. And the styles that she has that can be, you know, implemented elsewhere. where what I do know is Patrick's gunning for her numbers. And every time he asks her questions, she answers thoroughly, doesn't hold back, gives lots of information, and he's soaking it all up. So that's good. I don't know, like, so Lorentz has Gary and he's saying that she, like trying to get any information from her is like pulling teeth. And I asked him if he thought it was because she is just a withholding type of person, doesn't talk much, or if she's a little bit like I'm a single mom with four kids, I don't want to rock the boat, I'm just going to show up and like try not to make waves. And so that's the conversation we're going to dig into a little bit more next week and find out if, because that's the case. So I was explaining to them that several times I've hired a right-hand person and it's been a female too. to support CEOs that I'm working with, case in point Dan and Stacey. Stacey's job was from the beginning to help with accountability, make sure that things get captured, follow up with people and make sure jobs are getting done. But even though she knew that from the beginning, she was very hesitant to do it. She improved it over time as she kind of like dipped her toe in a on this. Nobody's going to yell at me. Nobody's going to hate me. You know, this isn't going to create a hostile environment. And so now she's really good. I'd be like, hey, where's this? You said you were going to do this. Where's this? You know what I mean? Which is what it was from the beginning, but she had because of previous work experience and just how a lot of times women who behave that way show up and are treated, they're just like, eh, I don't want to do that because someone's going to call me a , basically. So. Oh, I'm wondering if Viri might have had that type of experience where maybe we can encourage it out of her to talk a little bit more about whatever's going on, where she needs help, what can be improved, because at the end of the day, like we know it's difficult to find new people, to onboard them, to train them, whatever, it takes a long time to replace anybody, really, especially your attorneys, so everything that we can do to make them more independent, more strong, more autonomous, better communicators, more reliable, like Patrick said, Cynthia is doing better after he has just sit there and tell her, this is what you need to do. Don't wait for me to tell you to do this, do this. But he did it in a way where he was super concerned about not hurting her feelings, not plowing over her in, in, in, And he said that, you know, he doesn't get really stressed out about everything, like he's driven, he's competitive, but the things that stress them out, like talking to difficult clients, people that are mad, yelling at them, whatever, he's like, that doesn't bother him at all because of his training. So anyway, just all these different things, like looking at these numbers, there's, there's a compatibility thing on the pot, right? So Sam's team probably has people who are more on the pace of being able to go hard, have her drive them. And let's say Patrick could do that. He doesn't have people necessarily. I don't know how elsey or at least it's elsey, right? Oh, yeah. don't know, you know, what she can handle pace wise, but it isn't pace caps, basically. Oh, and one of the things that Patrick asked about was how, and I know that he's not on the incentive program yet, but he's thinking about what does he do, how does he keep them motivated and driven to keep working harder when they don't get incentive pay for working harder. He says, if it was me, I wouldn't be motivated to work any harder than I am. And Lauren said what he does is he takes incentive pay out of his pocket to give to his team. And I was wondering, you know, is there a sweet lot policy for that? Like it, it does it not behoove you to create a program that is based on the team or do you want it managed as though basically everybody's their own, not just pod, but like their own little company and the attorneys have like, you know, it's almost like it's their own business inside of your business, where they're figuring out how to incentive pay them.
00:41:59 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I wasn't. Yeah. Yeah, that's something that I haven't done particularly well. Sam's team gets paid on a quarterly bonus if they hit their goal for the quarter. Tyler pays at his team more ad hoc month to month. Lorenz is doing the same. It hasn't been a formalized program and part of the reason is because the attorneys get paid so much. Like our payroll's 34% of our gross, which is high. should be like 25%. But Mary and I have talked about creating like a quarterly incentive plan. Not even just quarterly but half yearly because full years too long for people who are going to miss by September, they're just going to stop trying. So to do it where it's 30,000 per attorney if they can hit the goals for six months straight, basically. On average, you know, I don't want them to
00:43:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
hold cases that's always the problem and then for the teams to split up 6 000 between each of them so most teams have four people so it'd be like 1,500 each so okay i'm sure like three grandi here i i would love to sit with you and try to work that out a little bit more because i feel like first of all your attorneys um you want them to have a certain amount of but they're not all putting the same level of business training and experience and leadership as you are and i think that you're better off as having consistency across your company me, rather than having almost like individual companies within your company, because ultimately, they look to you, your attorneys look to you, you're, and I think that you'll just get better results across the board if it's a corporate right wide kind of structure, and helping helping your leaders be better leaders, not micromanaging them, but being aware of their data, giving them some reviews, just saying like, you know, this is how your team is performing month over month, quarter over quarter, year over year, et cetera. Yeah, so could we set a goal for having completed and implemented that type of incentive program for the teams so that they do all have incentive programs to work? for performance-wise.
00:45:02 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, but I'd rather do it sooner rather than later because we can still do that back up the year because it's only the first week of July.
00:45:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I mean, it's only limited by when you want to do it and when you're willing to do it. We could have an extra meaning if we needed to, but I would really like to see that happen because I think that it really supports everybody, your attorneys and the teams.
00:45:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
I think Monday we should definitely talk about it then.
00:45:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me do that and put that in my notes. Okay, I think that was it for right now in terms of like you What was already in my brain now? have to kind of just process what I was talking about are while while I'm waiting for my brain to catch up and think about the next thing. Um, was there anything new that's come up that you want to discuss? Oh, actually. I do want to tell you what something that Lorenz did which I was impressed with. It's not a major thing and it should have happened anyway, but it did and that's the point is that Lorenz was doing through multiple iterations working with file reviews as a team. And he's basically got the two like sub pods Jessica and Mike and then John and Barry. And they were all meaning together going over file reviews, but the team had complained that they're basically wasting time while one pod goes over there. did that about month ago and I will find out more this week how he tracked this and how he can quantify, qualify what he said but what he said was he can notice an improvement in their trajectory having gone over the five hour views together that it's making an improvement but it's only a month long and I don't know how he's tracking and measuring it but just the fact that he's gotten to that point was I think it was good that he's working on first of all noticing what the team needs and just trying to get everybody on the same page trying to improve performance and trying to lead them yeah so I didn't want to say that let's see everyone does I was looking at my star stuff yeah anyway okay so that was it now Is there anything that we haven't brought up that you want to tell us about or ask about?
00:48:10 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Really I mean the issuing ticket figure out what we're gonna do with it.
00:48:13 - Dan Ryan
We're gonna pull things from them or what not I'm all for pulling I mean like I'm doing a lot better than we are quite frankly now For like HQ intake, sorry So we can keep them with what they're gonna quantify right now, and then yeah And I think So the absurdly thing like him and I we mapped it out like on the phone It's the big thing that they did was three calls in an hour, right? So I Could create an automation that's the add-surdly automation That does that so it's like oh Okay, let's try this more aggressive thing with the lead source that's getting those results elsewhere, right? what we have is we know the intake team can close. We know that certainly the leads can close. So the bit that's different that supposedly is driving their clients average 14% whereas we've only ever seen five from any vendor except for malquantify who well we know maybe their numbers are better. So it's like okay if it's either that and I don't know that I mean I don't know that it certainly gets better leads and I guess technically they do if you compare look at them as like a monkey but it's like okay if this dude's gonna be like hey what can we do to make this better? Hey no one else has ever done that. It's like okay. Hey, what can we make this better? That would be making a custom automation that's just for them. And then it's like, OK, does it lift? Do we get a lift from adding three calls on the front end? And because if the call connects, it came over, right? The calls connected, the intake team's taking over. So that seemed to be the biggest differentiator that we don't have. I say build and add thirdly automation, run their leads through that, and see what happens. And pull from HQ.
00:50:41 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
OK.
00:50:44 - Dan Ryan
All right. Then that's what we're going to do.
00:50:47 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So just recap for HQ, we'll just have them do the quantified leads.
00:50:52 - Dan Ryan
And I'll pull the TRG leads. Yeah, so we changed quantified to come to us. first. So now, like, so basically we're like, for some reason, though, they're still getting I know, Eric, Eric hit up, don't go or submit or whatever their name is. He confirmed that it was that way. And I'm like, but that if that doesn't make the thing that you said. So I'm not sure how it's occurring. And Eric, I haven't, Eric has not figured it out yet. But we will. But the point is that we're making it so that, like, we're the first point of contact that therefore we can always control it and see and see what's going on. Because when they do it, it's like, you got to reach out to them. then what are you doing about what is
00:52:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. And take script where we at with that.
00:52:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
We've gone through it more than a few times. It still not where I would like it to be.
00:52:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Okay. So, are, is it going to stay on your schedule to keep going through it? Like where I don't want it to die on the vine.
00:52:32 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It's not, it's got to get done within the next week and a half because then I've only got past two or two more weeks. it has to be done before he goes.
00:52:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And we have been discussing trying to figure out a way to create a client slash case ranking system to. Well, help intake. Just better figure out the call. I feel like the intake script would be a good preface to that.
00:53:07 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
It is starting the conversation the right way.
00:53:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:53:15 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Oh, so they just throw over the place when they start.
00:53:22 - Dan Ryan
Right. When's Pat?
00:53:23 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
When's Pat too even?
00:53:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Two weeks.
00:53:25 - Dan Ryan
Okay. I'm gonna, if you're good with to refer to be like, hey, I'm gonna compile the whole thing. What's currently there and the ones that I sent you and I'd be like, hey, we're gonna make this switch and it looks like it will resolve a bunch of typing that they do. And because they I'd go through a bunch of leads because of the ads, at least stuff. And I'm like, Oh, we gotta get this in. So if you're good with that, I'm gonna compile those into one giant list and be like, Hey, this is the new Then I can go back to Josh and he can back sort of back turned on reason people. That's going to be a little bit of a , but it'll happen in the background.
00:54:13 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:54:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, that covers everything that I had.
00:54:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Well, Patsy's out. We're splitting her role kind of into. So we're to do one that double check files before they're converted because she's very. Detail oriented. And then Mia is going to be the backup of yes or no to cases because she's been around the long since seen the most. So she has a pretty good idea of what to take enough to take more questions to ask.
00:54:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:54:48 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Obviously, I'm going to be heavily, heavily, heavily involved, but you know, we have to go back in case I'm on an airplane or something. And they're told basically if. They have any questions at all. Just put it on the attorney intake channel of the attorneys to decide whether they take it or not.
00:55:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because we've talked about this before, down the road a little bit, especially after I've had some more time working with Patrick and Lauren's because it's really illuminating to me. Maybe we could spend a little time, maybe a quarter or something working with the intake team.
00:55:25 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:55:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But let's get the scripts first. Maybe we could come up with the client ranking system. All of that could probably go hand in hand, let's get them on a jumping off point.
00:55:38 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
And then Patsy's going to be gone for how long? Six months.
00:55:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, right.
00:55:45 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
So probably come back to the beginning of the year. Some point for coming back around Christmas. So probably the beginning of the year.
00:55:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And something for you to just ponder is, would it be more useful to try to. get something going before she comes back because she's gone to just add some strength or wait till she gets back and get everybody on the same page. I think part of that is just kind of watching and seeing what happens first getting the intake script and seeing what happens with that. But I do think sooner rather than later, I think Q4 might be a really good time to get some of that work done while we're heading into the new year, things kind of slow down anyway. And so maybe that would be a good time to not be too overwhelming but then to get them going the holidays. But anyway, so if you could just ponder over that and think about what- And you just see how they do first what Patu's going quite frankly. Okay, yeah, so well and that would that would line up with it too so we get some observation time but okay cool. So we'll table that for a little bit and Anything else? Okay. All right. Well, I was just thinking about the very beginning of this conversation and just wishing you the best of luck. Oh, Mark, I've been meaning to ask. Gosh, I keep getting, because I don't have my phone in my hand when I mean to ask you, but what are you doing in the mornings now?
00:57:34 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Meditation for about the first 30 minutes.
00:57:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You are.
00:57:40 - Dan Ryan
What kind of meditation?
00:57:45 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Through the nose, after the nose, then something called bliss meditation.
00:57:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Are you doing that at home?
00:57:54 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Are you going to the office and doing it? I'm doing it at home in five in the morning. I'm not going to the office as soon as I wake up.
00:58:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I was just checking because they're staying so late. don't know what's going on.
00:58:05 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Like, I'm just going to be upset like, you know, before seven. Here's two plus hours.
00:58:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you're not checking your phone right away anymore, right?
00:58:20 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Rarely. Like when I first get up, I just look at it to make sure there's not like, you know, 20 missed calls from someone or something.
00:58:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's it. You don't get pulled into anything.
00:58:35 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
No, I get the other stuff done first.
00:58:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good job. Good job. I was, I was really worried about how that was going to start going. So nice job. Very, very glad to hear that. OK, all right, then. Put the mommy team that way from the next. was worried about you. All right, number questions, number, anything. Can we same time next week? No, no, not same time.
00:59:03 - Dan Ryan
Monday, next week. Yeah, I was like, I don't think so.
00:59:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what day it is already. I'm out of it. I won't see my girls for four days. So I'm just like, anyway, all right. Well, Mr. Mark, have a, and Dan, we have a meeting right after this. So, Mark, have a good holiday and a great weekend and take very good care of yourself.
00:59:26 - mark sweet (3) (sweetlaw.com)
Stop.
00:59:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, ease.
00:59:30 - Dan Ryan
Bye.
00:59:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bye.
00:59:32 - Dan Ryan
Bye.
00:59:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Let's see. Oh, wait. Do you need a break or anything?

Hello.
00:00:02 - Dan’s iPhone
Hello.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how is Dan Ryan today? Mark's dog has pneumonia.
00:00:13 - Dan’s iPhone
You won't.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ronin.
00:00:16 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. I'll call him said dog.
00:00:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. The neighbor dog had pneumonia and they didn't tell.
00:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone
The neighbor.
00:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone
Ouch.
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:00:30 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. That's... pneumonia is communicable among dogs.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If it's viral, it is. Well, you also know. Because there's viral and bacterial pneumonia. back then, viral is always contagious. And he has to be on 10 days of medication. he said they have to cancel their trip to New York. So I'm guessing at his mom and somebody. I don't know who, but... And him and Jonah are on a vacation together right now. So... that's probably super stressful for him.
00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh yeah.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh. My dog. She's got this weird like dark spot growing like her hair. She's getting this dark spot all of a sudden. She's a poodle and a bichon frise so they don't have spots and it's dark and it's wiry and I'm like what the crap is going on? I don't have a tumor or something and she bit as she tried to like bite a skunk in the butt before the sun even came up a couple days ago. That was a terrible way to wake up because my daughter's like mom she's foaming at the mouth and I didn't know if she was my daughter or the dog because she was just going to seminary.
00:01:51 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. we discussing right now?
00:01:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just like I'm trying my best not to cuss everybody out right now but don't tell me nothing like a name. Stop.
00:02:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Follow me.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
00:02:01 - Dan’s iPhone
Whoever it is.
00:02:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah, it still smells. So it's been a good doggy week. All right, let's get on to this. It's funny because when I go into my notes, I have it's just weird, actually. I don't know if this was a new notebook because because this, hold on, these cannot be from 2022. The notes date says October 2022, but like thing I'm a jig and is in here.
00:02:37 - Dan’s iPhone
That's 2022.
00:02:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Really?
00:02:40 - Dan’s iPhone
There's no way we're talking about that recently.
00:02:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, no, I know, but I think it was way longer ago than that.
00:02:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, no, probably not.
00:02:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm to go look at my notebook and see if like there's more here or something because usually, anyway, the oldest note is at the top. I feel like there must have been... whatever. that was just funny. Okay, here's the call log for fan flow remarks had sent it to Dan, but I've saved it to the fan flow you know as well. What do I want to call log for fan flowy? Oh, fan flowy, not okay. Okay, that's what that is what I wanted.
00:03:32 - Dan’s iPhone
I got it.
00:03:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, taking a break from G4 because we're working on fan flow in mom and mapping out all the stuff, ads, ad copy, lead, mac and neck, superfan, band growth system and waiting for the book And Stacy was supposed to give you a task to complete your GA for container by the time we'll for goes live. So we're trying to do that happen.
00:04:12 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't log into team works.
00:04:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I couldn't tell you. Well, did you did you create the content where we are?
00:04:19 - Dan’s iPhone
What's today that I have a created container now, but it's not. When he first he's working launching. I actually did work on it a little yesterday. It's worth of percentage value.
00:04:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But even though you don't work log into teamwork, are you still meeting with Stacy and Eric Monday, Wednesday and Friday?
00:04:46 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm just saying that like I don't like if she I thought you were asking, did she create the task and teamwork? I literally have no idea. Um, I use teamwork only to respond to like tasks that exist. So I know. Yeah, sometimes I log in, like mostly I respond to email, but if I have to upload stuff, I tend to log in. So I just logged in to respond to Greg.
00:05:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, are you still meeting with them every Monday, Wednesday, Friday?
00:05:19 - Dan’s iPhone
Yep.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
good. Write it down.
00:05:23 - Dan’s iPhone
Just going to get more. Their favorite meaning.
00:05:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So does Stacy ask you about tasks then?
00:05:40 - Dan’s iPhone
We do a thing called, so we also have like a, I know if you know this. But maybe if you've heard this one before. So once a month, we have an in person meeting. It's the last something of the month. Again, I forget what the schedule is. Pick it to Friday. I think it's the last Friday of every month, and in that meeting, we go through everything. Anything like it's old, it's new, it's anything that she has on this other sheet that she maintains. And then the Thursday after that meeting is called Old Test Thursday, where I'm only supposed to work for kind of old tasks, which is another sheet that she maintains that I reference when it's that Thursday. And sometimes I knock those things out, but that list is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. We might not need to keep doing that. A bunch of them are woofer based, they'll be done at this moment. But yeah. So yeah, we go over everything, topped about them on that one thing, and then on that she just pings me like, hey, have you seen this? Someone commented back on this, right? So, Like, that was what just happened, somebody, like, I didn't know it, but for like a month, my basis email wasn't working. So I wasn't getting emails from anybody at all. So if they emailed to that note, I was emailing out from D&D or whatever, but I figured it, and I fixed it. But she'll like pin me on tasks that are like static or, you know, sitting there, she's like, Hey, someone, they comment to back, you need to go look at this. But she'll bring that up on the calls to, Hey, sometimes she sends slacks and opens, let's go look at it right now. Yeah.
00:07:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I have a couple of questions for her and teamwork. So that will help me. so have you, this is what I thought was going to happen, but just wanted to check, did you not work on anything with GA before between last weekend now?
00:07:56 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I do. Oh, you did start. Yeah, I just started. Mapping out like, some of the stuff from Mercer was like, he uses these, I think they're called templates. Am I ever wrong? But there's, I think they're templates. There's template libraries in GTM. We have never used them. So I was mapping out like, hey, we're not going to do, giving you an example, clarity. So Microsoft Clarity, we're doing it the old way, where you paste the HTML. The new way is to use the Clarity template. The same thing would apply to like Hotjar, but we don't use Hotjar anymore. But it may be Wistia. I was looking at like, okay, we got to start using templates where there are templates. So yeah.
00:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like they have templates for Hotjar and Wistia or there.
00:09:09 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay. Yeah, it's like a look. There's like search area where you can search for templates. So there's those and then there's like one other one that I cannot remember the name of. So yeah, don't think that one exists anymore. That was one of the questions I asked them, but they were referencing another one that doesn't exist or so we'll be using that. I asked them how we're doing that now. They explained it to me. can't learn one.
00:09:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're getting super deep and growly voice where I can't understand you.
00:09:42 - Dan’s iPhone
Listen, I can't help my voice.
00:09:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can help your voice.
00:09:47 - Dan’s iPhone
God gave it to me.
00:09:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You sing.
00:09:50 - Dan’s iPhone
So you definitely know how to help your voice. Sorry. Yeah, so that's it. Just like, oh, hey, we need you. templates where there are templates but these are the templates that we use and then like we're no longer like hot showers out where we that used to be part of our container will no longer be in our container. Oh the other bit is uh well I didn't do this but I just remember this kind of uh gotta send this to Norio but they said do not use visual website optimizer in GTM which I've experienced that issue but they're like yeah don't do it. I gotta figure out a way if we can put that I'm gonna have Norio add like a scripts area to the GTMizer that I can just load grips in which is probably good secret.
00:10:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You need to have Norio add scripts area to what?
00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone
GTMizer I mean it's literally for PWA on our communities. for theirs. It should just be like VWM and no one would use it. I mean, you could use it otherwise, but we'll maybe mark it as VWO.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Does Optimize that you've been existing anymore or Crazy Egg?
00:11:23 - Dan’s iPhone
I don't know about Crazy Egg, but Optimize that he does, I believe.
00:11:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:11:29 - Dan’s iPhone
But I've got like this grandfather account with VWO and never letting it go. Yeah. Yeah. 60 bucks a month.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice.
00:11:39 - Dan’s iPhone
You mean these?
00:11:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. Wait, what the? Oh, I must have it open into windows. That's not useful. So, let me look at this. What date is this October 4th? So you came up with the model, so the SaaS model plus coaching plus buying catalogs plus sign artists slash rev share plus distribution revenue streams and you might not say you need to model how the revenue will look percentages of each of that. for you and the guys. So what's the situation with buying was it lands down.
00:12:33 - Dan’s iPhone
Superrolls, oh, lands down. I don't know. I'm really talked about. I met with.
00:12:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:12:44 - Dan’s iPhone
I was going to run up by Rhonda because so meet with her next week, I think I was going to run up by her, but then I met with this dude. This guy that. Joe interviewed on his podcast of the two. Oh, so the podcast the guy said. a couple of interesting things. So, many, many years ago, think it was Ezra Fierstown. I don't know where he said this, but he, I don't know if he was on a podcast or something, but he was talking about like, you know, he started making all this money and then he had like a tax person and then the whole, the whole thing, right, like around and he said, but then he was also starting to get around people had more money than him. And one of those guys said to him, hey, if you're a tax person and CFP makes less money than you do, then you need a new tax person than CFP. And he's like, because they can't, they, how can they possibly do that, right? They don't know what it's like to make that much money, like they don't know what it's like to, and I was like, that's an interesting point, like, like, why would I like, I wouldn't go hire someone to run ads that hadn't run as as well as I had, right? So I'm like, what would you, right? But you don't think about it in those terms of the thing. That sort of stuck with me, but I never really did anything about it. And then like, you know, Rhonda, not the bag I'm wrong, but right. Rhonda doesn't listen to me, right? Rhonda's executing Rhonda's plan, which I get, right? So her plan is like conservative. have a target. We're trying to, we're trying to end up where you're maintaining the same lifestyle until into your 90s so that you never run out of money. And that's a common sort of plan. It's certainly better than the plan I had. And so she's working that plan. And then the dude that Joe was interviewing said something like, you have a tax preparer, or do you have a tax planner, these like a tax. preparer looks backwards and then says this is how much money you owe. He's like a tax planner looks forward and they say they look at how much money you might owe and then they put strategies in place to mitigate that. And he's like if you have a tax preparer you need to have a tax planner and he's like that makes a lot of sense. And then he was doing some other stuff like you've probably seen the whole infinite banking or the family bank thing that comes up every five years. It's back.
00:15:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think is always thinking about that and wanting to work on it.
00:15:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, I'll send you this dude. I like this dude. I talk to this guy. So there and then my buddy actually wrote a book on it. That's how I actually got it. I actually heard about it somewhere else and then this dude that I know here actually wrote a book on it and he sells those policies. Well, what these guys do like I've seen other their people do is like, it's the basis of their sort of wealth pyramid, literally. yeah, when you start with that, and then they also go into like alternative investments and tax strategic investments. one of the things that he said on the call was like, yeah, you he's like, if you're, oh, the other thing he said in Joe's thing was, hey, if you're someone that's got like an eminent, um, crazy use, whatever. It was basically like, if you're someone that's going to be selling your business and you're going to have a huge influx of cash, he's like, you need, you need to have a plan before that happens, right? need to be, you need to have your tax strategy laid out so that you're not paying 40%.
00:16:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not paying this huge cap gains. What Dexter would tell you is instead of a tax planner or taxpayer or accountant at all, what you would want is a wealth manager.
00:17:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that's what these guys are.
00:17:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, they know the laws even better.
00:17:06 - Dan’s iPhone
So what he's saying is like, hey, we have like a whole suite, right, that we have lawyers, have tax people, we have the accountants, we have the investors, and we're all sort of following the same program, and we all investment opportunities, and then they also will help you sort of go through one, so like my example is like, what if I want to buy multiplex?
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like, I don't know about that.
00:17:40 - Dan’s iPhone
So yeah, oh yeah, no, we can bring it to you can bring it to us, bring it to bring it to the group or whatever, bring it to this mastermind, whatever the hell you want to call it. And then we could walk you through how to do the deal, like they're not in on the deal, but they tell you what to look for and what to, you know, negotiate about. Okay, yeah, that's exactly.
00:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what I want but he's like we don't help you find the deal but he's like we do find other deals that you can invest in or not but one of his things was like he's saying that you invest in energy you invest in oil and that these create these huge tax offsets but he's like what do you think you're paying tax right now I said I honestly don't know like it's got to be 40% he's like I could probably cut so sorry I was just thinking because Seth is big on trusts and he's like been studying this for years and like I am wanting to have conversations about it but so that I can understand it better because it's a scary kind of thing but basically and I just out of curiosity you might want to talk to him I don't I don't know how rebellious you want to be I already helped up
00:19:00 - Dan’s iPhone
That's my problem is that like the parts that make sense to me. I've executed right. So it made sense to me years ago have a solo 401k. I don't know why I set it up. And then when I got with Rob, she was like, how did you do this? It's like, how did you even know to do this and how did you do it? And then she's like, is this real? got as far as I know and it's real. And she took it over. And that was the right thing right now. It's this vehicle that I use. And then I got like, I have this one insurance policy with Denise and I, this was the dude that does the whole life. Like, I wasn't ready to commit the whole life at the time because I did. I mean, I understood it, but I was like, I don't think I could do that. I could definitely do it now. I don't think I was like financially really where I thought I could do it and not put myself in position where it might come back to bite me in the , but although I sort of think that isn't actually real thing. knew we were going to move, right? So I was like, I might need money for the house. I can't have money tied up in anything, so whatever. So I didn't do it then. But what I did do then was he had this other life-in-term thing. It's like a second to die policy. And it's basically like, essentially once all's been done, it's like the if I die or Denise dies, one of us dies, the other one gets like $3 million, something like that. And so he was like, this is how the policy works. And I told it to Ronda and Ronda was like, there's no way. There's no way it works like that. She's like, I need to meet with this guy. And we met with him. We went through the numbers and Ronda was like, holy , it does work the way. She's like, what the? And she's like, yeah, you could do that. I got the trust. So I set that up first. I think I got that. But then, What is this? His name is David Dark Angelou. He was like a friend of a friend.
00:21:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I heard that name before.
00:21:09 - Dan’s iPhone
He used to work with Tony Roberts bunch.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Way back in the Roberts or Robins.
00:21:15 - Dan’s iPhone
Robins, sorry. He's like he's never really been in the Internet marketing world.
00:21:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I know I've seen that face too. long time ago. Oh, not that dude. Okay. Go away.
00:21:31 - Dan’s iPhone
So he was like someone that I met years ago and like he actually recently hit me up. was actually going to hit him up about this whole life thing because I know that he knows that game. Right. He knows where to find the policies and yada yada. So when I talked to this other dude, I was like, well, hey, don't have to buy the policy through us. So they're like, we just help you. Oh, dude. Sorry.
00:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's try to get it. Subscribe to him so I don't forget.
00:22:00 - Dan’s iPhone
They just show you like all the strategies and then they have like investment opportunities. Your paying for access is basically what it blows down to, access to people that are doing the same thing. he's like, look, you'll be in the room with people that have $100 million, just straight up just so you know, but I could show up with the whole life policy of, yeah, you don't have to buy it through us. Okay. I thought it was interesting and it's like, okay, so your base thing is not the thing that you're making money on, like the thing that you're telling everyone to do first. He could make money on it, but he's like, no, you can, you're ready to trust that up, would just make sure you can just go through the checklist and make sure it's set up the way it should be. Okay.
00:22:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Um, all this stuff fascinates me and I think that my guy is finally going to be done with crap in a few months, I don't know, I really hope so, because 10 years is a long time. Yeah, it is. It would break most people or they would move out of the country or just be thrown in prison because they tie your hand so bad you do something and that's the consequence, which is why I'm actually interested in having these conversations with Seth about trust and stuff, even though I'm sure he already knows a lot of that but doesn't want to talk about it because they just scared the life out of you. Anyway, um, lands down.
00:23:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Okay, so, so, anyway, I'm to talk to Rhonda about that. And I did talk to, I did talk to this, this Dave person about it. So like, you can bring, I was like, so I could talk to you about like these things and I'm considering things like, yeah, and I think I gave them that as an example. And I go right. I could like, oh, the other thing I asked them because I actually weirdly or not, right. for this dude, shut up. I started looking into whole life again on my own. I was like, can you everything I looked at? Like, you couldn't pre-fund it. And so I asked him, I said, can you pre-fund one of these? He's like, you can. He's like, you just got to, it is possible. You can do it. It's like, you just got to make sure that that's the setup that you get yourself. then you can pre-fund it. Because what I was reading was like, you have to fund it for three years before you can actually then take a loan against it. So in my version of the world, I would fund it. And then if I do the Lansdown thing, I borrow the money from myself, which is the whole point of doing that . And then use that to buy Lansdown. Then I pay the interest on Lansdown with the money that I'm making from Lansdown. So I make a little less. Whatever. And then he's like, again, you just pay back at any time, right? not like a real loan. then, of course, that's where you use to like buy your kids. Give your kids a loan for their house. Oh, like if you have enough money there, it's like, okay, cool.
00:25:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that's still on the table. Let's see. I'm looking at last week or actually probably the last couple of weeks with mom course development or just stack or offer or anything.
00:25:45 - Dan’s iPhone
So Sean is evaluating circle as the community and it sounds like it sounds like it's so funny. He's like, I don't think this is going to work. It would be great if it did this. So he's doing this all via text and he's basically just texting himself. like he's texting questions to the group. And then in the course of like nine texts, he figured out he convinced himself the circle was the right solution.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Was I glad you worked that out with yourself.
00:26:17 - Dan’s iPhone
But he's sold on it now. He's like, Oh, course, this is what I was saying the whole time. So we got to get that set up. It's set up. It's on the trial, whatever, but we got to get it set up. So that's now going to officially be the thing. Then that's where the course would live. So now we got to figure out I got Greg like finished the cover today. And then I just sent him a message. was like, Hey, I can either just drip. He did the cover in the first worksheet. I said, I can either drip the worksheets on you one in a row, one in time, or I can dump them all on you like in a priority order. Let me know. but you prefer. So based on his answer, I will do whatever he says, my plan is just to go, because he did literally did the first one on the book. So then we'll do the second one, the third one, fourth one, I think there's like nine to 12 or the other. So we'll get all those done, and then the book's done, and then I had sent Eric and Abhishek, those guys, the book funnel, all I was like, we can build this on new bases, right? they're like, yep. Then I sort of told Maria, hey, don't be surprised if I can tell you women a project here in the near future center. I don't think I sent her anything though. just emailed her back for me, but she told me.
00:27:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got her. She's getting big co-honies now. She put out a $15,000 offer and a done for you instead of the $2,000 stuff, and she's just feeling good. and she's got people who are would be a good fit for that.
00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone
So then the course that we would have to make is the do it like just walking them through like how to do all the ads and stuff. So we got to sort of map that out because it's like I guess we'll just we'll do it like we'll make the email portion but then put it in your CRM and then the CRM we're going to show on the screen is ours. It's family but it's like you would just send her in your CRM whatever it is. I do mail chimping like in whatever is. And then I was going to hit up the super res guys I was thinking about that and I'm like I was just probably so I was going to hit them up and be like hey let's do like a hybrid hybrid non-commercial model. So it would be I pay you to customize it. I get to call it fan flowy. I am not going to sell it. Right, so that eliminates me competing with you not only am I not going to sell it I'm only going to allow people that have already become a lead for me to get access to it So it's not even good like you won't even be able to go download it from the site Right, so it's like it's sort of behind It's gated to whatever degree And then I'll pay you The customization fee and then I'll pay you a rip Like a quarterly rip on We're either a flat monthly licensing fee. I have no idea how many people are going to download this, right? So that's probably the best course of action like hey, you're making a Thousand bucks a month. I'll pay you 200 Let's pay you 200 a month to have to as a license fee and then we can sort of work out Another deal after that, but also I will I will helping market super-us. If you really think it's that great, I'll help you market it, but you have to cut me in on super-us.
00:30:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I vacillate instantaneously between their short-sidedness, but also the fact that, like, maybe reality is a little bit...
00:30:26 - Dan’s iPhone
I mean, I get it. It's big idea to see us, right? It's like they're so married to this thing. It's like... And then I'm not risking anything, right? It's like the only risk I'm taking is that they'll cut me out, but then I'll lock them into like a five-year deal. Like I want a five-year deal that you cannot back out of, and it will be very similar to what we did with like exam matrix when we got, we licensed their software and rebranded it, but we did sell it. And then... And we had a five-year deal that they were locked in. when they sold it, that contract went with them. when that guy sold it, that contract went with them until the final buyer was starting to be an addict and started re-interpreting the contract. And we were already on the path of building our own software in the background. And then lo and behold, when our contract ends, we had our own software.
00:31:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oops. I feel like y'all didn't get left again at the same time. I slept terribly last night.
00:31:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm not sure if I was sleeping anymore.
00:31:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
thought I like, oh. I stopped wearing my Applewats and my Aurorang because I sleep better without them. But I also got a lot of data for a long time. So I know, you know, got my baselines really good. But I also ate garbage yesterday.
00:31:56 - Dan’s iPhone
So there was that.
00:32:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I needed. that it was a girl thing. was like, I'm eating cake and Mexican.
00:32:04 - Dan’s iPhone
And cake.
00:32:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. let me go through this. So one of the things that we're talking about was defining who should I have a community because they're not for everyone. Like, how big should your following be? What's the criteria? there's, I think I already said following size, that kind of thing. Have you guys talked about that at all?
00:32:39 - Dan’s iPhone
Uh, no. I don't think that came up on the call like it was supposed to.
00:32:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So I'm going to do this and say, oh, What would you call that call that a mom call or?
00:33:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Yes, Monday.
00:33:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Monday what?
00:33:12 - Dan’s iPhone
Mom.
00:33:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:33:14 - Dan’s iPhone
I think it says rent. mean, I think the meeting is like to rent the table.
00:33:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Oh, actually said that earlier to her. Oh, fan flowy call log fan flowy call. Dan wants to discuss nine thirty nine sixteen seven twenty nine. I don't want to. I don't to a document making brand new change and I don't even have to edit access anyway so I'll put that in there um I'll just mark bring a list of stuff stuck on the call because he clearly has one where does it live I never got that you just get that yeah where does where does that how does that happen the google doc okay um what are you yesterday yes she said that that it that must be the fan flowy call-up google doc or something else huh yeah that's it so it's not I thought it was a transfer to my what what transfer why are you some of the transfer I guess that's what's called I'm no idea oh yeah what are minutes of you maybe more like it let's see That's interesting. Beta testers for the seating planner.
00:35:17 - Dan’s iPhone
How that going? What am I Google answer? I went through my email and I found every Google ads rep that's ever reached out to me. He's like, I guess they just cycled her and give you a new one every quarter. I emailed all of them. Okay. And the oldest one, which is weird. So I just got a new one like after this started. So I think I got a new one on like Tuesday, randomly emailed her, emailed the one back to me yesterday. And we're like, are you still having this problem? And I just emailed them like, yes, still having this problem. They're like, oh, because they're like, if you're in the problem, I can escalate it. It's pretty run a mic. So hopefully it'll get escalated and solved. But I'm still stuck. Like, I cannot get ads to run on these accounts that have this payment or a file issue. Oh, and also, I don't want to run this on Mark's card, even though Mark's like, oh, you can put on my card. No, I can't, because it's mine. This is not yours, Mark. This is mine.
00:36:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you can't get beta testers, because you need to run ads? OK. OK.
00:36:54 - Dan’s iPhone
It can lead to your car. The leads will lead to beta. to test versus the thought yeah no I got that um yeah no it's just the thought now we're gonna breathe it oh you're red is great let's see what is the like status of that project I did one and I sent it to Sean and was like hey can you peruse this and see us right I don't know if he's like that yet I'm pretty sure I'm right um and I'm doing the other one but the other one the chat TPT was nowhere near successful with the second round I don't know why because it's the language is a little more nuanced than whatever so when it categorizes a bunch of stuff they're all wrong but a lot. I have to manually go through and like recategorize them and there's just taking forever. So I'm doing chunks. And then, of course, I screwed up and resorted the sheet and then lost my place and I couldn't resort it back to where it was. And I was like, oh, great. So I didn't start over, but I'm probably doing duplicative work because I don't recognize stuff that I had already done. But whatever, just don't sort it again.
00:38:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You cut out for a minute. So I know. I think I got that just a minute.
00:38:38 - Dan’s iPhone
I'm doing a second one. So the first one worked out.
00:38:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I did a second one. You know, I have, I'm wondering sometimes now because chat GPT like about two and a half months ago, maybe three months ago now, probably two and a And I'm wondering if like. like if that's well obviously I think something actually happens because I used it too many times for that logic to make any sense for it to like be less logical and it is less logical so there are two kinds of things that I think about is it is it a I don't know like I wonder if it's setting it up so that we are wowed by the next version so much because it's so much better than this version because they backtracked it or if I don't know like throttling access and we're not really getting that for like I don't know what it is with something change and it is not as good right it's not precise but just stupid people started using it with us and therefore they make it dumber yeah but I will send you to your windows user what your windows user oh no you're windows can Good or so or no? No, I haven't.
00:40:02 - Dan’s iPhone
I use I have I've had both a parallel Huh? Do you parallels? Can you run windows on Mac?
00:40:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know. I don't I mean I don't have it set up like that What is parallels?
00:40:16 - Dan’s iPhone
It's not like it's so later. Yeah So Nvidia has their own gpt And it's like we started using the yesterday, so I won't send it to you unless it's good But it's it's called like Something like chart RX, so it's like specifically for dealing with data So I gave I had Eric install parallels and that yesterday and then he uploaded like all of Mark's blog posts and we gave it 40,000 records and Now I want to query that data set and say Tell me every city California city that is mentioned in these 40,000 posts, and then see how it does. And then I because I really just need the city names, and I'm like, how the hell am I going to get these across 40,000 posts?
00:41:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:41:12 - Dan’s iPhone
And then see how it does, and then be like, all right, now tell me the frequency of those cities, then be like, Hey, me what counties are mentioned. But I guess first, I don't know if have to teach it first, like, Hey, here are all the California cities and counties, that's easy to get. Well, we're going to see, but then it's also like, we're going to feed it the categories that SEO people created. And we're going to say, All right, anywhere. It's actually hard to do this. But what I wanted to do at the end is spit back out the CSV, and then add a column for categories, and then give it like, if there's a city make that a category, if there's a county make down a category, and then I'll prioritize the category. or the blog post category is for lack of a better term. And then I'd say if any of the blog post categories exist, you're allowed to add two. I don't want any more than four categories for any post. So you can add two by priority. if hit and run were the number one priority and hit and run was there, you'd use hit and run. And then whatever, right? And see if it can do that because we need, I need four categories applied to every blog post across 40,000 posts. All right. I'd like doing that manually. So let's see. But chat TPT borked, I thought I could even read the sheet.
00:42:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm interested to see. I mean, so is NVIDIA stuff using OpenAI?
00:42:54 - Dan’s iPhone
I actually don't know. I just stumbled on it. Just one of those weird random things, like an all of a sudden. two days later, I'm like, oh, we can do this. It's like, I wasn't looking for it. I don't know why it came into my purview, my view, well, whatever. There's another one too. There's one called, I don't think it's gonna be good for this, it's called base.ai. And it allows you to launch your own serverless agents, I think, is, I thinking that might be for something else. Then my buddy is like all into like just building your own rag environment, like on your computer and just running into LLM locally.
00:43:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Rag environment?
00:43:44 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I forget what it stands for, but that's the thing. you set up a rag, and we're going to there.
00:43:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, I'm- It's generation.
00:43:53 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I'm not going down that road at all.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I actually wanted to have like You can. Good night. server but I don't the thing is it's not like a there's two ways to look at it in one way it's not a great use of time because it's tedious and long there's a huge learning curve it'll take a while but on the other end of it the what we know about it and and what it and this goes back to kind of my whole generalist approach to business anyway is that my speed of implementation with whatever comes out will be so much faster and more leverage because I will have an internal understanding of how it works and also when it comes down to like cost and customization being able to have something on a server level and then also privacy to have your own server like and I think that that's going to be really important and I think that anyone I think that at that kind of privacy and having our own servers is going to be more commonplace than it's ever been before because of that's the biggest thing right now right is having everybody's data accessed all the time and how that's used. Did you see there was a there's these kids from Harvard that made and they connected their meta glasses to chat GBT and they built a program that would scan faces of people they are looking at and be able to pull up their name address phone number and all that kind of identification of course yeah I mean we knew that going to happen soon but that is already here like that's the thing and that's what we know about.
00:45:53 - Dan’s iPhone
Did you see Elon's robot that they just put out yesterday? Duke, people having a conversation with it. It's frightening. It's frightening. Like, oh my God, it sounds like a person. Like, it's way beyond what I thought it would be. oh, okay. And he's like, this is gonna be the best song product we ever make. Like, okay. I mean, we can it. I'm full on like, Rhonda by Tesla because they are not a car company. Period.
00:46:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not a car company. No, van.
00:46:33 - Dan’s iPhone
I just see Robo van. Have you seen that? Oh, yeah. think you're up.
00:46:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. The truck's getting rocks.
00:46:41 - Dan’s iPhone
The taxi. Yeah, it was a taxi to van and the robot or the piece of the rolled out yesterday.
00:46:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is crazy how fast, like our sci-fi movies are coming. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the thing about pacing, though. is it's always been faster than well it's not always been faster like but but it is now faster than people think it is but but the the rate of increase is way faster than anybody thinks it's going to be yeah because of the compounding effect and all the brains working not necessarily together but they are all being able to pull from other people's learning curves and technology like there's so much access to a hive via the internet but also the worldwide networks of people who know people that's never existed before like it does now no no and my buddy is always like he thinks everyone should have their own like personal AI that's like really built around their data set that's sort of like what you were saying a minute ago and I ever
00:48:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Every day, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's, I could see where that would be helpful. And especially if you could have it sort of use your local data set and then also be tapping into the LLM, right? it's like, oh, and maybe you prioritize like I want, you know, consider this data source first and then if there's something missing, then go out.
00:48:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and the, anybody that understands if this, then that logic will do really well because it's conditional logic that those things need to go with, right? If this does not, and if not this, then this, that type of thing. And there are a lot of brains that don't do that. There are a lot of that do, but percentage wise, most of them don't. so the opportunity for all these micro markets around AI exists and the, and I'm not had this thought before, but thinking about it now, that's where competition will still be is because it's the same way. Basically, it'll be like the same reason why one particular flavor, one person's particular flavor of voice would draw them to their business coaching over, let's say, Tony Robbins or some other big corporate mega name, right? would be the same reason somebody would buy that lower level AI because whatever, just that whole kind of nuance of personal connection and voice match and things like that. Anyway, interesting or fascinating, but to the point of the server, like I have these machines, but none of them are fast enough and I want to get it, but it's been so long since I've built a machine and know the components and I'd have to upgrade the motherboard and I'm like, oh, do I really want to do this? I wish I could just get one of my kids, like, train No, but there you've got their own interest and they're not here. So like here like in that interest. Anyway, oh, speaking of kids, how's Abel and doing?
00:50:11 - Dan’s iPhone
You text here and there text to her today.
00:50:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She respond when I saw she read it. And yeah, somebody's going to teach her how to turn that off.
00:50:24 - Dan’s iPhone
I thought she did. I think she did in our group chat, but she didn't turn it off and but yeah, well, it's positive.
00:50:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She doesn't turn it off. Probably a good thing. She's adjusting. Well, she doesn't, but it's hard.
00:50:41 - Dan’s iPhone
How's Denise?
00:50:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's fine.
00:50:44 - Dan’s iPhone
She's just, which Mary was the one like Mary was just getting. You know, your kids self diagnosed themselves with mental problems. Yes. What is up with that? Like, I don't understand this generation.
00:51:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no. Oh, it's not just the generation, but it's the access that they have. So it's been a phenomenon in medical students since the beginning, where if they read about symptoms, then they can add, yeah, yeah, in fact, in my classes every year, they warn us like, don't think you have this just because you read it, because that's what everybody does and don't freak out. Oh, and yeah, so it's just that they've got so much access to this information that it happens. They see themselves in this thing. And what they don't realize is the nuance of it and the overlap and all these other conditions again, if this than that type of thing, but there's this also need to feel like we're seen and understood or to give meaning or logic to emotions that we have. And so when you find a label that seems like it fits, now you've feel like you have some understanding. And so that's the logic behind it, like, oh, okay, I understand this now. And also, I'm not accountable. not my fault.
00:52:12 - Dan’s iPhone
So she's going through this series of self-diagnoses. And it's like she's literally trying to find one that we'll ascend to. And then because then the natural step after that is to go talk to your therapist. And we're like, okay, but first she had ADD. And I'm like, you do not have ADD. hate to break it to you, but like, you're born with that. And it would have shown up way before 16 and PS.
00:52:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
nothing, girls.
00:52:48 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, she doesn't have it. Like there's nothing ADD about you at all, at all. But it's like you can sit there and draw for hours on end. literally hours. I'm like, 80 people cannot do that. then she was like, and she's like, well, I don't have the HD part. I'm like, well, there you go. Now you're reading definitely too much. Then that turned into, then she started saying, I can't sit still. going crazy. can't sit still. Like, yeah, no. Okay. You literally can't sit still. You don't say you can't sit still. It's like you'd be bouncing around the river together. Then it was stress. Okay, well, what's stressing you out? And then she liked that one. And now she's sad all the time, mostly.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, yeah.
00:53:43 - Dan’s iPhone
And I'm like, what are you doing? So then she keeps, she won't say it to me because, you know, I'll be like, try to solve it. And then with Denise, Denise is like, well, I could find like a Catholic counselor. And why does that have to be Catholic? Why does it have not have to be? it's like, do you want a counselor or not? So now it's going to be a specific one, which one? Which one should it be?
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If you know so much.
00:54:09 - Dan’s iPhone
So, yeah.
00:54:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's hard.
00:54:13 - Dan’s iPhone
It was homeschooling. At some point, she wanted to be homeschooled and that went away. It's like, okay.
00:54:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. I had one that she got her GED last year and, but she was, talk a class through everything, math, science, all that stuff. Then you get to high school and a lot of the teachers just are spazs. They're not even good at what they do. Sometimes they're dumber than my girls. They're poor leaders. It gets really frustrating. And then you're dealing with all these other students that have poor parenting, poor hygiene, not that intelligent. Like, it's just such a, you nothing out. in the world is like high school and it's it's rough while everybody's got volatile hormones and their brains are going through all these different changes their emotions they're not getting enough sleep and school starts super early even though their circadian rhythms are jacked up at this time it's fun it's lots of fun yeah yeah um okay let me so uh so you can't run any ads still at all is that what you're I cannot run ads in four accounts but the other ones that have the same payment profile well perfectly fine but how many are those oh i don't know like it's there you know there's a bunch of old accounts that i don't even use anymore but um so probably like three maybe and i don't want to
00:56:00 - Dan’s iPhone
I them because I'm like, I don't want to mess with those accounts and I don't want to mess with, you know, these are none of these are connected to another 71, luckily. And they're, you know, my opinion profile isn't connected to marks. So I was like, I don't want to, I don't know why this is happening. don't understand why it's happening. My account is approved and it has been for years. like, something's off somewhere. Maybe it was because I I don't know why. don't know why. I think it's associated with one and they're applying it to the other is what I think is going on. Yeah.
00:56:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you're like, sorry.
00:56:40 - Dan’s iPhone
No, I just don't know what's going on.
00:56:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're, um, so you were saying like last week or Monday, I think you said you got that new ad rep and you sent them a bunch of stuff, but then you're like, they keep changing. So is, do you have somebody working on it for you?
00:56:59 - Dan’s iPhone
Supposedly right now. It's more deep the ad rip from six months ago. That's the only one that responded. No one else is responding. I'm sure it'll go into Google speed, which is not found.
00:57:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. This is the the the the the time of it's not what you know but who you know kind of thing.
00:57:27 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. That's why I jumped into my emails. was like, well, like they contacted me.
00:57:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can't like them.
00:57:34 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. I just think it's hilarious that the one that just got assigned to me and specifically is assigned to D&D as a respondent.
00:57:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we found out that so my guy had they got shut down and he went through all of his contacts to find an old connection that I get like you out like had or maybe like you I don't remember how nothing to do with that particular one but anyway Well, what somebody told him who shouldn't have said anything was that it it appeared to be competitor causing problems That got them shut down that's the thing so like Google Amazon and Facebook They own the majority of the media space and we're in election time where the space is like More valuable and I don't know what the overlap is like because there's only So much ad space on any particular thing and does that like does not related info Take up space like is that a reason I don't know but competitors for sure like Amazon like there That's this whole thing and That's even more reason why the who we know like you have lots of conversations with people Knowing who can help you on any of the the Media platforms cuz cuz all it would take would be for somebody Who competes with another 71? to get you guys shut down like playing a dirty game that's totally possible and And Like what do you do after that? They you're so much And that's to also why diversifying traffic sources is going to be so important diversifying and then Maintaining the most powerful relationships you can where it comes to The the main media sources, which is almost impossible, but it doesn't mean But and you know what happens synergistically Divinely universally whatever, you set that intention and things become more possible. that's, that's the dirty game that we are all at risk of is that if we, if the business is dependent upon ads from one of those big three where you can get shut down for anything, you don't know what it is, they won't tell you, you can't get a hold of a real person. There's no rhyme or reason or logic behind it.
01:00:28 - Dan’s iPhone
Like if that's the bread and butter of your business, you're screwed.
01:00:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:32 - Dan’s iPhone
Anyway, lovely, colorful thoughts.
01:00:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
having this week. Holy , like you could just destroy a huge company. I will, I guess it's not really huge like when you think about it, but it's not but still there's like a few families that are dependent upon it. I guess it's not really huge. It is to the average person who's like millions of dollars.
01:00:58 - Dan’s iPhone
Wow, you know, when they're
01:01:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that these platforms have been, yeah, like with all the crap that we've gone through with Wolfer for on brain tree, like brain tree doesn't give a about the account.
01:01:13 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, give a . They're the that they've essentially like crippled.
01:01:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They would have been out of business. We didn't switch the stride.
01:01:21 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah. It's taken weeks and get it's still not done. It's unreal. And then brain trees shut down, reset you, just shut them down. And I was like, really? Locked up their money, shut them down, and said it was because they were selling supplements. Where? Where are there supplements for sale on this site? And then there's, and it's our decision is final.
01:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Don't bother writing back.
01:01:50 - Dan’s iPhone
Wow. Your decision is based on nothing. It's final. Okay, sounds great.
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so always having another option and back door, but like, how do you do that? How do you, like, how do you have a secondary option that's even comparable to GMB?
01:02:07 - Dan’s iPhone
You don't, you don't.
01:02:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's crazy. Yeah.
01:02:13 - Dan’s iPhone
But, but I think, but I mean, I mean, problem there is that, but like, their entire business, like what, that's like with Mark three years ago, Mark last monkey three years ago, he was up .
01:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's great. Yeah.
01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone
Not so much.
01:02:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It made me think about, though, the strategy between car accident claim center is like, what if you have two and you'd have to run them on completely different accounts, probably using a VPN, completely different IPs, completely different business names, like, is all the separation you could possibly have. And one is branded traffic and one is non branded traffic, just in case, and maybe to help mitigate, doesn't mean that they won't be you're out and shut you down, but um.
01:03:03 - Dan’s iPhone
Oh, yeah, yeah, totally. Yeah, you wouldn't want to mix, especially the other one works for both work. You want them separated. That's why I'm gonna, I want to copy the valiant thing through a different domain. So it's like, oh, I'm gonna use similar domain, but it's different.
01:03:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's the. Anyway, that's that's the thing that we have to be thinking about is what is what is the. It's not the variable, but but what diversity can we create even within the environment as a a backdoor, kind of not a backdoor option, but just a backup option that maybe isn't as powerful, but still. And honestly, maybe it is a data on a traffic plan. Like you have kind of like this parallel business that looks like the whole point of it is, you know, generating traffic for multiple businesses and you're selling leads, but really it's a if everything hits the fan I'm funneling all those leads to my own business. I don't know You don't want to fund your competitors, but Maybe sell the data to somebody who's not competing But still interested in relative data. I Don't know what that looks like, but either way, I feel like that's the chess move is to Know that traffic can get shut down. And so how do you have a backup traffic source on the same platform? That could be redirected to an existing business if it got shut down and maybe it's not the same amount of volume, but it keeps you from like going from Everything to zero and maybe you only lose like 50% of it or something While you work it out Yeah, I mean that's extremely difficult to do on google for sure Um, that's like Is it this this business was?
01:05:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that dependent on that one source.
01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Yeah. It was the thing that blew it up.
01:05:08 - Dan’s iPhone
Right. And it's also the thing that blew it up in both directions.
01:05:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. But it's because of the nature of the business that it's the kind of thing that people go and get local reviews. So, and they were all tied to this one account. So it's definitely a learning lesson. Um, but it, but it, the growth was explosive and fast. And so was a shutdown, although, but it did get turned back on, but it was, it was crazy. Um, this whole thing again, back to pace of the evolution. It's, it's hard to, you have to be consciously thinking about the pace and the potential change and the potential destruction at all times to be able to be even remotely prepared for things happening because apathy. for even like a month or a few months could put you in a situation where something happened and like you took your eye off the ball and that the ball is your building up against this platform yes and you don't control any of it right totally yeah anyway all right well sir that's Friday huh oh how was how was mom time yesterday it was good i mean she's definitely like she was like who's your who's your sister who who's your person i go who's my person i know you have a secretary i go no who helps you i go stacy i'm going to reach out to stacy and tell her to put bomb lunch once a month in your calendar i said she'll do it i'm going to i'm going to reach out to her i don't know she really will she might we'll see um so she clearly wants that and then we went and visited my
01:07:00 - Dan’s iPhone
dad and he is oh man he is so much worse i was like he didn't remember anybody like any any of other than like the immediate family like he thought his brother was dead his only brother that's alive he thought he was dead and then he couldn't he didn't know my cousin sadly my cousin just passed away like last week and he didn't know who she was who's kid michelle who's michelle your brother's daughter what brother Paul Paul Paul has a daughter like Paul has two daughters he does i don't remember that but that was the interesting thing is he kept saying i don't remember that i don't remember that then he didn't remember he didn't remember his other brother's son who has the same name i was like are you talking about Jackie and you write so the That's Jack and the son's Jackie and what are you talking about Jackie? Who's Jackie? I'm like, Jack's son. I don't remember that. Is Jack have kids? Other kids were like, no. he goes, is he the oldest? And we're like, no. Like the fourth. And so I like, oh boy. And then he didn't like, didn't remember Lisa. He thought Lisa had a job somewhere. I don't know where he thought she worked, but he didn't remember that. He thought that my brother's garage, where he lived, was not remodeled. He's like, I want to go finish that.
01:08:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
want to go.
01:08:37 - Dan’s iPhone
I think we should build that out. We're like, it's filled out. He's like, no, no, I mean, like, put up insulation, put in wallboard. No, dad, that's all we're done. They put in wallboard? Who? We're like, okay. So, and then when we left, my mom's like, he is so much worse than the last time I was here. I was like, really? She goes, yeah, it's a. A lot of work seems to get open, which I thought.
01:09:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, this seems worse. Does your mom have, like, good friends?
01:09:10 - Dan’s iPhone
No, doesn't. Like, she did. The woman across the street, they were, like, besties. then she passed away. So there's one. And then her nephew moved in. He just moved out because he couldn't afford to live in California anymore. So that was dated. So David's gone. So all she's got is my brother. And then my brother's hilarious, right? she got that operation. So like, they're living together, which is going to be a lot. So she told me, I got a lot of my brother for this. So she'll come out and start talking to him, and he'll just look at her and go, Mom, it's quiet time right now. And then I go, what do you do? She goes, I go back into my room, sick. I'm like, that's a very nice way of putting it. She's like, no, I respect it like he's, you know, he's come. been working all day. You got to be on it.
01:10:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, she's a mom, so she probably gets that, but.
01:10:07 - Dan’s iPhone
Yeah, I mean, she's very much still with it, right? she's still very sharp, and it's like, OK, yeah, she can't drive, right? So she just lost that. And then, you know, she does, the Ubers are so expensive. And then she's been trying to find an alternative to Uber. then they're all ludicrous. It's like, there's this other service. It's a minimum $150. It's three hours, minimum three hours, $150. And then they're a nurse. And she's like, I don't need a nurse. I just need like a sidekick. But how would you even like provide a service like that, right? have to do background check on these people, like, you know. So yeah, how much?
01:10:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is she like interested in retirement community at all?
01:10:57 - Dan’s iPhone
No. Well, then another. money, right? All the money is going to my debt. Yesterday, she literally said this. She was like, we'd all be better off if I died. And I was like, that's where you're at. And she's like, well, it would just make things easier. And she's like, you know, then he'd get all the money, and then he'd get even more money because I passed away. And she's like, this is eventually going to like, I'm eventually going to run out of money. And I like, well, do you don't have to worry about it until that happens. No, I don't think that's the problem. Like, it's not where she's living.
01:11:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's like, how do you?
01:11:41 - Dan’s iPhone
Well, love me. You're gonna be thinking about it right now. It's like, kind of be some sort of thing network thing that you can tap into where they come pick you up. Like, it's gonna be some sort of group affair. Yeah.
01:11:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, if you look at longevity, the people that live the the longest longest are the people.
01:12:00 - Dan’s iPhone
that live in multi-generational houses and have basically like open door policies and people visit each other a lot and she's like super at that because the joke was we should just get you in a joining room here she's like I'm not I'm not moving into a place like this and I think she just means in general like she doesn't want to live but she would literally arrive because she everybody loves her and she everyone times she was she's the one that like it's like she has an invisible couch that she takes around and they lay down on it and just spill their guns she would you'd go into the store to get like a loaf of bread you know pick a milk and she'd come out with like someone's life story I'm like oh my god you were only in there what is that making it be like take care of other people for a little bit each week or could you do this just for three months or six
01:13:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
once or whatever and frame it like she's there to help other people which would be true because what she did she was a nurse that was right but but that's what I'm saying but like maybe she needs it to be positioned as this is a thing that you need to go do for other people could you go do this for other people for a little while and just because like they're lonely they need help and they don't have anybody who will do it because everybody's busy and up in their own world but and then maybe she just finds what she needs because we all especially women like men do too many projects that are things and women need projects that are people and yeah so the other thing she can't do right now is because of this recovery from the surgery right so right now it's literally just about like she just needs interaction outside of my brother i think she's but she can't get it because she's homebound really
01:14:00 - Dan’s iPhone
Come on, better turn. Luckily, she's got the dog. The dog does help. They never had a dog. We never had a dog run up. She loves this dog. The dog's the best, Aw.
01:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Man, I can't turn off mom mode, but I also can't turn off daughter mode and sister mode and all that other stuff. And it just breaks my heart, like, how much loneliness is in the world when there's like, but everybody's not everybody's lonely. But like, so many people are lonely. I'm like, you know, you guys could solve that if you would just, like, spend time with each other. Right. anyway, okay, I will be quiet.
01:14:38 - Dan’s iPhone
I will let you go.
01:14:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wait, I don't know if we're talking to Mark Monday. I will check on that, because he is on vacation. But I know how he is. He pretty much doesn't have our council air calls. I will check. And then I will let you know if there's any change. Otherwise, we will soon. I will talk to you Monday.

Mm-hmm.
00:01:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm-hmm.
00:01:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So... Hold on. Speaking of my brain. How is my brain? Okay. Actually, it probably really helps me to look at my notes and stay focused when my brain wants to go thing, thing, It's been a productive week, but the problem is I've got all those billions of things in my head. Oh, okay. So, just little by waiting on Stacey for some, actually, she probably sent me a reply in the hand.
00:01:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I actually know. He... You're probably not on it, but he started talking to Mark. He needed Mark to do some stuff, so Mark and him are getting in touch with each of the vendors. So, I think Mark gave him a contact at every vendor, so that Josh could be like, hey, I needed to do it like this. As far as, like, sending... I think the state names or whatever you think that they'll all comply. Oh, yeah That'd be good. Um, I I I love that you feel Josh I love when Dan goes down rabbit holes and comes up with a like gold nugget dude that the guy sawed that I found to do the high-level stuff is I Love him because he just gets it done Andy makes it better like Josh I'd have referred to them. It's like JD funnels or whatever, but they were the dudes I hired to make The custom I bought their custom value updater, but then subsequently they built like The Spotify app and then they built they just built another thing that they released I got a test Tuesday meeting with them tomorrow. He's releasing another thing so I'm making All these customizations to high level with them. They're super cheap, super fast, and he always makes it better. Like this, I love these. They have a four or four page from the front is the code. Great idea. Noria is pretty good, like it works.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They have five, oh, I don't know what trust index.io is. Nevermind, I thought that was a trust pilot. I was like, they have 24 or five star reviews on, but it's not trust pilot. So, dude, I don't wanna check that out. It's gonna go ahead a little. So, cause I'm thinking, you know, business 101, diversification, and just lots of different little things. Number one, because I get bored if I stay on the same thing all the time. But, So all things kind of feed each other as long as they're relative. Um, but I like having the agency, it's basically affiliate level stuff. But anyway, having, I want to have a smallish go high level kind of package offering that has the built kind of some basic automation, basic templates, things like that, that is just a side offering, like it's not the main thing. It's just a, cause the monthly fee is not that much. to break even, and if I had a regular amount of traffic coming in with people who are interested in business development topics, there's going to be a portion of those that will want that. So anyway, just thinking about it.
00:04:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it all depends on who you're talking about.
00:04:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For sure. For sure. But since this is going to be my My baby basically, for a few years, because my babies are grown, I get a lot of exploring to do, and yeah, anyway, okay, so what features, oh, the report functions just down here, oh, that was Mark, Robert, I needed to leave myself good notes. Oh, okay, and high level, I was about like, does your, because we were talking, I should probably go to Fathom, so it didn't take good notes, and that's what my note taker is for, but about what mom needs, because we were asking, I was asking questions, and there was too many, I don't know.
00:05:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Stop it, oh my gosh.
00:05:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Please, yeah. which is the right one, that's not the right one, where's my Dan called? September 19th, and it seems like forever ago, and also too soon. Um, well, once you get your win, okay. This is not a very good summary, project update, center, retrospective. They have all these different summaries, and some of them are good. But some of them, none of them great, that's the bottom line. Anyway, um, these are the things that I wrote down. What features does Mark want? What functions do you want? And what are the most important things that need to happen for your artist? And I know it was talking, oh, circle. You were going into circle in membership groups. That's what the question was about.
00:06:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But you decided to circle. I decided. on Circle for Mom, I don't know that I think it's too cost-prohibitive for solo artists at certain levels. But it's like, okay, we build ours on there. There is a lower tier, you know, $49 a month version. I don't know what the other dudes that I mentioned charged, but I mean, it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood. Or they're getting a rip. Maybe they're getting they got to be charging something. The pricing's not on their site, of course. So it's like, let's be honest, someone has one or two songs out. The last thing they should be, this is my argument, to mark all the time. It's like, dude, we do not want to create jobs for these people. So if their job is releasing songs, not managing their community. So at some point, it might make sense based on the volume of fans to have a community and then to manage that community or pay someone to manage that community. But if you're just starting out, like, we need to figure out, like, hey, when you're this tier artist, if you're starting out and you're getting all their email addresses, you can start a community whenever you want, right? don't need to start it. Step one is build that asset of an email list, which is what they do with family. And then you could then coach them into, like, hey, when you get to this level, you might want to think about starting a community. And here's what looks like, go sign up for circle, potentially, right? Or maybe high levels is at a place where it will work for that. I actually got a response from the high level of devs about, like, customizing it. So, but it's not going to work. The reason it doesn't work for Mark is because you can't embed mp3s. And I'm like, which makes sense. It's like, what poor sky is really embedding an mp3? No. So, that that's sort of the key component of why it doesn't work at the moment. So it's like, okay, we'll either go get around to it, and then we'll just change the advice. Oh yeah, no, just use hours and then unless and until you just direct them towards circle. But again, I don't think we need determine who should have a community. Like Sean's band should have a community, right? On has 400,000 subscribers on Spotify. On gets, you know, millions of, he has over 60 million streams on Spotify, but Sean's also the cobbler's kid and has refused. So it's like, he's not doing all the things that are right in front of him. But his band and an example of one that probably should have a community, right? He's on tour. He's releasing singles consistently now. He hadn't been, but he's doing almost all the things right now, except for the fan flow he did.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So we capture things here sometimes that I don't know how it I think I don't know that you remember it to take it back to anybody to turn it into a task like do you have a task for mom would there be a place to put the the highlights of these conversations where you're exploring some things kind of almost like bullet points that you might not otherwise like what are the criteria for who should have a community it doesn't have anything to do with following size releases like I've literally never said that before right so that's the thing is I like rather than it doesn't do me any good just to know how to keep it how do we what would be the best way to put this somewhere where it goes into additional conversations with them or yourself
00:11:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
the team to uh so first off that's fan flowy that would not be mom um this is fan flow yeah yeah so and then uh you could so you could send it to Stacy and be like hey this is this is for the Monday call okay right so we talked to him every Monday um so yeah that's probably the best case of it so she'd be like hey here's this thing he you know damn brought this up make sure to bring this up on the Monday call because he he'll forget which is 1000% true because mark and then come with the list and we come with nothing so now we're going to come with a bit of a list or maybe we have access to their list maybe maybe if she gets access to the list and we have us we centralized the list that they're using i don't even actually know oh they're doing They come with a list every week.
00:12:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Of things to talk about?
00:12:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I don't know where that list lives. It's certainly not in teamwork. Even the mark made us set everything up on teamwork. And maybe it should be in teamwork.
00:12:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I think that Stacey can help with the structure of that. But I don't think anybody will help you dig into it.
00:12:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, that's a question for Mark. It's not a question.
00:12:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But Stacey can ask it or remind you, whatever. So here's what I did was just said, like, I've got a fan flowy section. And then at Stacey, the above note. could you bring it up on the Monday call? So she brings up, how does Mark bring a list of stuff to talk about on the call? He has one, where does it live?
00:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Should we get that into teamwork? That's what I wrote. Yeah.
00:13:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
she brought that up mission accomplished, right?
00:13:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You guys would figure it out from there? Yeah, and then we have to bring up the other bit that specific bit like, what is the criteria for someone? Maybe it's not for everyone. Right. shouldn't be teaching people that. Right. So it's like, just like we're not going to promote it as part of employee, because it doesn't live in pamphlets. So it's, although I don't think we were planning on promoting that.
00:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and what I have there is what I read, which is need to determine who should have a community. Yeah. They aren't for everyone. How big should your following be? What are the other criteria releasing consistently? her question, Mark, like, anything else that you come up with, but that will spark that conversation so that you get some guardrails, basically. on what's being created, and some definition, and some structure.
00:14:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Good to me.
00:14:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, and then... So, is there a community that... I was talking about what marked me, done what you need in terms of community. Is there a community that is joining between you two? Is it for mom?
00:14:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is it something separate? Yeah, mom is the... Imagine that like, mom is like the umbrella, and it's like... So, fan flow is a service of mom. If we do this distribution thing, so there's this idea of doing distro flowy, that would be a service of mom, while we're flowy, service of mom. Just then it's like these flowies, right, exist over here. And then mom would also have potentially this idea of... well, not potentially. So then mom would also have like, hey, the book is from mom, it's not from time blowing. So this, it's the independent artist compass guide to, you know, navigating your musical success and like that. So the book is like the, the D lead magnet, right? That's like the Maria lead magnet for lack of better term. And then so I make my plan is to make the low ticket funnel with the book on the front end. And then the book has, it's, it's the book is promoting mom and fan flowy, right? In the actual text. But mom has the community. So we're giving away the checklist or we're giving away. So the book has like, she just did this. And it just made this number up. has like nine checklists or nine worksheets, summer checklist, so we're not so we'll come worksheets. It has nine worksheets in theory. Each one of those worksheets could be a lead magnet. I don't I don't think the L.R., but for sure, the royalties one that we've already used has worked, and then the release one that we've already used has worked, and then there are two others we could test or we don't need to, but they're integrated into the book, but they're also going to be these standalone lead magnets. What I did before was I ran ads to the thing, brought them into Lee Flowey into mom and Lee Flowey, and then I was distributing the thing via email from there, but as part of...
00:16:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
When you say lead flowey, when it's music related, it's always fan flowey.
00:16:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Is that correct? No, it was Lee Flowey literally at the time. Now mom will be inside of fan flowey, but it was literally in lead flowey. There was no fan flowey.
00:16:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how long ago it was. did this last summer.
00:16:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was getting leads for under two box and I think what I did was they they it was a Facebook messenger at I think it was a messenger or a lead and I forget which to high level and then it maybe was a landing page somewhere in somewhere in there I don't know where it was exactly but I can look it up I asked them if they wanted to join the Facebook community and and I need to go back now just for my own nerdiness and be like what was the uptake rate on community so I actually don't remember but what we're seeing with these fans of this one dude is doing the community thing for this one band and the uptake rate on people joining the community is like over 50% which is interesting so here what I want to do is like deliver the thing through the community so it's be like oh okay here you know so in the Gary, get them in the high level and then according to my circle guy, I can zap over that to circle creating the common circle for them and then send them that be like, Hey, here's where you here's where you can go. know, you're in the community and that's where you get your thing. Or maybe they don't if they don't join the community I just send them the thing and then I try to enjoy the community one of the other. So the mom community is going to be comprised of in theory, musical artists, engineers, producers, music makers. Let's put that way. Thus make our music. So that community is like the shared community and then there will be courses in there potentially that we sell them into all that good stuff, but also from there. don't think I've talked to you about this, but ideally, I think the play is to like build a community and then try to do equity. crowd funding on top of it. We're like, okay, yeah, we're making our own music and now we're making our own label. And you can all be part owners of that. And then raise do equity crowd funding through like we funder or there's another one start engine. And there's rules, right? I think you can only raise like three million the first round, yada yada yada. But you're literally raising, raising, doing a capital raise through non-accredited investors, because it's this thing that came up during Trump. And some people are raised, gives millions of dollars doing it. But the trick is supposedly you build the community first. And then you tap into that community. So I'm like, okay, we have all the pieces to build the community. And then we just need to work out the model. think about some of the model that we know sort of the model is fan plowing, then the coaching would be on top of that. We don't have any date on that. And then this idea of buying catalogs, like I think I talked to you about that, Sean's catalog is for sale. You buy the catalog, and then the third bit would be to actually like sign an artist and do a rev share where you're getting a piece of royalties. then the final bit is this distribution, distribution revenue stream. So basically, if you, we wipe label this distribution service, and then we would tell our people that when you release a song, use Distroploid, when you get a rip of every song that gets released through your software. It's very tiny. But if you've got hundreds of thousands of songs getting released through it, it adds up. I've got to sort a map out. And I started doing a little bit yesterday, like map out how all the revenue was. He may be going to exist and then we start to fill in the blags like, okay, we're making this much on SaaS, we're making this much on Coaching and label services and we're making or this much on forces We're making this much on label services, which is like a done with you tier And then we're making this much as a label, which is done for you tier where you're potentially Putting money into the production of the song and therefore you're you're acting like a label Except our deal is not going to be a label deal. Like so With Sean, I did not understand this until he told me when Sean signed with AF AFM They get a hundred percent of his catalog. They own it And he gets no streaming revenue Why did he do that? That's how labels work. So what the benefit for them was that that they open up the door to them touring in Europe. So I don't think he's in a 360 deal. have to confirm this. But a 360 deal, if you don't know, means these are newer. A 360 deal means they get a piece of everything, streaming, merch, I don't think he's in a 360 deal. I think he's in more of a traditional deal. And that's like the catalog. merch and tour, they have no part of and they gave them money that he has to pay back, right? So and they're not that payback is not happening through his streaming revenue, right? So it's not like, hey, it's 50-50 and then we're taking 100% until you pay us back and then you get 50%. They have no percent. AFM owns the entire catalog. So they, did I not tell you this?
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.

They recently approached Sean and I don't know what to do. He tells, I still have to get them. But it sounds like the heads of the label that signed Lansdowne left, whether it was amicable or not. I don't know. The new people went to Lansdowne were basically like, we don't want you guys anymore. So we will sell your catalog back to you for $250,000 or something like that.
00:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow.
00:23:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And they don't have the money. So they came to me and said, do you want to buy Lansdowne? I was like, really? What does that look like? What it looks like? And I might be wrong about the $250. But it's in the neighborhood. What it looks like is currently Lansdowne makes between $8,000 and $10,000 a month on Spotify, which AFM takes all that. So I buy Lansdowne catalog. I get 100%. I instantly start getting paid $8,000 a month. But then obviously it would be here with me. like, you guys should really be using fan flow.
00:24:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:24:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
You guys should really be using all these tools, right? But I would instantly start making 10 grand a month, let's say, plus whatever increases they see, because now they are going to tour, they are, they're headlining a tour in Europe in the fall. And what they told me is like, oh, there's other bands that you could go by their whole catalog just like that. And then put them in the mom machine, help them put out new songs, help them, you know, harness what they've already got. And then you, you own all the streaming, or whatever deal, whatever the deal is. And Sean's scenario is all about it. So I was like, oh, that's interesting. Actually, so I just told someone about that. I just told Salco. And he was like, wait, what?
00:24:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right? He's like, that is, okay. I get some money.
00:24:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Go with it. He's like, we need to know the exact numbers, but he's like, I'm going to run it. He's got this buddy who's like this baller lawyer. And he's like, get the details and I'll run it by Ryan. But he's like, dude, I'll throw money into that. Right? I was like, yeah, no. So, and then they had like two other bands that they know of that you could do it with. But there's tons of them. That's the thing, right? So when you look at them buying Elton John's catalog, this is just a smaller version of that. Right. But those guys are never going to go like try to grow Elton John.
00:25:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why would you?
00:25:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. It's a proven asset that just does what it does. Here it's to a degree. It's a it's an asset that can be at least somewhat enhanced. And then the big question is like, you know, it's spotify number one in 10 years. I'd say no, but so you use like a five year window when you're when you're buying these things be like, hey, look, we're not Looking past five years. Yeah, they could they can still be number one. Well, could take it up. Like we don't know what's gonna happen. So this is the price based on that.
00:26:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The to me, the ideal investment is something that's already making money regularly, but totally leveraged because once you leverage it, then it's just compounding, but with really little effort, especially if you have the system.
00:26:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it's all digital.
00:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you don't have to do anything crazy.
00:26:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I was like, yeah, that is so big. Yeah. So it's like, okay, factor that into mom, right? That's a revenue stream with you acquiring acquiring and then leveraging, like you said, and then also just finding an artist that's happening right now, right? They don't have any of that, but then you think they have the potential to build the catalog. Especially if they follow all your systems, right?
00:26:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we have this system, the continuous release strategy.
00:27:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
which is like, hey, you know, you're releasing a song every 8 to 12 weeks. Period. That's your job. You have to make the product. right.
00:27:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's say that the artist didn't do anything and you just use a system to keep them top of mind and get new people to be aware of them. They don't create new content. Just new people discover the music, discover they like it. In three years, you'd get your money back. then after that, it's all profitable. But what we know about music is that when you like it, you like it. So yes, there's new things entering and getting into it. There's that competition. What would be interesting is, is what is the attrition rate of downloads and listens when you don't do anything to promote it? Like what got it there in the first place? What was there? Because if the machine of just you might like this song or the machine of just putting up the clips on social media so that new people are seeing it and discovering it, if that's all you had to do and inexpensively, right, to at least maintain the amount of downloads that happened, the streaming, listens, right, however they call it, then that model just over and over again, even here's what I love about it because normally like if you invest in a business, somebody still has to perform something, business still has to operate, you still have to get new customers but generally that means something that has to be fulfilled, nobody has to fulfill this, this is just a thing, like you have to do something in terms of the system but it's not somebody you can't it's you, it's your system, it's not, you know, it's mostly software for the most part, are automations and just checking the stats and making sure, you know, all the automations and the tech is working the way that it's supposed to. But it's not, because if the model is the success is dependent upon creators creating, writers, writers, singers, and those, you know, music artists, a lot of times, I mean, just created to be dramatic, life happens, they can't perform, they break up blah, blah, all these different things that create this volatility is absent in that model, like that's nuts.
00:29:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, and that's why, like, that's why you would acquire 100%, right? with a new artist, they're going to make money, they're incentivized to keep making music, right? you have a, the split is totally different. And then maybe you're also getting paid back. But if you're, if that's done in the context of it's your engineers, it's your your mixing producers, it's your songwriters, you have them inside this machine and they're not, they don't have to go pay $5,000 to get a song made. You could get a song done really cheap, comparatively. They don't have to go pay to get the video done. You're talking to them, like I'm pugging to Jim about this, like Jim and I were going back for an email and I said, Hey, what's the version of like? So he had mapped out a course like to make your own video and I'm like, dude, they're not going to do it. I'm like, yeah, we can sell the course, sure. Some people will do it, most people won't finish the course. And I was like, what if, what if we just showed them how to make a shot list and then they do the shots and then they submit the videos just to be edited because they're not going to edit it, it's Facebook's. And yeah, so I was like, you could, so then it's like, hey, you get a music video and this is how you shoot it. Like you hear it, get your eyes on. But I waste to change the camera to these settings and storyboard out your thing and then go shoot those and send it to us and we'll edit it. And it's like, um, and then, but then that's for like the done with you artists, right? like, they're not there. You're just helping them. But then they're releasing the song through your platform. You're getting paid on their song because they went through your distribution platform. And so, yeah, it behooves you to help them get the song out, have it do well, but you don't believe enough in them or or it's maybe something you don't believe enough in them. You can't work with everyone. Right. So you have to let the cream rise to the top and then the cream you're going to go, Hey, we want to work with you. And then and then we're going to take over all the things that you're the social media and the data that right we're going to take away the jobs. And then for that, we get this and you get that and we're going to help you, you know, people. more consistent.
00:32:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, what is the structure of like, how does Mark and Jim and Sean and everybody get paid? Like, mom is your company. What does this structure look like?
00:32:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I haven't even said it up yet. So, right now, we're just building fan flowy. I'm funding it, but I haven't really spent very much money at all. And then they're putting in this equity, right? They're building all the stuff with me. The bands that are on it right now, no one's paying a subscription yet, but they're also letting us break their , right? We've definitely screwed up a couple times. But you know what? can screw up when it's free. So, the plan is the stupid spotify app, which is not going to prove to know I'm hopefully in a reason that tomorrow I'm going to get some missing some good book. And I resubmit that. That's probably going to take another eight weeks. Not only knows if we're going to get approved. We have to wait.
00:33:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What was that my daughter wants in right as you said that's getting approved?
00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We need the Spotify app to get approved. That's the missing piece of the MVP. Once that's approved, then we're going to start charging for bamplowy. So I was waiting for the book, which is now done.
00:33:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It is finally done? Yeah, it's done.
00:33:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
They're just writing about author parts. Mark's doing it right now. So the book's done. I'm mapping out all the checklists or worksheets right. I was working on that this morning. I'm going to send those to Greg and have him do one. I can't even do one. then he would look like I might have to do a cover for the book too. But it's mom. So it's going to the bands are paying them a done with you fee. I don't even know what it is, I don't even care, but they're like running the ads for them. And they're like giving them support, they have a Slack support group set up and whatever. So whatever bands are on there that are just paying them like a monthly retainer of some sort to get access to the software and then get access to them to run the ads. So like Johnny's putting up ads every day. But they, you know, it's a grind and it's like not scalable. So the scalable version is DIY and then that and then coaching. what I want to do with the book is like bring people in, show them that it works, put them on fan flowy and then they can, you know, send from there. Hey, want to come with you? you want to come whatever, get them in the community, blah, but the software is like primary. Employees like the real Year the main gear There is no financial partnership structure arrangement at all no those guys love that , and I'm like no We're not incorporating something that doesn't make any money Right, so the the deal is 50 50. I get half they get half That's the that's the deal. That's the understood deal That they brought to me.
00:35:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't care how they distribute their house, right?
00:35:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then I mean I don't I think that to a degree that I don't think they really get it. I don't think Mark understands that like This can be everything that he thinks that he's ever wanted it has the it has I want to say potential, but I'm gonna say it As it has the all the pieces are there, like the puzzle is not together, but it's like the pieces are right in the they just need to slide it over and click it in. Like, yeah, slide it over and click it in. They're not spread out on the table anymore. So that's what he was dealing with before is like the piece, the piece of the puzzle wasn't even on the table. Well, now they're all in the table and some of it's put together and it's like, okay, what do we need to do to click this one in place, right? It's not as simple as picking it up. It's like, all right, what do we need to do that, right? So they're they're all there, but they're not all in place, right? For example, the distribution thing, like they had talked about that and then Sean and Sean found the saying and I talked to them and now that piece is just sitting there and it has not been put in place, but it can be. But there's no point in putting it in place right now. However, the piece has been defined, its location where it needs to go is known about the domain. Like, it's there. we just got to wait to then go click. There's no point putting in a place if nobody's using pamplowing.
00:37:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:37:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just like the community, like I started it, it was working and I stopped it. I said, I'm not building community right now because there's nothing, there's nowhere for them to go. I have nothing to offer these people other than a checklist. That's not enough. And I learned like, okay, I learned what to ask them and I learned, okay, great. Down. Check. Peace is there. It's not in place.
00:37:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, I mean, do you have, I'm just trying to think about Well, the other bit is like, they, I didn't come up with this equity crowdfunding thing until like a month and a half ago.
00:37:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I was like, and I got it from listening to one of Joe's podcasts and turns out, the girl that he interviewed lives here, but now I can go meet her whenever, and you can do a sit-jow up. But once I listened to that, I was like, oh, this fits perfectly. In that context, if you're going to do equity crowdfunding, I guarantee you, you need to have an entity that looks a certain way. So I'm like, great. That's what the entity is going to be based on. It's not going to be based on a distribution of bears or whatever. It needs to be based on the idea of like, hey, let's say I want to go rate is $10 million over time. Great. What does that need to look like? That's not that you're going to go public, but when I have a company right now, it's 50-50. It's me and Denise. I don't know how many F&T shares there are in D&D company, and I don't care, right? But if you're going to equity crowdfunding, that's going to matter. Because you're actually selling shares. So, you know. We had an entity, it would be getting dissolved and reformed with this. So it's like, okay, now it'll be like, hey, I want to build because I think I'm going to put that piece of places. Therefore, this entity piece, I think needs to look like this. And I guarantee you, if we build that and they don't equity crowdfund, it won't hurt us because it was built that way. If it's built in a way to allow equity crowdfund, it's not going to a negative from a distribution or equity standpoint. It'd just be like, oh, you have a hundred thousand shares and it could have been a thousand because, you know, that's what you needed to go equity round or whatever.
00:39:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what do you have defined right now that is what is going to be, if anything, that would be sold, that has a price point where you could do those financial calculations?
00:39:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think Sean has mapped out the SaaS tier pricing. I don't know it offhand. But I believe he did. I think you've done him and Eric were in a setting up. I don't know if it's inside a family, but I think Sean did it. And we're like, I think the low level is like 97 bucks, right? then the coaching and stuff. They I don't know what they're charging, but whatever they are, I would probably raise the price. So I can get that from them. So it be like, what does the done? What is the done with you tier? And what does it look like? And what is the price? And then the done for you would be this label level thing. And you can't really do that. Unless you had more, but I don't. And you can't do it. But like, if you're going to do done for you and you're going to pay to produce someone's song, what is they've done it, right? So Mark and Sean have, you know, after after what they've done. But like, they work that guy, massive man, who's this rapper who PS they're like, he can buy his catalog. So they work with him. I don't know. So with him, I think they worked on a like, and maybe this is maybe there's like a done for you barter thing, where it's like, hey, we're going to come and do a song with you. And we're going to make sure that we can work together, which is essentially what they would do with him. But they only did that because they couldn't like sign him and be like, we're going to do every song with you. But as I say it out loud, and I'm like, maybe it's that. I don't know what that deal looks like. I don't know what, I mean, I know Mark and Sean worked on it and I know they wrote, but I don't know that they actually charged mass anything. They should have. They should have charged him to mix it. They should have charged him to produce an engineer. But I don't know that they did. In this scenario, you would. But what does that look like? Or, yeah, so that that Or that's that's not even done for you. There's that tier to like you could have a tier where you're like I mean, I guess it's done with you production tier There's a done with you marketing tier done with you. Yeah, it's done with you. So then the done for you There should be like some sort of like hey, we're gonna try this out And you're not signing them to a deal. You're signing them to like a single like that Assuming that could be a thing And then you would just take your done with you pricing and say this is what we're investing You're not paying any of this.
00:42:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what we would have charged you down here and for that We're getting 50 percent of this or 50 percent of the streams or whatever it is So If somebody okay, so let's say Dan starts running ads and gets people to the book And the book gets people to lead flowy. would be splitting 50 percent of whatever revenue lead flow we make.
00:43:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I get paid back everything first. So I have to calculate all that which stays and I could do it but I just let me in. So I calculate my total investment, I get paid back 100% first and then we go then it's 50% of net. So then you have to cover any of the ongoing costs, the cost of lead flow, the white label, the cost of whatever it is, right? There'll be different costs, right? If we add the distribution in, that becomes like 900 bucks a month. If we add in this circle, that becomes $300 a month, right? So whatever the 50% of net, I get paid back everything and I'm 50% of that. And then the net's like moving moving item for whatever period.
00:43:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then with, in fan flowy and the services, the sort of done with you and the done for you, those guys are fulfilling stuff and that's what they're doing for their 50%, but you get 50% of that also, is that right?
00:44:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, so the done with you and done for you was like really mom and it's so it's done with you, they'd be on fan flowy, right? it's like, hey, you're using fan flowy. So we won't work with anyone. I think we don't work with anyone that's not even fan flowy. So it's like, you don't, these are even available to you. You can't just come in from the outside. You can come in at this done with you tier, but the first thing you're going to do is start paying for fan flowy because we're not going to help you promote us all or promote yourself if you don't even have this fan after and grow up system in place, right? So done with you, done for you, that's mom level stuff. And in my mind, it's like an ascension out of fan flowy. Well, fan flow is with inside a mom, right? the ground level of mom is like the book and then fan flow is a service and then it kind of goes up from there.
00:45:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So what I'm asking is, is everything under the mom umbrella being split with them 50-50?
00:45:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, yeah. someone came in after the fact, after we have an end of the year whenever all the money would go into a mom account. So they would pay mom right now. They're paying bam rock or whatever. They wouldn't pay them anymore.
00:45:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got it.
00:45:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Or maybe they would keep the ones that they already have and then all the new ones whenever one of the other.
00:45:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. OK, that's more clarity, I think, than I've ever seen. What I'm going to do, a lot of these notes are already structured as is. I think would be really helpful. for Stacy to have so that she can house them somewhere and she's in the meetings.
00:46:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I assume she's in most the meetings. That one, yeah.
00:46:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I met most meetings like with you guys about these topics. Anyway, I'm gonna highlight some stuff. might even make like a tiny little just kind of mind map as a visual starting point for helping facilitate that conversation that you guys will be in so that because you know how it is, we see it, they see it literally same page because now a page exists to be able to look at it. Since you're getting so close to being able to start ads and, um, you so much, um, start ads and, uh, and sending traffic, um, So, but you can't sell stuff you haven't defined and you're building the technical aspect of it. But anyway, you know, the offer and the physical fulfillment are two different things, not that it's physical, it's digital, but you know what I mean. So, it's just bodies are weird, damn, they're just weird and inconsistent and annoying and frustrating. Like if I do the same stuff every single day, then I should get the same type of results. But do you think that that's how it works? No, Dan, that is not how it works. No, it is not. No, not at all. That's okay because I'm a boss at figuring it out and then solving it quickly. I'm just annoyed. have to work so hard at it.
00:47:52 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And it is not a plus.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's not. It's really not. My sister has like the easiest life. She has them. is she's got no issues. She's just like flowing through life, not thinking about nothing. And I'm like, if I don't think about anything, I'm dead. So that's nice. I'm not even being dramatic about it. That's the truth.
00:48:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, it was the truth.
00:48:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right. That's good. Okay, I'm not gonna save my notes yet, because I don't want to trigger the app CC until I'm done with that. How is the Google analytics stuff going?
00:48:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, I jumped in Wednesday and I looked at a number. I can't be right. It's way too high. I gotta go figure out why that's so high. So I think, I don't know, stuff might be double firing. So there's two numbers I looked at. One, I have to confirm, which is my new customer customer variable customer event. So I have to go try to match the that up with meta rick and see if it should match. If it doesn't, then I'm going to circle around a mushi and be like, this is wrong in this way. So if it's over a ronder. Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to get the date that he put it. have that date. But I see if that's working and then they do this past stuff. It's only way you can describe it is like you fire an event on a URL. So like I set up two paths, which are literally our paths, right? So our paths are choose a path, go down a path, go to the product page. I created an event so that I could say show me the ninja only path, which would mean they start on the paths page, they choose to go down the ninja only path, and then they end up on the product page. And then conceivably they go to the next page and they check out right. So that would be the entire thing. So it's path. selection down the path, product page, checkout, and then purchase. So initially, I think the first two were missing. I set those up. Now I see them, but like, I want to say that like the individual path pages are higher than the path selection page. And I'm like, that's there's no way that's true. is the only way to get to those is through that page. Some like, it should be that they are half or roughly, right? They should they should sum to the total of half or or near the path could be higher because people don't want to work. But I looked at that, whatever, and I was like, that's way too high. That the numbers between the two paths were pretty close, which makes sense. But they all they seem too high. then they didn't seem to really relate to the way the path selection page they should. good. I don't know what's going on. So I going to dig into that and then run it by my buddy over there at Mercer's Place. And then this other one is, there's something wrong, like, it does video percentages. And I think it does like 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, not 100, or does play 10, whatever. And I think the only ones that are registering are play in 90. I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Pretty sure there should be some other ones before 90. And then why is only 90 working? So I got to send that into them and be like, is this something about the trigger is wrong? I'm assuming like the con, I'm working. But it's, it works on the beginning and the end. I don't know, so I swear I did it right, but I'm going to send that into versus people to be like, any idea whether this is happening?
00:52:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would love to, like, if you just, like, screen share one day and just kind of show me what you've set up so I can visualize it, because so often we're talking about things, and I think I follow it pretty well, but, you know, the visual, it's a whole new kind of understanding. Okay, so how's sales going for another 71?
00:52:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Steady, Eddie.
00:52:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good.
00:52:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We didn't get a big pop on. We didn't notice that we didn't get a big pop on the new release type. Like, you do to a major score release of the calls. We just had one of those when it was, like, moderate, not great.
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
whatever we know so that was that's 2025 don't want 2025 I was trying to figure out what the different types are because I remember looking at them with you and they're like the 21 or whatever there's going to be in 2025 and how they were broken down let's see okay I don't like to get my notes real quick and see if there's anything else I want to ask about although that the whole mom stuff was a really good oh any updates on just the weddings stuff at all that whole wolf or thing.
00:54:05 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, pretty sure Heather, you know, Heather's smart or whatever. But I think she's basing her price on the total amount of money she's made there. And then she's putting a multiple on that and like, Oh, sweet, no sweetie. That is not how that works. And then she's also basically get on the fact that like, Oh, she did say this. Oh, yeah, the gen tucks revenue wasn't good in 2024 because of a bad contract.
00:54:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's going to remedy itself. And then it will be, you know, like, hmm, that's not how that works either.
00:54:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Her number is not based on reality. But she's like, totally checked out at this point, like, we were supposed to have a meeting, same page meeting today. She's like, I think we should cancel it. I was like, okay. And I mean, just making good money. And she's got two babies now, right? Yeah, and she's like, I just don't want. I don't put any money or any energy towards it. But then she did that in Slack. I don't pay attention to Slack that much. And then she's texting me. She's like, Jamie's really pushing for a meeting. And I was like, are you talking about? It's like in Slack, I go, oh, I didn't see that. So then I went, then there's Jamie trying to keep this meeting that we're supposed to have today at night. And she's like, well, Jamie's like, I think we really need to get on the same page where Heather's future is unsure, right? The very Jamie thing, right? And then I was like, okay, well, there's really three, she's like, oh, Heather's future is uncertain. I go, well, if you wanna relieve that uncertainty, then you need to exercise your first writer refusal. If you're not gonna buy it, exercise it. And the 60 days goes away. And then he can proceed. even whatever way she's going to tomorrow. And of course, Jamie doesn't want to do that, right? Because she wants to be in control. And so she's like, well, if the meeting is contingent upon me making that decision, I say we post upon the meeting. like, the meeting is not contingent upon you doing that. But I'm like, here's the deal. There are three outcomes here. Other cells. Are there, oh god, what did I say? Heather cells. No, you buy Heather proud. One, Heather cells, two, Heather stays in some sort of non-engaged, you know, whatever capacity. But I'm like, this is just, they all equal the same thing. Uncertainty. I go, well, we can lower the uncertainty by you making your decision or not. If you're not going to buy it, just say no. And then we can move to step two. And then, but here's the problem. Step two and step three, no idea how long Those are going to take, right? It could take forever. Yes, no one's going to buy this thing. It's like, what are we doing? Like, I understand. I just want to get the sales page up, charge them $600 bucks and bucks. Because I mean, I thought it's the same principle, right? I about buying it. I was like, nah, I'd rather go buy Lansdowne. Because that's, I'd rather work with Sean. And I don't have to work with it to your point early, right? I don't have to work with anyone. I own the thing 100%. And they can't take the off Spotify. Like, I'd rather go do that than this. And now, of course, now I'm stuck with this software that we developed up to like, thanks, Heather. But I don't think, I mean, I don't need them for that. I think, I I don't think Jamie's going to like, F with me. Right. then she, so then subsequent to that, she texted Heather and like, can you tell me where you're came up with evaluation and can you send me like the countersigned documents of this and that? And Heather's like, I'm not doing that. He's like, you don't have to. We had the rotor back. I came up with it. It's an SDE evaluation based on all the remote, which is wrong. And then she's like, I'm not, I'm not doing your due diligence for you. Like, if you don't have those documents, then I'm not going to get them for you. Um, which is fine. Totally acceptable. You should have them. And then that's where it's at. So then I was like, when's the 60 days up?
00:58:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:58:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
November 4th. So basically nothing's going to happen until November 4th. And then they'll shut down for the year. stops working in December. So it's like, what are we doing? Uh, so yeah.
00:58:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, I don't understand what's happening. always operated so clearly and smoothly before.
00:58:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Just kidding. Well, that's the thing. I mean, part of me is like, like, what are you doing, Heather? you didn't, you didn't need to do this, you know what I mean? It's like, now, now it's like, you're kind of up. It's like, you're getting a motion.
00:59:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that's, that's exactly what it is right there, though. Yeah. done with you, Amy, it's a big off of you and cut off your nose to spite your face because I hate my face and the face is Jamie.
00:59:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. And I mean, it's in the context of like Joe making money now. And I'm like, yeah, for baby, it's the combo.
00:59:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But if Joe wasn't making money, this wouldn't be happening.
00:59:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I know. But my argument to that would be the money that Joe's making is not real money. It's not, it's not a, it's a business that could disappear tomorrow. It's, he's building the wrong business, right? So he's like, he's doing And this AI consulting with who I would say is a scammer. So I'm like, that's great. Now with, he was an ascending kid. He was like, I can see a space, but whatever. Yeah, so they're doing this AI consulting thing where they're overcharging people to do it, right?
01:00:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
mean, come on. separate?
01:00:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, he lives here. Mike came in, Mike came eggs.
01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, that dude.
01:00:33 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I never liked that guy. I never really came to be alone.
01:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you ever do anything with Mike the same?
01:00:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh.
01:00:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought.
01:00:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
hung out with him once or twice, so that's about it.
01:00:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:00:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right, Joe worked with all of them, which is fine. So anyway, it's like, you know, he's ignoring his own business for that. And I'm like, I don't dude. I don't know if that's it. It's a great idea, but whatever. I mean, my plan is still to, I now think Joe, I mean, I'll get with Heather and be like, all right, let's build Joe's business. And on basis, and then sell his courses, and he should build a podcast or network in circle and sell the courses in circle and do that. And then sell them on to your basis, podcast, and dang. And yeah, let's go do that. And then just charge Jamie 600 bucks a month. Part of it was, I was also thinking like, I should just go to them and be like, I'll buy 25% from each of you.
01:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Dude, for real.
01:01:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right? then I'm like, I own 50%. And then you guys can both check out. Yep. Except it's not worth it to the grant, yes.
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yep. But. So you throw something at them that's, you know, gets them by.
01:02:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
problem is Jamie is going to check out too. They're both going to check out.
01:02:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like, whatever. But that's okay because, well, never mind, she owns the YouTube. I mean, because the content really is the only thing we're buying.
01:02:21 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, I mean, I realized also this week that, like, they built, it's the wrong model, right? It's like you're, it's not going to be this huge course. So I mean, same thing, the them on circle. Like if they start, if they got rid of the Facebook group and they put every lead into a circle community and then you were selling the course through there, you're selling the course through email, you're selling the course through circle, but then in circle, they're helping each other, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you, you bolt on like, of course, this is not going happen. But it's like you start what models in that industry work better Zola Zola is doing 120 million a year It's like okay. Well, what how do you go build a baby version of them of what Zola? Which is like they give free websites, dude. It's ridiculous I think they make most of their money by offering free websites and then on the website. They go put a link to your your Put link to your target registry on this button and then when they do that they append their affiliate URL to the link That's wild. I have it is I just realized how late it was and I went on as I've been waiting. So I gotta go.
01:03:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
that's a good name That's wild. Anyway, to be continued 20 mil That's yeah The whole the whole new craziness anyway, okay, you And your special sweet wife go take care of her. Good luck with that Thanks. This ending you guys did positive vibes.
01:04:03 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

> 00:00:02 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Hello, 18 a good morning.
00:00:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good morning.
00:00:05 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you? I'm doing good. How are you?
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good, I'm glad to speak with you today. Um, have you had any kind of background about about what this conversation would be about or what to expect or anything?
00:00:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No.
00:00:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mark is so good for that. Um, Well, um, so I've been working with Mark for the last three years as actually a client of mine and I started working with him kind of partially on business systems teams whatnot. Um, I would call myself a business consultant. He calls me a coach names, whatever. My goal is basically just to help people optimize their business, but for them. It's not really all about the numbers. It's kind of more about the overall just quality of life, um, quality of operations, quality of team. I take a holistic approach to everything. Um, and basically the end result is that people end up being happier. So that's not how I started. I started out just trying to get the most out of the least because I'm that girl. I'm like, I don't want to work all day, but I want all the things. So yeah, I would, I've been a single mom for a very long time. And I also like playing and coaching soccer and doing all kinds of things. So I was like, how do I optimize this stuff? Got really good at it, helped people with it. But the end result was that as I was doing business, I ended up finding some things just made me really kind of angry, honestly, working with bad clients, working with bad people on teams, just being overwhelmed. then I'd go be kind of sharp with my girls and then I'd watch my four very strong will daughters ricochet that attitude across the house back and forth and so I learned that there were some things I needed to cut out and so some systems and processes were born out of Yeah, so that's where we started I've been working with Mark for three years, sweet lot has grown a lot since then in terms of how many retainers we get per month versus so when we started it was about 33 per month and now we're averaging about 90. But the team hasn't actually grown that much so we didn't have the Arizona office then and obviously your new since then and I think that we have lost one attorney since then so there really hasn't been a lot of team growth. growth in order to support that, which is speaking to the optimization of what is done, if that makes sense.
00:03:08 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Right.
00:03:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so last year, I met with Samantha and Lorenz, and we had one conversation, and we talked a little bit just about leadership, because it was more an exploratory call, like, happens if we talk to the attorneys, not the business owner that hired me. And Samantha wasn't interested. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. This process isn't for everybody, but Lorenz kind of around with it. And so we had a conversation that he was particularly interested in, and I'm telling you this because the approach is different for everyone. So what you're interested in and what might be beneficial to you may have nothing to do with anybody else, and I'm not interested in doing anything that's not helpful to you or not interesting to you. So keep that in mind. But what he was interested in is the fact, first of all, Samantha puts up big numbers and she beats everybody. She beats everybody in terms of attorney fees and how many cases she does. I don't know if you know that, but she does.
00:04:13 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I figured, I figured.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, but her approach is different and her approach doesn't work for everybody. You know, there are different types of personalities inside of Sweet Law. There's been shifting around, you know, different case managers on different teams, different assistants on different teams, things like that. And a lot of that, Mark has driven based on conversations with different attorneys and just finding who works best with there.
00:04:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So that's one little type of tweet, right?
00:04:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. But for Lorenz, he saw those numbers and he's like, I could do better. I want to do better, but I don't know how to do better. And so, after having a conversation with him, I figured out something that I thought would work for him and I give him a book called multiple. pliers. And that is how to make better leaders out of everybody around you. So instead of him, because he didn't feel like he was really bringing the best out of the people on his team, and also he didn't feel that that was his strength. So I gave him that book and he had a couple of aha moments, but fast forward three months later, and he almost was doubling his monthly numbers. So, you know, that that's that's some good results. And he was interested in this. So I don't know what might be good for you. I know you're fairly new. New to Sweet Law. Now, I don't know how new you are as an attorney.
00:05:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
know you're a younger one attorney. don't know if you practiced anywhere else before. No, I'm coming up on just putting my second year and know that.
00:05:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Why did you become an attorney?
00:05:55 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
My uncle was an attorney and when I was a kid, my guy was just following his footsteps. I saw it was like a lucrative opportunity. I feel like the type of work is things that I'm able to tolerate more than most people would. So I do feel like it's something that because I know the average time for an attorney is like five years before they kind of make a decision on what they want to do. They want to go somewhere else, you know, but I'm cool like the work that I do coming in here talking to clients, getting like, you know, complained at why is the number this or, you know, just juggling things. I just feel like I have a good tolerance for that and I can just crank work out. Now, there's like two sides to being a lawyer, like some are in court all the time, some are, you know, doing what we do here where we're just office dealing with clients, which I feel like is better for for me, which is why I pick this area, but if I have friends that are attorneys, they're like, I can't do what you do. Like, it's just boring. But for me, I'm like, I don't want go on court once in my career. You know, so I don't know. I like what I do. And I just feel like I have what it takes to make a good living off of it. And it's cool. Like, we have this one case, the kid was like 22 years old, pretty big injuries. And the money that we got for him, he was able to pay off school that he's going to. things like that are cool to know that, like, you know, that took a chance in hiring us and we were able to change a portion of his life, which is pretty cool. On every case is like that, some clients always complain about the money that they get. But every now and then you. get something cool where you feel good about about what you do. So, that's good.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's good insight that that helps me actually to learn a lot about you. So you would you consider yourself pretty easy going?
00:08:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, my my requirements are like very low as long as I have a few hours to go to the gym during the day. That's all I really care about. Well, coming to work early, you would have to do pretty high patients level. did go to a military college, so things that would probably stress people out more or like start to freak out a little bit earlier. I typically have like a longer range of where I'm able to tolerate it before it gets to that point, which why I'm like just so chill at work because I've been through so much.
00:09:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nothing.
00:09:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, this is nothing, you know, um, yeah, I'm a pretty talent person. Like, I don't, or how many needs, you know, but do you feel like do you feel driven or do you feel like I'm just like meandering kind of through life and it's just chill and is really big goals? just don't like I'm the type of person I'll just rather do the work than just, you know, talk talk about, you know, what my big plans are or like, I keep a lot of things to myself and like, yeah, you like blink in like two years later, it's like, whoa, how did Pat get there? It's like, you know, putting in the work like after high school, I went straight to college. After college, I went straight to law school like never really did you live in like, kind of a poverty or like gang area or anything when you were younger? No. And then I parents weren't like really well off, but We weren't like on food stamps or anything like that.
00:10:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, not necessarily that you were poor, but that was it around you.
00:10:12 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, not really.
00:10:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. you just have a. You remind me of a lot of people that had like lived in tough neighborhoods coming up, you know, and so I was just wondering, I was curious about that. So I know that you hope you kind of keep things close to the chest, but would you share any of your professional goals with me?
00:10:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I'm two years in. Obviously, like the first day I got here, I saw that like Sam was the highest. So there's like a competitive nature, but so a lot of respect. Because when Mark hired me, I didn't really have any experience in this. field, first that I had when I first started now, obviously like I got more cases and have a team now, but like I always joke around with their teller like, because I don't have as many cases as she does, so obviously I can't really get the numbers there, but you know, obviously my goal is to be the one that does leading the firm as far as the numbers go, just from a competitive standpoint, obviously every month like things change, but I love that. Because I know I'm still pretty young, but, you know, some months I'd be Lauren's or I don't know if you've met Tyler before. And I have like half the cases that they do. So like, to me, that's like my way of showing that, you know, because I'm obviously they're older, they have more experience and education, but that's my way of trying to get respect that like, hey, I just got here and I'm, you know, starting to make my mark. So that's really important for me.
00:12:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. So do you keep track of stats like how long it takes your cases, what percentage of the time you're hitting a max settlement and what's the other one? Just how many cases you're taking? Like, I know that you're given cases. But what are you doing in terms of monitoring those numbers? and trying to push them, if anything.
00:13:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, I mean, I have a list of cases that get settled every month, so I see a daily track of what the number is for that month for settlements and how much the attorneys fees we brought in. There's also like a little note on there if it's settled for the policy limits.
00:13:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not sure if you know what that is. Yep, that's what I meant to say when I said how much, yeah.
00:13:29 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, so obviously every case we pushed for that, but it doesn't always work out that way. Right. know Mark keeps a better track of how many policy limits cases we get. I don't know if so many cases were because I can keep a lot of things in my mind, like right now because I don't know as many, but I'm really on top of the numbers. Because that's obviously the indicator that, you know, Boss looks at to see where everybody's at you are you able to see that and let if I The list do you have access to you have access to let if I everybody does right?
00:14:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, okay, so we've been working on the dashboard for the last three years This has been a whole long process and and one of the things is just really trying to put together the numbers and a really clear way That are important that help us figure out. Okay. How are we performing? Across the board. How are we performing across attorneys and pods? How are we performing across? Types of cases how are we performing across? Vendors who bring us the leads because we have several different vendors that bring us leads They all perform differently how are we performing across states? So like we're really analyzing breaking everything down and You know how it is any anywhere you go you've got some people that come in to collect paychecks And we've got
00:15:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
uh people that come in because they got missions to accomplish and goals to accomplish and then we got people that are just in there trying to slam everybody like there's a whole spectrum right of how they show up and um so um you said that there was something that like sometimes that at night you'll think about like what you could do better what are some of the things that i've popped up in your head um just being more efficient on certain tasks because when i started it was just me with my case load and then in january i got a case manager and then like march i got an assistant um so i'm just doing every piece of the case myself um now obviously i have people who are being paid to help me um so it's more like let me focus on certain things that are gonna that i need To do, for example, negotiating or, you know, pushing certain cases out, monitoring, that's one of the things I did the last month is going through the case load early and figuring out why something is stuck, or how can I move it forward? Because the more cases you get, some things start to slip and get stuck. Mark does a good job of going through our cases, too, reminding us like, hey, you know, this one can be moved and get done this month. So just kind of trusting another person to do their job, see like things that kind of slip. Because when I first cut a team, I was like, well, this is great. Just let them know what they're supposed to do right. I'm like, okay, you guys go do that. I'll go do this. And then I started looking through the cases and like certain things are being missed. So I know that I can just give these people 100%.
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I love that you've noticed that. And so you have Cynthia, right?
00:17:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
And she used to be on the rental team. Yeah.
00:17:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like, one of the things that he learned about her is that she is very systems and processes oriented, like she needs to have structure. Whereas he said a lot of other people that he's worked with, they don't, they're just like, you know, they roll with whatever. But she likes to have the documented, she likes to be like step by step. Do you feel like you've noticed that also or noticed anything about how she works?
00:17:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, she is like that. But now she's a little bit because for like a good three months, it was just her and I. So, and I didn't know I was going to get other help. So I kind of trained her to, you know, be proactive and not necessarily have to wait for me to task her for every little thing and be like, look, when we get this case, these are the three things that always need to get done. You know, after a month or two, distance to get done. So now she's a little bit more, she's still like very task oriented, but she's still now, she's little bit more proactive where she knows certain things have to get done, no matter what, so.
00:18:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would you consider yourself a leader?
00:18:19 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I'm still figuring that out because I'm a really independent person. And like if I was able to, I would just handle all my cases by myself.
00:18:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, what you do with is being a leader. What's that? What you do with Cynthia is being a leader.
00:18:36 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it's still hard for me because like, like I work out a lot and I never have a gym partner.
00:18:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I always go by myself.
00:18:44 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah. But she's been, yeah, I mean, I know what I have to do in order to get the team to, like I can be a leader, still figuring it out because like I said, a lot of things in life I would rather just do by myself, but. Obviously, can't 200 cases, when I need to, in college, we had a lot of leadership stuff. We're at like lead teams and trained people. I'm just trying to find how to do it, because obviously here it's like, if you don't perform, then your job is on the line. So I need to manage how I lead them, because eventually it's on me, right, if the team makes a mistake. So I need to kind of control and not be too harsh on them to the point where they're like, you know what, just go work somewhere else. So it's like a balance between, okay, we need to like fix this, but not talk to the team in a way to where it kind of ruins the dynamic because, you know, conversation, and they'll always remember that. Um, so that's kind of how many jobs have you had in your life?
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Real jobs or any job. Like I had a newspaper route when I was 11, I worked in the fields and dug two lip bowls out of the ground and my fingers were bleeding by the time I was like 10 o'clock and I was 11 years old.
00:20:23 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
So I was weird, but I worked, I cut grass, I babysat, I did like all of those jobs.
00:20:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And they all shape us. So tell me about your work history.

I used to work at a grocery store before law school. And this is my second job.
00:20:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So how are you? How much time did you spend there?
00:20:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Three months?
00:20:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Three months? Yeah. So what did you do?
00:20:51 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like did you play sports? Yeah, I played water polo and swam in high school.
00:20:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It was a different. Swimmers are different I'm trying to I'm trying to profile you.
00:21:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, the biggest thing is like the gym like that's like my my baby so That taught me a lot of lessons.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um Do you compete?
00:21:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't but People would think I would the way I treat it, you know Are you an only child? No, I have an older brother How much older two years?
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you're the baby Okay, yeah, just taking so do you feel like you've had much for opposition and life?
00:21:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Um Probably not But those are a lot of times those were because of the things that I did like Like I worked my up in school to Fast the bar on the first try for example I could have been an opposition if I failed and I got away another year to take it and things like that So I feel like I do the right things to minimize the amount of like hurdles because I don't like when things get postponed or I Don't know I'm just very that's why you don't like working with other people because most people don't show up like that, right? Um, I mean the team's been really good so far.
00:22:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't really know. Let's just talk about the team I just talk about you in general like all the way up through life because you do a lot of stuff by your own So it's definitely not just about your team and and treat law Why does it do you feel like like all you do you feel like you're I don't think you're an extrovert? But are you extroverted introverted or ambivert meaning a blend of both?
00:22:50 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
But it just depends what I'm doing like I Work I'm pretty pretty introverted and just come in do my thing and go home but then at the gym I'm looking
00:23:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
totally different person like. Yeah.
00:23:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You know, or if like, there's something that I want to fix in my life, then I'm extra vertical because I'm like, I got to get this done or do you have to be around people all the time like to feel and there's okay, so you're an amber bird. I can literally work in a square box and not see a single person for a year and be okay. But I can also come here and like chitchat and have lunch with people like, you know, yeah, it's kind of weird. Like I can really do both.
00:23:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that's that's good. You actually you have a lot of qualities I am very familiar with and they're all amazing. So I don't know that you know that about yourself yet, but you have the potential to do some really amazing things. And the great thing is you should try to stay humble, which I think you actively work on constantly. I think you're probably conscious of that. But there's a huge difference between confidence and arrogance. But the power of confidence is that you get some things done faster, but also it has energy and it's palpable and it moves people around you. And I think that you have it, but you may be resisting it in the vein of wanting to not be arrogant. Hold on, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm we'll keep our eyes up. I will finish my call and then no, not here and there. You know what, go ahead. She can come. Come on, you're filthy. All right, thank you. you okay now? Okay, so we had a massive flood in our yard. We had an above ground pool that just exploded in the morning and it sounded like worse than any tornado or anything I've ever heard. And so my daughter was out there and she she's 17 and she's going to clean it up and apparently it cleared a little hole in the corner of the fence where her dog could get out and she was terrified that she'd lose her baby and so she was like freaked out and I'm like okay anyway you never know what you're going to get no I've got four daughters and they're all super strong well they're two of them are grown 117, 114 and I have a granddaughter and It's the most wonderful, amazing thing in the world, and it is also the hardest I can imagine in the world. My mom used to always say, I hope you go and just like you. And I was like, well, I got four, so... Perhaps you four is something else. Yeah, and by myself, that's been something else. But like I said, it birthed. It birthed this, and I love what I do because I get to meet amazing people, and they're all leaders, and they're all brilliant, and yeah, yeah, pretty magical. I love what I do. So anyway, back to you, Pat. You prefer Pat. Yeah, not Patrick. I think they're way worse. In the way. Well, okay, so let me look at this time. just kind of think about this. So I don't know. this is... We didn't have a contract. Mark and I did make a contract for how long we'd work. with you, but he's paid for the quarter. So what I would love to do is just, so in the beginning with anyone, and then normally they're seeking me out, not this is somebody else's person that I work with. I do work with teams, but it's not the predominant thing that I do in way that I go about it. But since the quarter is paid for, the schedule that I suggested to Mark was I meet with you, once by yourself, you and Lorenz twice, although we may switch that up and just be do more one-on-one stuff because you will have very different goals. The benefit of meeting together is that it helps uncover some of the commonalities, some of the issues that might be not necessary issues, but what are the processes, what are the levers inside the business that we can do to improve? So like intake, for example, does not have a script that people follow consistently. And because of that, calls are handled differently. And we have figured out some better ways to handle calls, but because there's no script and the process, it kind of depends on whatever mood people are in, kind of mood the calls are in, and that's not the optimal way to run business. So, Mark's competitive too. Mark wants to see Sweet Lock Row, wants to get more cases, everybody wants to make more money, but not burning people out while doing it because life, you get one life, like business is not the thing. Life is the thing. So, figuring out how we can do all the things better and more powerfully in a more leveraged way so that, like I said, I love more from less. So, What I think, I would love to be able to spend time talking to you about just things like Cynthia, we talked about her a little bit. don't know anything about Elsie because she's newer also. And kind of figuring out how you guys work like what are some of the things that you come across. It's really a lot of just, it seems like we're just talking. It's very, it may even seem unstructured. promise you, it's not unstructured. I have been doing this actually for 22 years. So I've learned that there are certain types of conversations and it's primarily PAP. It's primarily probing. So I will ask a lot of questions and sometimes what you'll find out is that the questions made you think something you weren't thinking before. They make you ask your own questions or ask a question you haven't. Ask yourself before and by coming up with that answer, you're just like, Oh, well, I didn't think about that before. So now maybe I could try this. Maybe I could try that. The other benefit because we're doing this kind of as a group inside a sweet law is that as I'm talking to you and looking at things like go to Mark and be like, Hey, you know, Pat was having this experience. I didn't know about this. Can we try this? Can we try that? know, and I see that, but Mark, and I imagine you've figured this out, but Mark loves people. He loves his people. I don't know how he shows up in the office, but the way that he talks about people is, you know, this is like this is kind of his surrogate family. He, he cares like he's not, he cares about to take, like you talked about how you talk to people. He cares about that too. Although I think he's better at it now since talking. Can you me? I'm just going to take a little credit there. Just, you know, just work is work. We're all people trying to be the best people that we can be. And we do better when we can work with people who have some different experience, like you talking to Samantha. That's great that she's supportive and that she answers questions like that. And I think I remember Mark talking about you doing that from the very beginning, just asking lots of questions. Like that's actually also a great sign of a leader there. It might not seem like it because they're going to somebody else, but it is. So goals, that's what we were talking about. Okay, you want to compete with Samantha. Yeah, I like get some of the best case, not necessarily with her specifically, but as far as Sweet Lodge, just be one of the best attorneys. there, put up those big numbers, but also you care about the clients that come in, you want to take care of them. You've got these broad chill shoulders that can take some stress that other people can't take. You've noticed that you've got to be accountable for the work that happens on your team and so that you can't just leave them unchecked to work fully autonomously, but you did try to give them autonomy and but with direction and leadership. All of that is really, really impressive actually. There have to have to be diplomatic and when I say sometimes, so hold on a second. I won't say who and where but in some places, some people just don't care that even in tweet law, there's there's somebody that just those up for paycheck. That affects everybody, because they don't hold the same weight. And that could be in any department. I'm not naming names or anything. But my point is that even just one person like that impacts the energy of the firm, impacts the trajectory of the firm, and it takes a really long time to hire anybody. In the three years I've been working with Mark, I think we've hired maybe three attorneys, and he constantly has ads out looking to hire people. It's just really difficult to find good people in a good match. Not everybody wants to do pre-lit, right? know that. There's a lot of different things that people are looking for. when he's got somebody, he wants to take a care of them, train them, and make the most out of it for sweet love, but also for that person. And me, especially, I'm just mom wherever I go, which is not a professional way to really look at it, but it just is what it is. I was, I was born a mom, I was as a kid taking care of everybody and like, can I feed you? can I do for you? Um, so, so that's it. And I feel like you've got some mad potential actually, and it's really exciting because I've been watching sweet love grow. You know, I've, I've heard, um, some that Cynthia's had some struggles and to know that there might be, but also that she's great, that she's nice, you know, that she's a good person. So if there's somebody that can help her grow and, and be better and be able to be even more valuable, then that's amazing. And that makes you even a greater asset. So I would love to talk to you about just leaders. ship and optimization. different ways that like you've noticed, there are some things that have to be done. Like, so one of the things that I know sometimes calls just don't get followed up with consistently enough and the ball gets dropped there. And you know, if the cases age out too long, sometimes we've missed things. We're not we're not getting those. For the life of me, I can't tell you how many times I forget that word. And I know it. Yeah, no, when we don't when we don't get the backs. It's the benefits, but it's that's not the word. Yes, thank you. I swear there are some words in my brain that just are never want to come. Oh my gosh, and the most random ones and inappropriate ones. Sometimes we'll come and have the right ones. Anyway, policy lemons. Okay. Well, let me turn it back. Yeah, so not following up with things consistently and also like, again, on the intake side, not asking some of the right questions and then we find out that they've already talked to another firm or that they haven't gotten to a doctor and the case is too old, know, like there's all these different things that impact the likelihood of being able to do well and get our money because at the end of day, it's also a business like we're here to help people, but we got to help the team first by making sure we can stay in business and do good. So all of that. But I think that you and I talking together. Now, it's not a, wow, amazing. I can't believe this thing happened. You know, we don't have conversations like that. What happens is it's like working out like if you lift and you follow a regimen for years, sometimes some of them like you can, you can beef up fast. but some of them are like you just look six months later and you're like dang like I'm a little more cut and or I can I'm not tired anymore or these joints don't hurt anymore or like this this you're so young you probably don't know these things but yeah I'm injury free thing going you don't you don't know I'm 40 so I'm about to be 48 so like I know about these things I'm sorry um weightlifting is life for me I don't go a lot but it literally but I go consistently all the time and it's it's life like I'll never quit I'll be a hundred in a gym I don't care I'm like I'm not gonna have all that old dick crub and stuff happening anyway so um but I think that if we focused just on because I think that you're already you may not do you feel like you were interested in leadership like consciously
00:38:01 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I feel like naturally I'm just like better off as like the grunt like just have me do work and I'll crank it out. So not naturally like seeking out leadership roles, but I feel like here everybody has their own little team and it's cool that way because I get to manage it and it's not like I know a lot of firms. It's like case managers just bounce around like whoever needs to grab want to do this, but for me or here it's like your team is your team like they don't just go work for somebody else for a week and come back. So it's cool because I can obviously I need the help right so I'm going to do what I need to do to make sure that everyone here is like working good and they're happy and so it's cool in that regard to know like when we have like a really big mantra. whatever that, you know, the team did it. at the end of the day, if I'm managing them well, then those numbers mean that, you know, as a leader, you did the right thing. Which is cool because if I go out and go do something by myself, that's great. But if I was able to do it while managing four different people, obviously that takes a lot more work. So the reward is like, wow, he did this and was able to manage all these people. And it's like more responsibility. But it's cooler when, because I know like if I'm just by myself, I know what I can do, but I've never had to really manage people. So that's like the new test for me. Which is cool like when it works out. But you like it? Yeah. Now, if I have like five people then, I don't know. But before we got into the group and we're doing good. So I'm gonna have the smallest team because I don't know. The biggest case load, but like months where we beat the other teams is like cool, you know, because it's like the three of us or when it was just me and Cynthia's like the two of us were able to beat the team of five, you know, yeah, but things like that keep me competitive. Like, you know, the mitigation guy, but he only has like Nick, really love. Yeah, really a lot of cases and he was beating me for the attorney's fees this month, like Mark sent it like a couple days ago and like that pissed me off. I was like, what's Obviously, if you get like a big case, big numbers, but And that's the ones that go to litigation anyway, so Yeah, they're kind of predestined to be higher numbers anyway. Yeah, but still.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'll just tell you one thing, though, is Don't compete with people playing a game you don't want to play. You don't want to play a little game. You don't want to play litigation, so like, don't compete with people playing a game. You don't want to play. don't want to do that. It just, it gets in your head. You know what I mean? Gun from the people playing the same game as you. Because you just get tripped up. You take your eye off the ball and that becomes a problem. It creates this internal dissatisfaction that can't be corrected because you're not playing the same game. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:41:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
00:41:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I get that, but you're not playing the same game at all. You know that, right?
00:41:43 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, well, if Mark sees it that way, then I'm cool with it. But as far as I know, could ask him, you can ask him.
00:41:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know he's the numbers and it was last and that's all he was saying. litigation and everybody else is 100% completely different. And I know because I've been talking to him for three years. And we look at the numbers and we don't even talk about Nick and the litigation team. It pretty much is isolated and honestly That's my bad. We probably should talk about it more, but that's it's not because what what really? Mark see sweet lot as a pre-vit firm period and the story litigation is only there to serve a necessary You know thing. It's a need we have to have an outlet for it. There's money on the table We're gonna take it, but Nick is playing a different game that Mark's not even really interested in playing It's just part of it. You know, you know I'm saying. So I You know you could talk to him ask him out right because Mark I think is pretty open about stuff too And if he tries to evade the answer cuz he does do that sometimes pin him down and be like wait look I like for real tell me Um, you said we're not planning to say gay That way like put it on me. I don't care. I'll be scapegoated all day long. I'm built for it. So Yeah, so the question really was like, do you see yourself as a leader and what I see is that you're still evolving and defining how you see yourself. You really just getting started in the professional world. And, but I would tell you, Pat, 100% you've got innate natural leadership qualities. And you may not be seeking them out. That's, that doesn't mean that that's not what you are. A lot of leaders don't. There's different types and, and it has a lot to do with the extroverted introverted type of thing, right. But some of the best leaders in the world were there because everybody else said, look, we need that guy because first of all his ego is not going to trip us all up and get us in trouble. It's not going to send us to war like Mr. somebody with their orange hair, but you know diplomacy whatsoever. You know what I'm saying, like, so. So, there's different types of leadership, here's where it's just natural for you. see a problem, and you say, like, you see yourself as, I just the grunt, and I just want to knock it out, but that's leadership stuff. I see that there's work that has to be done. I'm going to do it. That's a leader. You know, even if you're only one person, you're a leader of one, I know you've seen enough people in life to know that there are people who won't even steward themselves and manage themselves, right?
00:44:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, percent.
00:44:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. and there's a lot of those, right? Yeah. So, you not only will take care of yourself, but you see that, okay, I've got this thing that I'm a steward over now, this little pod, this little group, and I was trying to give everybody space to let them do their own thing, because I like to do my own thing, but then I realized they're not doing it well, so I'm going to help them. I'm not going to browbeat them, and I'm not going to hurt their feelings. I'm just going to show them how they can be better so that we can be better. Dude, that's leaders all day long. That's like good leadership all day long. So I would like you to just kind of ponder on that. It doesn't mean you need to go seek out leadership opportunities. It doesn't mean that you need to see yourself any kind of different. But knowing that first of all, it helps the people that you do have stewardship over it. Like I said, there's an energy to it where, and I would bet you anything Cynthia already feels this and else you do. It's Elsie, not Elise, right? Yeah, Elsie. They just are like, Pat is doing his job. Pat is watching out for us. Pat is going to help. Because you have that calm energy, but it's also strong and it's also smart. And people, especially women. in work and probably in lots of places are going to feel safe there, but when you're also giving them the skills and empowering them, you're going to find out I'm telling you this because it'll be important. There's going to be a lot of ways that you can compete and you can win because you'll be able to activate people that other people won't be activated because they'll want to work for you. They'll want to do their best for you because they don't feel afraid and they know that they're supported.
00:46:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Does that make sense?
00:46:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. And I could tell you I might be wrong, but I'm almost never wrong about this stuff and I only say almost just to be humble, but I'm never wrong about this stuff. So watch, but people will want to work with you throughout your life. know you don't know where you're going to be, how long you're going to be there, I really want you to hear this and take this with you because you'll see it showing up in your life that you can get a lot out of people because they feel safe with you and because they know you'll do the work. That's another thing like a lot of people are told what to do by people who have no food because they're not doing it. They've had terrible leaders, terrible bosses. When they get somebody who's in the trenches with them doing the work, who knows what they have to do and appreciate it, they'll show up at a whole new level. So talking about leadership, there are two books. you like reading and all or listening to audiobooks?
00:47:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I don't want to have you do things. I'm never really trying to read at least when I can.
00:47:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you like podcasts?
00:47:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's more tolerable, yeah. I think I've read maybe one full book in my life. Like as a kid, would be reading and I would just like read the same line over and over my mind would just be somewhere else.
00:48:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you didn't lost.
00:48:14 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I would like to go reading.
00:48:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you ADD?
00:48:17 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
No, I just don't sitting there flipping through pages.
00:48:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But you don't listen to them either though. So it, um, do you, like, do you watch a lot of movies? Or you just like hit the gym a lot like, uh, I watch movies.
00:48:35 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, it was the same movie like over at all. I for sure don't have ADD. I just don't like, I just don't like to read.
00:48:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, now this is me asking because like I said, I'm trying to profile and understand because if I try to get you to do stuff that you don't like and don't want to do, then that's just not going to be good. So what I can do is just kind of distill some of those things that I think would be useful for you. Some people like to and they get a lot out of it. So my approach with you would be, let me go refresh my memory on some of the books and talk to you about a couple of things. But the principles of, so there were two books I would have recommended. One is called multipliers and one is called essentialism. And the thing about multipliers is just kind of basically something I think that you do innately and that is look for people's strengths and abilities and just help them tap into it, support what they have to do, and then give them the freedom to do it and what you described was doing that with Cynthia. So it would basically be the purpose of reading it would be to see maybe the other applications and also so that you had a greater awareness of the power of what you're doing, but it's not, it's not necessary to read it. And then essentialism is just, there's a lot that gets done, and this would be towards the processes and figuring out, you know, where is there anything that's happening that's being done that doesn't really need to be done, are things being prioritized so that the most important thing is getting done day-to-day to push a case to where it needs to go, right? Every day, there's lots of phone calls that have to be made, right? There's lots of contacts, there's lots of information that has to be gathered, whatnot. So making sure that the most important things get done first, that drive the needle forward, sometimes that's not what people do, sometimes they just take the low-hanging fruit, like this is the call that's in front of me right now, this is the case that's in front of me right now. instead of maybe triaging according to their value, their likelihood of getting close, how good at communicating the client is and you know there's all kinds of different ways to kind of evaluate what's the thing that should be done first at the beginning of the day and throughout the day and so on. So but if we have some conversations about that at minimum for the next three months because that's what's being taken care of and if we talk about you know what your goals are what I'll do is go and solidify to and make sure that I've got some numbers for you to take a look at and compare it to what you're looking at already and see if I've got any more information than you see how I can help you be like okay this is your trajectory this is what you're doing um across the board in terms of so there's attorney fees which is our really the staple number that we're looking at. But there's also how many cases, there's also how many cases get closed, like the pace that they're getting closed. And obviously, you guys can't control when it's resolved and you get paid out, but we can't how long it takes to get closed. So just looking at those numbers and giving you kind of one-on-one insight into that and a little bit of a different perspective, then let's say Mark would have, I think that it could be something that would be valuable for you.
00:52:40 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Are you interested in that at all? Yeah, because I mean, the numbers and stuff is like just puts it right there and you can see everything. So I like the numbers because it's just easier and I understand like what's lagging or what's doing good. Yeah. And it's like a motivator, like when I see the numbers, like, I like the numbers.
00:53:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I have to, the only reason I'm not going to do it right now is because I have to ask Mark, you know, I'm able to share and look at, um, just got a new, uh, report also, which is the best one that we've had so far. So let me look at it. When did you start again?
00:53:30 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
November 1st, 2022.
00:53:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Holy cow, it's been not long already. Geez.
00:53:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. Well, the first year was just like a blur.
00:53:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so we'll, I don't want to do last year. do equals this year. That was free by team. Yeah. For the year, I still don't know what I'm allowed to say. So I absolutely. Okay, that cannot be right. That one has to be wrong. That's the other thing. As our report is, it's in progress. And so we got to validate it, make sure that it's pulling the correct data. Because like it's saying, Nick's team for the year is averaging 1.8,000. And we know that that's not right. For an average of chummy fee. So I will, it's definitely wrong. But you're up there for sure. are in the game. And for being so new, I think that's something. Let me look at cases closed. For the year. That's interesting. Yeah, I just want to make sure these thumbs right. So I'm going to see what I'm allowed. to share and I'll check with Mark because I think that what drives you I think seeing these numbers would be huge for you and I think watching the numbers change would be huge for you and then some of the other things I'd like to do is talk about L.C. and talk about Cynthia you know how they're doing any patterns you might be noticing good or bad like I definitely want to know about good and in terms of the bad like we're not here looking for how to fire people how to get rid of anybody anything like that we're 100 percent here for how do we make everybody better and feel safer enjoy what they're doing more sort of the clients better and just just improve everything so I think it's really important to because sometimes people come in whatever and their agenda is how do we weed things out that's not what we're here for at all. Yeah, so that's what I'd like to do is just have some conversations. And the other thing though, Patrick, is like I was saying is that what happens is I'll ask questions and they kind of reveal other questions and lead to the next questions. So what I would be interested to know is if you, I would love for you to just take a little time and think about the conversation we've had today and see if any thoughts just kind of pop up that maybe hadn't before or they had that maybe you hadn't done anything with them. And if you're willing to, like, I would imagine you're not really a journaler.
00:56:41 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Well, you want me to like think of a set of questions?
00:56:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, just kind of like, if you have a thought that you notice that was a result of this conversation, um, read it down and it doesn't have to be super in debt. That can be a bullet point, but it has to be written enough so that when we talk again, you'll remember and be like, wait, what was that about? Because I'm terrible. I'll write something down and be like, I can't even remember what I was thinking when I wrote down. So I just needed to be thorough enough that you could come back and go, yeah, I was thinking about this. Or like, if you're working and you're watching things going, you know what, I noticed this and I hadn't really noticed this before, because that's kind of all part of the evolution. But what that will also help me to do is know how your brain works, how what you're what you're kind of patterned are, because again, this is to be customized around you, like imagine, I don't know if you're like a Marvel dude at all. Which one? Marvel? Nope.
00:57:45 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
There's like a million characters.
00:57:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Well, if I say Marvel, most people might say, are you a Marvel person? They're like, yeah, yeah, but like, just anyway, imagine you're Tony Stark, and we're building an Ironman suit, but it's just for you. Like his suit was built. for his strengths and for his weaknesses and for his mission, like what he was trying to accomplish. He kept trying. He kept iterating his suits, right? He had new versions because he's like, well, this one didn't do this. So I needed to do that. So my process is basically trying to build your perfect Iron Man suit. Like you're already great. Tony Stark was already brilliant and amazing, right? He was pretty powerful just as it was. But with the suit, you know, that was like multiplied many times over. So the goal here is to be like, what's amazing about Pat? How do we amplify that? And so it comes through probing, learning experiences. So everything that you think about and everything that you just kind of notice and observe, bring that back to the drawing board with me and go, okay, I can work with that. Let's do this. Let's try this. type of thing. How's that sound?
00:58:57 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Good. I'm really open. I won't shy away from any questions. You have so pretty, like if you're asking something, I'll just tell you what it is.
00:59:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, my goal is to help you hit your goals. Yeah, it does, it does, it does. But the energy with it, like I want you to come with your competitive side. want you to come thinking, all right, we are gonna figure out how I smoke these balls. I'm like, we're gonna figure out how I beat this list is like we get, we get all the cases and we get the best attorney fees and everything else. Like, that's the goal. But while also being a good guy that doesn't hurt people, that's not like plowing through people just to get to where he's gonna go, that you're doing that, that your team's winning, that they're getting higher bonuses, know what I mean? That incentive program is good, you know, and there's a way to help everybody. Like you could be the guy that helps everybody get paid more. And I think that'd be awesome. So. So I want you to think about that like, okay, I've got kind of this silent partner over here is going to help me win even more, but it's not just you winning. It's your whole team winning and it's all a sweet while winning. So, you know, think about it like that. then read anything down that you have. And we'll figure out, we got to figure out a time next week. You already told me what can work for you. I'll see. I have not heard back from Miranda. So let me check with Mark. See if we can get something on the books for next week for two of us. And then, you know, it's really fluid in the beginning. It's kind of awkward in the beginning, but it gets some legs on it and we'll get we'll get a flow. All right.
01:00:47 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Okay. So next week is not scheduled yet.
01:00:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, because I, it's supposed to be you, me and Lorenz. I haven't heard from him yet. So. Will yeah, I'll follow up with you on that.
01:01:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
That's okay. Yeah, I mean, any time works for me like Monday mornings. It's just like Class of a waiting all weekend to call and select a little bit push, but Afternoons are probably best Okay, we can do that.
01:01:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you told me like any day after like at three or later one or or three any day at three I think you said Yeah, I prefer not to be that late I like to be done with calls by like two o'clock, but Monday's different because I started 10 and then I've got back-to-back calls until 130 so like two or three on a Monday would be perfect three o'clock on a Monday is perfect Because I keep a lot of the other days up and just for the actual work and not the beatings But I do need to get with Lorenz, but for you and I we can make it Mondays at three When so the one one once a month that it's just you and me so far we can do that so like a month from now same time we can get that on the calendar and then if you have any questions if you have any thoughts and be like you just want to shoot it out before you're thinking about it I would love it in real time rather than waiting until we talk again because then my brain gets to start working on it because I keep a small roster and I'm thinking about everybody all the time it's just the way that I work like this is my little team and I'm thinking about like wonder how Pat's doing like checking his numbers like how's things going and so if any thoughts come up I would just love it if you just shoot an email and be like hey I was thinking this okay I can do any questions um no I'm actually excited for this people about my thoughts and stuff so this is
01:03:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
different, you know, but I'm open to it, you know, Mark mentioned to me that obviously there's a value there, so I'm always open to trying because I trust him and um what he thinks is worth it.
01:03:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's good to know. I'm really glad you shared that with me because like you're little stoic over there and just trying to read you and not give enough a lot with that poker face.
01:03:25 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
This isn't me though, like so maybe I'll, I don't know if I'll open up, we'll see. It's kind of natural, it just happens. Yeah, it does. But good thing is I listen to everything you say, so don't think like this guy's bored out of his mind, it's just like, I'd rather just like when it's time to listen, I'll listen when it's time to talk, I'll talk to the thing. So don't be put off by it, a lot of people are like, well it's better than showing the emotions, like I listen to everything he's saying, you know, so.
01:03:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will, I will learn that too in, in the way that you should. and the conversation. thank you. That was really helpful to me. So now I'm really, I was already looking forward to it. I think you're going to do amazing, but I want to serve you well. Like I, you know, that's what makes me happy. So I'm looking forward to it. I've got somebody knocking at my door. I know my daughter needs me. So I'm going to go and I will follow up with the pool. I know. Thank you, Pat.
01:04:24 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I hope you have an amazing day. You

You muted, homie.
00:00:15 - mark sweet
Okay. here we go. I did the okay to this being recorded.
00:00:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You what?
00:00:21 - mark sweet
I had the okay to being. Oh, which makes sense because you're not going to agree to it. Yeah, you shouldn't be talking.
00:00:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
One hundred percent, but did you not have to do that before?
00:00:31 - mark sweet
No. Or not that I noticed anyone.
00:00:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should have been having to have to do that before every time. Okay. Well, because I don't have the same experience as, you know, people that attend. so I like to know, because at one point. It was, and then maybe it still does is it, but I removed this feature. So it's not supposed to do this. It was emailing. people. I had a time making sure that they were approving of the upcoming call being recorded, but the biggest problem about that was it would take any event I had on my calendar and do that if I invite someone to do it. So like, you know, my schedule with the girls and their dad when they're gone, I shared that with my fiancé. And so he was like, why am I getting asked if this can be recorded? Like, what?
00:01:31 - mark sweet
Anyway, it looks like this quantify is working.
00:01:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That? Okay, so can we get the details, like, defining what's working?
00:01:44 - mark sweet
Yeah, so part of the issue is issue and take student signup on it.
00:01:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so putting it as, sorry, doing take is doing the signup with quantify.
00:01:53 - mark sweet
Signup, okay. Because my side is used to putting it as valiant.
00:02:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:02:02 - mark sweet
Creating a little bit of an issue in that regard. So we're just going back and fixing it, but they've signed at least. At least three cases. And maybe less than a week. Yeah, on 10 grand. So the price works.
00:02:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How, how good are the cases?
00:02:22 - mark sweet
Yeah. mean, they're regular cases or nothing. That's like. Right. There's one more trying to get where it's a broken head, but it's just kind of a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.
00:02:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There were any of them just like terrible and maybe we shouldn't have signed them like any.
00:02:41 - mark sweet
One was where we initially kind of referred it out, but they ended up signing it. It through two different sources, but they got information that we maybe didn't get or wasn't told to me about a preexisting injury.
00:02:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Interesting. Well, but I'm seeing at least at least three, if not for the very least, we have a game to watch for a little while. You know what I mean, even if it's only three three at 10 grand still worse. Yeah, but yes. Yes. The way that I look at things is that there's there's always potentially anomalies. It's not, you know, the thing until it's being done consistently. Oh, right. So, but yeah, for sure it looks like something we've we've there's worth looking at continually until until it's not. That's just the optimistic.
00:03:54 - mark sweet
Right. It's a lot better than the other one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. . Yeah, no, we get it. But you know, the 2022 should be a very small percentage of your cases. It was like 40 something percent.
00:04:10 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't understand why. I mean, I guess I do, right? They, they all have that on their lead form. Like, is it actually within within the last two years? Like, how many of your clients are actually converting cases like that that are any good?
00:04:27 - mark sweet
None. It technically is a lead, right?
00:04:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's technically exactly right. But it's like, yeah, no. mean, that's why they do it. Because they're we have to do it.
00:04:44 - mark sweet
Right. Because it's just a way for them to pad. And then I see like, it's just, it's the nature of the beast. Not happy about it, but yeah.
00:04:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, Let's see. One second.
00:05:04 - mark sweet
I'm seeing at least three. So that's good.
00:05:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There was numbers. Give me the end of the month. I know it was 85 and since. 83. bad.
00:05:25 - mark sweet
It's kind of a couple of the weekend. So it's like if it was longer, they would have hit 85, but it was already a long week.
00:05:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's a 65.28. So weird. I am searching and I should get the right thing, but I cannot get the right thing. You sent it over the weekend, so I didn't just pop it straight into notes. What day? Let's see. Six more. All right, I'll do it that later. Well, I wanted to look at it though, and then I wanted to see what we want to look at in the report. That's now that I, we have the reports so far that we've asked me to get in the habit of figuring out what do we need to look at each week. Some of those things don't need to be looked at weekly. So that we're taking, so like the price, so we were looking at conversion rate was the last thing that we requested in the report. For leads versus. Retainer signed the month reports. It's under reports or is it under dashboards? That's under dashboards. Management main, right? Okay, so it's not. Oh, it was a different report that we that already existed that we asked that one to be updated, I think. Do you remember Mark?
00:07:19 - mark sweet
I know you're talking about I'm trying remember what we asked to be updated though.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm just going if I can find the next report. Gather report percentage of cases. Yeah, I did that. Do you remember down because we were all talking about it together and then. Send the requests over through you.
00:07:54 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you. Yes. Would you send it to Stacy.
00:08:01 - mark sweet
I mean, either way, you were saying we had a widget that said, like, sign up great and then with each source.
00:08:16 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Sign up, great meaning that converting from leads to retainers.
00:08:21 - mark sweet
Correct.
00:08:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What's, how so is a widget like the blocks. Okay. Okay.
00:08:41 - mark sweet
For like, instead of matters by zip code, which. Yeah.
00:08:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What did you want to call conversion rate, we can call it.
00:09:01 - mark sweet
I mean, that dude is definitely vulnerable.
00:09:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, we need to find.
00:09:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Why would someone be marked as converted yet not have a matter?
00:09:50 - mark sweet
Potentially in a death case or if it's for some other name. Oh, but if you give an example, I can definitely probably. thing into a little deeper.
00:10:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So it's Jill Elizabeth Prophet, P-R-O-F-F-I-T. Yeah, so it's absurdly, and I'm putting the report together.
00:10:13 - mark sweet
like, I don't know what this means. Elizabeth Prophet is absurdly, okay. Because she is a matter.
00:10:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
There's no matter. When I search for her by her name or her email, and I pull back the records, I have contacts and takes parties.
00:10:32 - mark sweet
But isn't- It's matter right now.
00:10:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Shouldn't be listed on this sort of synopsis result?
00:10:42 - mark sweet
It is.
00:10:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I have zero matters.
00:10:48 - mark sweet
I don't know what to tell you.
00:10:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, did you search by her name? Did you search by her name?
00:10:59 - mark sweet
I searched- I kept in Joe Elizabeth and there's only like one person in that name.
00:11:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's weird.
00:11:08 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I just search by just the name and now there is a matter. When I searched by email there was no matter. Okay. Whatever. I'm not going to get into the nuances.
00:11:32 - mark sweet
I don't know why but yeah it's there.
00:11:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I was like well I know converted I thought meant it's done which clearly it doesn't mean but whatever.
00:11:48 - mark sweet
That's that's the role it's just. Sorry, Roberta just means it's no matter.
00:11:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it. So what's the status of the beta-litify functions?
00:12:01 - mark sweet
We're working through it right now. It's Isaac's working on it. Like we had a meeting with it where you signed up for the beta program. So it's in the works, but I think it's like mid June. So I'm like that. It's not ready, but yet. We also Westlaw has their own. So we're playing around with that where it automatically summarizes medical records that you upload. And creates timelines. So we're seeing you that saves a lot of time or is a good use, but it's only 750 bucks per month for six seats, which it's not bad compared to litify who wanted $5 a file. It was doesn't work and they're just suggesting more like that doesn't even make sense.
00:12:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I just every day I marvel at the greeniness of everything and just.
00:13:00 - mark sweet
want like 1250 for 200 250 files. It's like, it's cheaper for me to outsource it to India. Like, I don't know what to tell you.
00:13:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. To AI and India.
00:13:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's insane. So just absolutely bonkers. Yeah. It's going to be so interesting to see what happens because it's like almost impossible to predict the best investors and market analyzers couldn't predict the things that happened during COVID because it was such a unique time. like, we are still and will be for a while and such a unique time because of the pace of technology. But there are so many companies that are gouging left and right that it's just interesting how long those models will be able to maintained, but also what the potential repercussions are because that's the type of thing that inspires innovation and other people to come and solve problems, but we're in a time period where more people can innovate because they have access to tools and functions that are affordable. Anyway, it's just the it's fascinating. Anyway, all the more reason to be as leveraged as possible in as many places as possible and to be which is the same thing really just a different way is optimized as possible. I don't think you can be as leveraged as possible without being as optimized as possible. anyway, um, yeah, just all the things making sure what we have never have it and what would be really great for the flow of our meetings is to figure out because because we've had to go through a process of figuring out where we could get this data but figuring out what and I did say it before but it's just we got to keep doing it and my brain isn't going to go by itself it's definitely going to be a group effort. What data do we need to look at every single week and then there will so there will always be the portion of the reporting right looking at that and then the the portion of the meeting which is okay now that we see this kind of trending what could we do to improve any of it really like sometimes it's a you know intake obviously we need a script we need to figure out this that or the other thing talking about how and we need to get to this mark how do we improve the incentive program to make sure that we're hitting max retainer max oh you know the work word. Policy limits. Policy limits. And, you know, that we're not going two months without making contact with somebody in an active case, that type of thing. But with the speaking of being leveraged and optimized, these meetings can begin to be, I think that they've always been helpful and productive. But I think that with good reports, they can be, we can use them even more powerfully if we come up with a set of things that we want to look at every week. We always look at the incident by source, by state, which is really good. We're going to start looking at retainer roughly. mean, we didn't break it down fully, but $259,000 for for 29 or 27 walker versus you said about 200,000 for a 25 monkey. That's something and at the very least that needs to be a monthly thing. But what I would love to do is if we could maybe just spend a little time thinking about what are the things that we need to look at every week, what are the things maybe every couple weeks or every month or every quarter that, especially based off of the conversations we've had, that if we look at it with that kind of frequency, we'll be asking ourselves the best questions and therefore taking the best actions for optimizing things. Anybody up for that today or you want to work on that next week?
00:17:48 - mark sweet
Whatever you want to do with it, I'm going to do it in a way, the scripts, Marco, hold from his old firm, Jose is funny from his old firm, so we're getting some more other scripts. try to cobble something together that makes sense for all of us. We're still a little ways away from that, but we definitely get in that.
00:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a target of I want it completed by huh?
00:18:16 - mark sweet
Well June 14. I said June 15, but that's Saturday.
00:18:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. Okay, good. Um, well off the top of your head. So, um, we see what the heck just happened. I hate when I hit the hotkey that brings up the the source for the webpage. Um, I do it all the time. Okay, so we report. know, obviously it's retainers, stores, I stay. Or has been pulling that data. You should be able to get it and let it. So actually let's just go to let it. So where would I go. To get that the way you've been getting into x by source by state. I have three. I'll go this month.
00:19:27 - mark sweet
You're trying to get what the data that I give you. Yeah. I just had the cases sign this month. In this case I just changed the data last month.
00:19:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that should be something that if you can you look at. What if I or I can change. Okay. Okay. Okay. we want to make sure that everything that we need is in this report.
00:20:00 - mark sweet
Okay, um, any report we could just add it to it on the bottom. It just makes it easy for me to look at it. It's called cases sign this month.
00:20:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so let me go back to. Okay, um, I do want to see it. So, well, whatever, it looks a little bit different in the widget. Where did I go? Why am I there? Oh, yeah, excellent this. All right, touch forward. That is what we mean. Dan, I don't know if you're looking at the screen but so any quick thoughts about what we should be looking at every week. Obviously it takes resource by state. For you, Dan, any thoughts to optimize what we're working on?
00:21:23 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The other thing that I, in this scenario, would want to, I don't know how we can see if, like, on track, off track, right? So I actually really do this. But so, right, in my business, the meeting that we had like seven through this morning, it's like we look at how many 30, right? So we know, hey, do we average 30 a day last week? Looking backwards probably isn't the best thing here because week too much time. So it's like what should be the average leads per day here? And then what should it be like per vendor, right? So rather than, and this could be a thing, well, there's Josh, but it's like, rather than go, it's sort of like, I don't know if you remember this, but like, we created that early warning system in for us, where we could put it on a site and go, hey, this, we know that this site gets three leave today. When it falls below this threshold, I want you to tell me that because there's potentially something wrong. So here it'd be like, hey, monkey averages 10 leave today, which is pretty much accurate. So it would be, hey, any time that that number is below 10, a you want to be able to pull up a dashboard at any time and look at it and go on track, off track, especially for like an ongoing vendor, like monkey or walker. And That comparative thing where you mark could know on any you know went next Wednesday It's like H FYI. There's looks like monkeys dropped off and Then you can stay on top of it rather than always going backwards always having to go after the fact to go Hey, leave slow down this past month Something like that. I just don't know if it's possible You know what we could totally do that in Lee Pully Yeah Yeah We could actually do that we could probably do that in Lee Floyd Does we Eric and I then they now there's now like this custom code function And we used it to do that we're using it to do the rotator. So we're defining But what gets rotated it 100 to whatever we pick So if we if we counted monkey leads and then reset that every month I bet we could do like well the daily average would be set we would just set that in a field and then we can manipulate that at any time so it only would be checking against something like that that's probably doable great work everyone I ask the questions you get the answers like
00:25:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. That's great. I like that. Anything else that we should be looking at weekly or monthly or quarterly. Off the top of your head.
00:25:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So probably. Like trending average settlement. Right. So how does that look? So that could be that could probably be. In this dashboard, right? you're saying the current. or for the month, right? Whether it's year to date or month to whatever whatever the filter is to date, something like that, maybe, so that you can see. So that's sort of the primary metric, right? If you throw out your ginormous settlements, Mark, I heard you got one. It's a rumor. There's a rumor if you throw those out, right? Yeah, exactly, totally. But even that number gets factored into the average, right? the outliers don't really toss it. The outliers would toss it for the mom.
00:26:38 - mark sweet
don't put that number in let it by because it would just Okay, good.
00:26:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Then we up up the number. All right, perfect. Yeah, so you just want, that's like the another, I'm just trying to think of like, what are these sort of heartbeat issues, right? Or heartbeat metrics. So there's the leads, there's the-
00:27:00 - mark sweet
the revenue then there'd be like versions there's average settlements per month yeah so let's go into that a little bit so how much is almost like a separate dashboard by the way it does the average settlement is one how many matters settle that month yep how many matters close that month because those are not the same things yep how many each team settles because you know hopefully it gets to the point where every case they settle they're going to get new case so they can get a new clause how many drops and how many sub-outs yes and then first-engine policy limit there's no We're tracking that.
00:28:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mm hmm. And you're tracking it in live.
00:28:09 - mark sweet
Right. Yes.
00:28:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. It's Josh, right?
00:28:35 - mark sweet
Oh, Steve had mentioned off the cuff. So to get it for whatever it's worth that they've been working with Einstein AI. Which is built into cells. of letify or whatever else and like what if I wants $5 a file to rename it like that's not going to work. But I'm saying AI may be able to do the same thing.
00:28:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Same thing as what.
00:28:58 - mark sweet
Anything I don't know.
00:29:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I. literally don't. It's a team. It can do anything. We all know this.
00:29:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's how that works.
00:29:08 - mark sweet
It's built into Salesforce. Other than that, I don't know.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so if the data is there, then it should be able to analyze a computer, give us what we want, the way that we want to look at it, depending on how well it's been programmed.
00:29:29 - mark sweet
Yes.
00:29:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I guess it depends on what this can do here.
00:29:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what the interface is, because if it's just as clunky, you know, like, if it's a good interface where you basically have a chatbot and you tell it what you want to know, and it can then just go go through the data, find it, and present it to you in the way that you want it, then that's great. If not, you're probably better off sticking with your dashboards.
00:29:59 - mark sweet
Right. I mean, a big thing, too, is it's private problem with open AI as it's open, and obviously what we're dealing with, we can't really have it open.
00:30:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, it's the open source and Dan can correct me if I'm wrong, is the foundational code that people have access to, but not everything like the API keys and the API integrations, which would be what's this would be using. All of that data is private, I think, Dan.
00:30:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it is. Yeah. You're basically creating your own container.
00:30:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it's the repository of code that everything is built on that is open source. That's the that's what's open is the code for the programming, but not what's connected to it through APIs. Guys, does that make sense, Mark does just the worry of forces words. Yeah, I don't, it should be fine, but the more we can keep it in the closed ecosystem, happier I am. Yeah, and I think the privacy rules and everything are going to be more clear and improved.
00:31:15 - mark sweet
How the legal world are 20 plus years behind on anything and everything.
00:31:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean for yes, but for the companies that want to work with you. The owners will be on them to create those, those things. So, but regardless, we don't. I love AI. love technology. All the things, right, but that's not the only way optimization. We've already laid when we started Lidify was just everything was a nightmare and it's taken two years to get to anything kind of. Just dependable and clear data, but two years in how many people are still using Lidify and have no idea how to use it well and get good data and optimize and whatever. So, you know, we're making. very good use of what we have. We, in the process, we didn't just, you know, suddenly get our data. We figured out how what we need to be measuring, how we can measure it. It's been a whole long process. We do want to leverage things and see what we can do, but for you, especially with it being all the laws that are involved in privacy and whatnot, better to let somebody else play with it, figure it out, break it, know, you jump in, reverse and revision two or three, something like that. And in the meantime, we'd be optimizing at the foundational level right here, like this, the dashboards and just getting into the little fire reports, making sure that we're segmenting the data, all the managing the team, all these things, like we're doing, we're doing good.
00:32:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay, so, it looks like there's a whole, full trust layer built into this for that. So that like sensitive data is not exposed to the outside world.
00:33:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Instein AI.
00:33:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, it looks, it looks, I mean, whether or not this, I mean, I guess it's available since it's salesforce, like, and electrified salesforce. I'll run it by Josh. I mean, it looks interesting. It's got, you build your own prompts in here and. Oh, do I mean, it's definitely saving you the whole idea of coding out to chat GPT, right? It's doing all that for you. And then you have this layer, they call it co-pilot. So the first thing I looked at, I was like, no, but this is a better breakdown. It might be something. Yeah, it's funny. I talked your boy Salco about the AI. And he. He shockingly, he might come as a shock to you, Mark. But he's all over it. The minute I brought it up, and then I explained what it is, and he goes, oh my god, you serious? He's like, it can do that? I go, yes. And he goes, oh, oh, okay. Yeah, that might be interesting and too funny. He's I was wondering what good AI was for. I'm like, well, you might find out.
00:34:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What am I missing?
00:34:29 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
What was the idea? The AI demand writer. So it, in essence, right? It was that I didn't really have any right demands. But he, so I explained it to him because he was like, oh, it could never blah, blah, It would never, he gave it, of course, a very specific example. So he was saying how like, there was a case, I don't know who it was, it was Sam or somebody. And he did a file review for them, and they had like, any of So across those two companies, some weird, you know, medical thing and they missed it and he knew what it was. And so he's like, they missed, they would have missed it. Like, AI would have never caught that. I'm like, AI would have caught that. he's like, what do you mean? I go, if you give it, stop words for lack of better term or alert words, it will lead the whole file and tell you that word's in there. He's like, are you serious? I go, yeah, totally serious. Can you keep updating it? I go, yeah, you would just cause I'm like, you'd give it a first set of words. Like, hey, here are all these words that matter. Make sure that these words are in there. I'm like, and you could get it. And he's like, Oh, well, then the lawyer is going to have to, you know, review the whole file. I don't know. It could, it could spit out. A demand preview for the lawyer that hits all the highlights. they don't have to read the, are you serious? I'm completely serious. But you just, I'm, I'm. You and mark right you guys would have to teach it like it's it's like you're literally teaching it And once it's giving you output that you like it will just continue to do so He was like, oh, okay. That's not how I thought it worked. No, it doesn't just do for you. It does Once you teach it what to do, right? So he was he was like, oh wow, okay, that's a different story. Yeah So now can you use this Einstein thing to do that.
00:36:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's find out All right um Okay, so We've got The information that we want to be looking at each week. So leads conversions Settlements per month. How many manners settled that month? How many matters closed that month? How many each seems settled? Drops and about percentage of policy limits. So I've got a note to Stacy for all these different things that we looked at. So she can talk with you, you guys can work with Josh or she can, whatever. Monthly, let's see, well that already that covers that. Okay, so that's a good start. Isaac is working on that, a little fly, and Tic is working on the script. Ranking leads in clients. So maybe on if we had the Einstein AI, wonder how much better, how much progress we could get on that thing.
00:37:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we have turned out. You could give it parameters and then it goes and looks at everything you're in Salesforce.
00:37:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That'd be crazy.
00:37:58 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right? Because then you wouldn't have to. go back update data. Oh man, I wonder if it could do that too. Or if it could spit out list of like, hey, me all the records that are missing this. Oh, interesting. All the records that are, um, whatever, like if you're just like, hey, show me all the records that are missing the state name, all the all the intakes there. And then, but more importantly, like, show me all the show me all the, I mean, basically you could just add prompt reports and but you could probably and then go further into it. Like, just keep giving it prompts and parrying down data that is sitting there running report after report after report. Or it won't do that at all. Right. We'll find out.
00:39:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be amazing. mean, there's so much data in there. And if it's connected to Salesforce, Salesforce is already we consider it to be safe. they're integrating through API, you can guarantee Salesforce is protecting their data as much as possible to make sure that what they have is not leaking out through those API access keys. That they're going to spend a ton of money because that's their whole business and livelihood. So if they have the integration, I don't know what else you would want to feel as safe as you can operating in this world, knowing that there's risk at all time that data leads happen. know what I mean?
00:39:45 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:39:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Freedom of Information Act. All these, it's just a crazy, crazy, the stupid ways people think that they can circumvent living in a digital age. like, if you don't want to be caught as a bad person, don't be a bad person. Anyway, okay, let's see. So we were looking at Cordogiwock. How many new doctors? Now, where are we at in the course? that was Q2. It said, which just ended, right? No.
00:40:25 - mark sweet
And the gene.
00:40:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And the gene. Okay.
00:40:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And the gene. How many doctor referrals? are the top doctors? Profile them? Goal by end of Q2 is 100 incident per month. Attorneys? Okay, those are some of the goals. So we'll just touch on these real quick because these we have a month left. The goal is for attorneys, 1 million and attorney fees, 3 million and settlement fees, total per month, triple per quarter. wants that to be. Oh, I see this settlement. triple of the attorney fees. I'm not sure. I didn't write that clearly enough. Wants this to be 1.2 in attorney fees and 3.5 settlements, 3.5 million in settlements by Q4. How are we doing on that? how would we look at that in a bit? Is that possible?
00:41:23 - mark sweet
No.
00:41:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So that's something that you have inside, and you can just tell us. Is that something that we should be talking about just monthly since it's a quarterly goal? yeah, I don't think weekly would make a question.
00:41:45 - mark sweet
Right now I'm trying to fix a walker issue to keep on our cell phones. And now I'm finding out some of our numbers on our website aren't important, right? So I need to go at Isaac because this is not a problem.
00:42:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like right now or since we get off the call?
00:42:03 - mark sweet
Um, we got 15 minutes, but I'm potentially missing you.
00:42:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So right now pissed off. Okay.
00:42:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Ooh. All right. Well, I don't know where that little is, so I need to figure it out. You should go do that.
00:42:20 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes.
00:42:23 - mark sweet
I'll organize the notes and real quick though before I forget Dan, I saw your email. No, I don't think we have a U.S. and news top law firms, I don't think we can buy that.
00:42:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But if they've found it- No, I just need something that we can put there.
00:42:39 - mark sweet
Okay. American Student Professional is just, they mean as lower of the year or whatever that is.
00:42:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I need some graphics for this to sign up for it.
00:42:51 - mark sweet
Let me know if this looks good and then I'll get on their money.
00:42:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Just put them in the hat and send them a picture.
00:43:00 - mark sweet
But yeah, look, lower the year sounds better than U.S. News or whatever.
00:43:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Very nice job. Very nice. Okay. You know, Isaac, I'll organize these notes. Dan will go get some interesting data and see what we can do to.
00:43:19 - mark sweet
Is there a number that can give the walker that technically goes through lead flow, but would connect directly to our intake?
00:43:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Like you want a dedicated number for that?
00:43:30 - mark sweet
We can create one. Yeah. Because for whatever reason, I'm calling our 800 number. It's not working.
00:43:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know why.
00:43:37 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So we can create. Yeah, we can create. And it's just for that.
00:43:43 - mark sweet
So it doesn't need to be an 800 number. Yeah, we can create that.
00:43:48 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. Well, I am then that's another point of like, Hey, this. A way of tracking Walker. Yeah.
00:43:55 - mark sweet
It only takes a couple minutes. Okay. Can you email us me? Because then I can give that to Walker. So then. I can stop this and some calls.
00:44:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
00:44:07 - mark sweet
Cool. Otherwise, the other thing, Missouri is ready to go. We've got retainer done. We think it comes set up. So I think when the doctor is sending over his first case today.
00:44:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks. We have a first case today.
00:44:22 - mark sweet
We should.
00:44:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Okay. I mean, I have questions if you're not going or.
00:44:37 - mark sweet
I'm going to wait for Dan to make that phone number while we're doing this, because at least then that solves my problem short term. Okay. Figure out what's going on. Isaac sees not responding to me. So you might be at lunch or something. Yeah. So, okay.
00:44:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's try to figure your questions real quick. Um, just an update on new hires.
00:44:54 - mark sweet
We have Hank, we have Elizabeth. We've got an interview on Wednesday with another intake person potentially.
00:45:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That'll do it. Who's outside. You want, but you want to forward this to six, seven, four, seven, eight, five, four.
00:45:14 - mark sweet
Yep. Okay.
00:45:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, can Liz so far doing okay.
00:45:24 - mark sweet
Yeah, I mean, it's still really, really early.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:45:32 - mark sweet
So we started some working through like other cases. So I don't have a lot of updates. Okay. And he's been a little more time with him, but I wanted him to just start getting used to the systems and he's basically just helping more rounds at this point. Right. And working on some of the files.
00:45:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And then the other question. Yeah. We were talking about improving the incentive program to be able to make sure that we're hitting policy limits. Have you made any progress with that?
00:46:14 - mark sweet
No, because I want to see what they're just first before I throw out a number because of my self basically, which is not good.
00:46:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do you want this number to announce that it's from Walker?
00:46:27 - mark sweet
It's short, we can turn it on too. No, no, because they call and say I'm calling from Walker, so, you know, okay.
00:46:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when will you have figured that out so that we can get at least 60 days of data and preferably 90 days of data, okay.
00:46:50 - mark sweet
Because again, otherwise, I'm like, okay, they're hitting, let's say, just 80%. And I'm like, okay, if you guys say 90%, you get this extra whatever, but the real number was 87%. And I just looked at a very small sample size, then I end up paying out a bunch more.
00:47:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when did you start tracking the data?
00:47:09 - mark sweet
This last month.
00:47:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have a date? Thank you.
00:47:35 - mark sweet
May 14.
00:47:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, it's my birthday.
00:47:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do I know that?
00:47:44 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, it'll just work. I mean, you can call it good work. I'm just setting it up, Mark.
00:47:56 - mark sweet
I don't test yet.
00:47:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, that's a problem. Hey, now. Here I'll call it right now. I mean, it'll be actually would be surprising. Worked that fast. Great. What am I doing? Did you call it? Who's calling?
00:48:11 - mark sweet
What's happening? Two on both music. Sweet lawyer. Thank you. Thanks, Patsy. just want to make sure this works. Okay.
00:48:22 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what is this? That's kind of amazing. That the phone works that fast. Yeah.
00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thanks.
00:48:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Thanks. Mail. What was it? Twilio.
00:48:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. So August 14th will be 90 days. Then you can look at the data that you can have. August to figure out how you want to plan that September. We execute. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Well, that touches Troni once everything that we're working on if I've gone through my notes, right? Although I'm skimming it pretty quickly. But I think we covered most of the things and got some good traction on what we're working on. So I'm satisfied with the call. Anybody else? Anything else we need to talk about? Add to the list.
00:49:30 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Did you get Valley and to open the kimono?
00:49:36 - mark sweet
No, but I can.
00:49:39 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Do it.
00:49:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's what's her name's husband, right?
00:49:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Yes. That's it.
00:50:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Any other questions?
00:50:10 - mark sweet
No.
00:50:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Any song.
00:50:14 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No.
00:50:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Alrighty. Also, if you guys have any like travel plans that are coming up that would interfere with calls. If we can just because sometimes a little ball of style plan ahead.
00:50:29 - mark sweet
Yeah, I'll touch you guys some stuff.
00:50:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, cool. Okay. Sure that we're making traction and progress every week. Sometimes we could probably do a decent job like this last week with emails and whatnot. But if we know ahead of time, maybe we can plan better. Okay. Go yell at somebody. Have a good day, you guys. Wonderful.

Okay, I'm just going to move on Yeah, I can hear you now. I'm just going to move down to my family room to sit on a more comfortable chair. I was in my other room office, but I got a nice chair here to sit on. Oh, yeah, yeah. I decided not to do anything with my hair or change it to a fancy shirt for any videos, even though I just did a little free coaching call to my school community. And I just think. Yeah. Totally relaxing. get my nails done at 4.15, so I can't wait for that.
00:01:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm going to do my this now, but up again. is literally what I slept in, and this is my sleepy hair with a little bit of blushing. Yeah, let me get one, my little laptop thing that you put in your lap.
00:01:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, you buy those at Staples or whatever, of course.
00:01:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've got a couple of them.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, good to do. Get there.
00:01:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, good Lord.
00:01:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you've had really bizarre sleep patterns, huh?
00:01:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, this week has been nuts. I don't know like what's up with my body.
00:01:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's actually like it's a good thing. Like I have more energy because I'm not wiped out all day long.
00:01:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, but yeah, it's a little weird.
00:02:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like your voice message.
00:02:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was fun. You must have just woke up. You sound very sleepy. Oh yeah.
00:02:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was still in bed. Cool.
00:02:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is how that was. mean, hi, browser.
00:02:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hey, how's that YouTube video going or YouTube out going for you?
00:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Getting nothing. But Dan said, well, like you said it's not clickable. And I just left it there. It's gotten views, but not a good ad.
00:02:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it has to be over a minute because I see it end up becoming a short, like when you send it to me. Yeah. I think that's why it's not clickable.
00:02:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. I don't care.
00:02:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I thought you did it.
00:02:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, Yeah. That was the whole point. And it was not like not telling you like, I don't care. It's that. I actually care leaving it up causes me more discomfort and it's a good thing because it's need to do that. So I am in the practice of doing things that stretch me. Yeah. So that is the primary purpose of that. is this going? don't even know what this program is. trying to close. I don't even know what the app is. So I can't like, oh, that's CapCut.
00:03:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, for a quick CapCut.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Goodbye. Thoughts you are going to block me. I don't think so. Okay. Now the app store is blocking me. None of my are dragging me nuts though.
00:03:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Mmm. Yeah. had to take some Claritin the last two days in a row actually.
00:04:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would not be able to breathe without it. I have really bad asthma and L.R.G.'s. Okay. So one thing is, can we move this call half an hour later?
00:04:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. It could be later than half an hour, too, if you want.
00:04:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. when I said it, I'm like, I'm going to be up, but I'm not even getting back from taking my daughter to school until almost 8, Not exercise eaten, and let me go look at my calendar real quick and see. Okay, so on Wednesdays, I've got missionary training. That's why I wanted it early on Wednesdays. Yeah, if we could do it at like 10, 30 or 11, which is two hours later or two and to all. all. at at not Let's see, let's this for next week. I'll put that there with this and all following events. Didn't move, it's not move, hold on. And then Tuesday. That will be amazing. That will be way better. Because I really want to be able to show up. But you were three hours ahead of me and you seem to be an early bird.
00:05:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was like, ah, but I am an early bird. So in your nighttime, I'm like, I shouldn't turn my phone off at six or try not to that on weekends. I'm usually not on or if I am on it's more, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, just creative spurt.
00:06:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I've always been like that and my girls are like that so I can train myself to do whatever Yeah, to an extent. I definitely I'm physically affected by the moon the Sun the bar a barometric pressure Significantly I ache even if I don't know that the weather has changed. I feel it in my house in my bed. It's um, but I Teenagers and they don't want to talk into like midnight They're gonna be gone soon. So I want to be available and I'm like Yeah, so that's happened a few times to this week at them early and Yeah, this is this is the season that I'm in and I Oh, I'm not gonna get emotional, but because it's almost over.
00:06:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm just here for all of Okay, so you
00:07:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I got to find a Google Doc. I want to talk about all the things. There's so many things that are being things that you're working on, things that I'm working on. My most exciting thing that I want to talk to you about is what we can do together, but I do think that it's an exploratory process. So, and I want to put a priority, top, top priority on how do we get Maria incoming money right away?
00:07:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because Maria always does that for everybody else, I want to put that script in. Well, and also in a smart way that like, I, you know, I could, you know, put up a thing in analytics thing to do some stuff. It's just I don't want to be then tied up for the next month, doing done for you work at the cost of my stuff. So, so there's a happy medium. But I do know that I got pretty energized when I saw that YouTube video this morning about those guys that made it two million to nine months. I'm like, what? But yeah, I mean, there's, there's, and I have some, like, like one gal just paid me 500 this morning just to do a VSL script for her, which I know should be more, but I figure if it only takes me two solid hours to do it, I could just leverage that and sell maybe a few more in Ellen's group, because I just mentioned to her all, I was thinking of doing this, and she said, okay, I'll pay you. The licensing of the funnel that I've built, I'm in talks with this one guy that might want to buy it. So, but I've never done it before licensed on actual funnels, so I don't know what the details, so we'll see if that goes anywhere. But that basically, I would transfer the funnel, my ad copy, the actual ebook I created into his thing. But, There's some nuances to it though because it wasn't a profitable funnel. It's a break even funnel Which is still amazing for look take a funnel that was meant to sell People to kreena's and mine like you know now it's for just one cape product program and book a call to her 4800 things So that's the only thing and part of me was like if I have money just sitting in the bank account I could just run out to it in a new account and find a really good ecom Academy ecom course to Be an affiliate for and use the funnel cuz it was 20% conversion rate like for this $3 thing So I'm like man But that's the issue just missing a back end So I don't know if this guy would want it without a back end and I'm not going to that's kreena's intellectual property like how to Build a drop ship store and I don't want to go create a course without I don't want to sell it to him Without him knowing all of the details like I never want that because he could be someone to be the future that would buy other funnels that I'm make or something he knows.
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right? So I mean, as long as you're up front about what he gets and what he doesn't get, then let him design.
00:10:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, that's what I've done. I've sent him everything. All the Facebook ads cost the screenshots of all the funnel stats, everything. So from the get go, this is really built for someone who already has a mid ticket or high ticket 1000 or more ecom kind of course and then it's perfect for them. But it's interesting. was I'm learning this because then he's like, let's say a ClickFunnels platform. said, well, no, I wouldn't get my ClickFunnels account. Like, so all these things, I guess some people who are into buying and selling funnels, it's a really interesting, you know, I guess they're used to you just giving them everything. So I think, like, if I were to do it again, I would put it into System IO and be like a separate account, right? Because like, that's it. And then here, here's just this my account and the email I set up for this funnel like that.
00:10:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, yeah, you could duplicate eight. So, and this is what I was talking to Seth about doing, too, is because he's got that breakthrough challenge. And in Ontoport, you can just shove it into somebody else's Ontoport account. You can do that in high level. It's called Snapshot. And if you did that in System.io, but what if you duplicated that in these other things, and you said, oh, if you got System.io, it's already built for you. Here you go. Here's the cost of, so it's not even really a licensing fee. It's a, you know, how we had those, like, templates for VSLs and things like that. You could get infusion socks, campaigns, where they had it. It was, it was basically a part of infusion soft. wasn't a show they do it now. It's not even called that anymore. Now it's like a keep or something, right? Anyway, but you could either do it yourself. It probably wouldn't take too long as long as you were familiar. with it. But if it's basically so you've got landing pages, sales page, checkout pages, unless they're all in one, order bumps, fulfillment. Well, thank you pages, right? And then whatever the sequences are, all of the platforms are relatively similar. As long as you can navigate to it, you just create it and create the automations. It will probably only take you a few hours. And now you've got it in multiple platforms, and you can tell it to people on the platform that they're on. As long as the platform allows you to share it, like high level does, on-trip port does, and you'd have to have an on-trip port account, which is way too expensive for that, but high level.
00:12:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And system IO would be just copying the funnel or if I just create a separate account. Yeah. I'm still here. level for that too, to an extent. so yeah, so, so it is, we'll just see where that goes. And because yeah, I just had that brainstorm yesterday morning, I'm like, wait a minute. There's one on that basically, I created some tip to tail and it's like, what the ? Like, I should be compensated for this, you know? So, but it did make me think of all my other stuff, too. Like, I have micro for magic. I've got high ticket toolkit.
00:13:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you have, like, a document, a library of what what offers you have and what you sold them for?
00:13:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, up to date current one, but yes.
00:13:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:13:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, I would probably just need an hour to make it up to date with stuff.
00:13:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Well, what if, what if you did that and we brainstorm together and figure out maybe there's a different type of stock that you could offer or you offer this and then upsell down to all the type of thing. just to generate some cash for you without bogging you down timeways and done for you type stuff.
00:14:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because if I crack the core on how to sell, like you mean like sell the funnel to other people, like to like.
00:14:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, so like, yeah, the micro offer magic, like itself, if it's a course, like what I wanna see, what is your library of things that you have that you've sold that you could sell again, maybe with a couple of tweaks, maybe you need to update a checkout page, maybe you need to connect to people. I don't know, like what is everything that you have that is still relative, where you could put together an offer and say, you know, here's all the things, pick one, choose one, or pay this price and get everything, that type of thing.
00:14:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, like to the consumer to buy. Yeah, than like sell the actual pay, this is a converting funnel, I want this. Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
00:15:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because, so you said you need $3,000 a month, is your, like, light's on cost?
00:15:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, yeah, $3,000 a month, doesn't it? was really $5,000 a month?
00:15:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. if we could figure out, um, just, so I like to do hybrid things so that we reduce the burden, um, it's the done with you done for you stuff that has higher ticket and you can sell easier, but it comes with a bigger burden. So you want to kind of offset that with another type of offer, if you can, which doesn't increase the burden so much, but also gives you a little bit more income and then potentially has, you can sell other things affiliate offers, your own offers, whatever. But, um, so in order for us to sell, like, a 6k package, we don't have to do anything other than. Write an offer get some eyeballs on it. I'm thinking and You I mean if we sell two of those you're good We're right and and if if we can sell to you we can sell two more we can sell two more like Not all the ones right, but build up the queue for it. feel like that is the simplest way to Put some money into your need account and then siphon off the tiny for whatever We might be building and meanwhile give us a little time.
00:16:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Give you some breathing space So that we can build something that's scalable and build some con together So wait, so let's just repeat that last part like if I brain just zoned out for a second but to me like If you and I create a 6k offer Sales page for or even a Google Doc with what's including right here's we get here's the problem is here's what you get That might be a faster path to cash in the next two weeks.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's exactly what I'm saying.
00:17:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So yeah, that's what I thought. And I agree. That's sort of why I've held off. was going to send out 30 looms a day to all my people saying, hey, I've got this 100 days to 1k days. You know, thinking of, you know, launching this and book a call for me if you're interested. then I was going to sell whoever gets on the call, but I know it's not a. I wanted to wait until we kind of strategize because yeah, because I'd rather have something we build together.
00:17:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
if I'm going to do looms, I'd rather do looms than to that.
00:17:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:17:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the most lovers thing because there's no overhead cost to that. So we can just split it 50 50. I can pay for ads if you're strapped right now and we just figure all of that later. So. And or I just paid for it and like you're doing some of the looms like that's the thing we can figure out how to split like I don't. there's a lot of things I don't like to do that you love to do. So if we figure out a good balance where you're happy with what you're doing, I'm happy with what we're doing. You know what I mean? Like, I'm sure that we can find those things really well. And of course, I'm a grown woman, I can do things I don't want to do and will do things I don't want to do. And likewise, but I think that's the fastest easiest thing to not bog us down to also establish a little bit of a brand awareness with us operating together. A kind of a mutual audience, which is going to have a different vibe than just Maria or Justina. And then when you have the money and you're reading, you're not like, how do I hustle up some money? Now we can talk about structure more frequently and really build out what's our long term thing, build our maybe individual courses, not individual, like a combined course, serve in the way that we're talking about, you know, we could and calls and co-working all of that stuff that we were discussing, but I think it's not, we can't even have that conversation until we've got money coming in for you if you don't have to worry about it.
00:19:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm supposed to get started for us working together, right? So now it's time to pull the trigger.
00:19:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it'd be so great to fulfill that for somebody. You can't get a quality, that. I don't even know anywhere where you could go get somebody who's going to give you the business structure that I would give them and the marketing that you would give them. For that price and for the level of service that we would give them, the handholding that just we've got you and not talking down to you.
00:19:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
There's so much condescension in this world.
00:19:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. You know, like, and I was talking to my love last night and he is so glad that I'm working. with no years and doctors and things like that. he's like, you just, he goes, I'm glad you're done with the internet marketing world.
00:20:05 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I said, I'm not, I'm never going to be, but here's why.
00:20:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
People need me. Like, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't have this experience if it wasn't for my path through here. Well, there are so many of us who, people just, they go here because the marketers are marketing. All they know is I need to make money and I need to do it from home because I've got kids or I'm taking care of my parents. Like I can't leave, but I need to change my life and the opportunities available to me aren't working. So they go online about business, the people that are the loudest are internet marketers. So that's who they're going to hear. said, I have to be there to teach them there is real business to be learned and taught and available to them in where they're at. They're in the internet marketing world. I'm going to be here being a voice of reason and logic and real systems. Real service, real values, real KPIs, you know, and not just how can I get money out of people as fast as I can and launch the next thing before they catch on to what I'm doing.
00:21:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:21:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:21:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Oh, this is reaction.
00:21:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He said, yeah, you're right. I know you have a call. just say it like that, but. Yeah, but it's been a long time trying to get him. Because he just hates that. He just knows how many of these people that and some of them look like. Christian choir boys and they're in the back rooms like bankrupting people and getting them to sell their houses and mortgage them to buy this mastermind coaching thing. And then these people aren't qualified. They just got sold and they lose their houses and they lose their, you know, they get divorced. They just, it destroys them. people suicide, like it's. Yeah, really.
00:22:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
horrible thing and they're out here like I'm the greatest thing in the world and people are literally worshiping them and It's really disgusting So yeah, that's why I have my pros and cons because there's a bit of a bro culture, you know Alex from Ozzie and who he attracts, right?
00:22:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I don't want anything to do with it I almost even don't study it because I look at it and then as soon as I hear like The things that he has said he's like, yeah I was willing first of all he lied and he admitted to lying and he was like whatever it takes to make the money and He said different things I'm like you told me enough to know that you have no integrity that Selling is the bottom line and that you can't be trusted Why would I listen to you that that makes no sense? want nothing to do with pretty much everybody in this world Or they're all about and hub and yeah, just go park it over here And I'm just like I there is a group of people that you know, and it's not the super religion disorienting, but it's the conservative. Like, I want to make money. I do love marketing. It's exciting. But I don't want to be slimy about it. And I don't want to be condescending. And I don't want to sell a grandma out of her home or a dad out of his retirement or, you know, all that kind of thing. And there's particular language that's used in a particular vibe, energy. And I'm in that world, but I'm not of that world.
00:23:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you know what mean? Yeah, exactly. No, I'm the same. Yeah. What do you want to do?
00:23:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want to open up a Google Doc and start mapping out? Yes. So you now is the thing that you were looking at today, the YouTube stuff relative to what what we were doing. Does it have any bearing in terms of like creating an offer or structure?
00:23:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
we'll open up the Google Doc. think you started one, right? It might as far as The initial part of the YouTube video was kind of interesting how they just decided to throw up a 5K offer that really wasn't really created yet, but they were always one week ahead, right, and but they made sure they treated the customer like gold so they got what they want. So, it probably was your typical thing of they, I mean, it was all in German, right, so I don't know what the inside of the school program is, but it was probably definitely all about having a good offer building an audience, you know, having accountability. That was one thing that was intriguing. They offered a weekly accountability person or no daily, I think, so we could have Sally check in on them every day if we wanted to, you know. But yeah, yes, so I mean I can take a look at this off.
00:24:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I've got Stephanie Stephanie's $30 an hour and that's mostly because it's partially benevolent and she needed and I believe in a button so I don't do that but she could help with that too.
00:25:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, yeah, and, and, or even down the road have a I be that person right that yeah, I'm trying to get my documents alone.
00:25:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:25:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sure. Yeah.
00:25:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mama, I'm a bear marketing that one. Okay. Let me share. Okay. That's weird. You just said participants can now see your application, which I've never. It's never said that before.
00:25:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just. Yeah. Oh, yes.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This doesn't really have. Um, the offer, I put it, it was in, I think I just set it in box or my bad. Hold on. I don't want this.
00:26:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You gonna buy another backup?
00:26:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. I think I might just pin a room like I really don't even want to do any video period, but I'm like, do you think this is upstairs?
00:26:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Two of our bedrooms are that dark blue color actually that you have.
00:26:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I, I like these just, um, when I, when I look at, like the contrast and the energy of the light in, in some videos, I also like there was, they have this like bright yellow and I just think the energy of the bright yellow is really nice. Um, and I, I think about energy and I think about the color psychology, uh, a lot yellow is calming and trust, blue is trust also. anyway, um, see, here's your Google doc. I'm not open to that. And then also, I think it was just a voice message that I left you about what we could do or maybe we just talked about it.
00:27:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know. I love it in the voice.
00:27:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did I put it in a Google Doc? About the offer? Let me look at the amount of shared stuff that you shared with me. Okay. I think it was in a voice message to be honest.
00:27:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:27:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, I just put a path for making $50k a month. There it is. It's a different doc. Oh, Tina Partnership. Yeah. I've been almost manic this week, but yeah, so I went there like SL, $6,000, a written custom business, ops slash system slash team plan, and a custom marketing plan. We'll create it together on a two hour call with them. We do not fulfill it. it's created, right? We don't build anything. just tell them how to do it. But then what we could do is upsell them into a group coaching where they get support or it could just not be group coaching if we don't want to have like a group offer with them and anything. But the follow up is, you know, 200 or $400 a month and I would go more with like 400 a month for ongoing support through voxer and email. So like they could ask a question and be like, I don't know what to do about this or I'm stuck. got a row of blocks. So maybe they need some brainstorming. Maybe they need us to build a formula for them to do some calculations because they can't put the things together. But what I'm thinking here is before, so we can sell it to anybody, but we'll give them some criteria for us. have to have this, right? So anything that basically spells out, you know how to make money and you're not going to risk losing your home or not beating your kids in order to make this payment and investment with us. We could do some financing offer as well, but I still would want to put this in here. And I do think we should offer financing because I think that people that we want to help most might need that kind of help. So then what we do is we have them fill out a very thorough thing form and it will help us understand what their assets are.
00:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What do you have that you have sold before?
00:29:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many times did you sell it? How much did you make over what period of time? How did you get leads and eyeballs on it? Do you currently have, you know, a flow of eyeballs, even if it's five a month on your offer? Do you have a social media following? Do you post blogs? you have a group like all of the potential ways that you have organic traffic coming to your offer? Do you You have money for an ad budget. If so, what is it? You know, we want to be able to spend at least a couple dollars a day because we could do something with that little bit, even if it's on YouTube. Are you comfortable with making videos? Have you made videos? you have a video editor? All of these types of things, right? OK. We're going to tell them $6,000 plus. You should set aside roughly $1,000 budget for contractors and ads. So we're going to minimize everything. But I think that we could get, if we needed graphics or video editing, we could get that done. And we could give them a decent ad budget with an extra $1,000 that they spend. And so part of our marketing plan would be taking stock of what they already have and who they have, right?
00:30:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And what their products are and say, OK, and we would do the same thing for them that we would do for us, which is not the best. Sorry, Chin, you want me to start writing this?
00:31:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in there because I'm not as much an auditory person like I can do whatever you like yes I do have badminton recording so um okay from there too okay okay I lost my train of thought and it's totally okay it's just the way my brain works um so so my thinking was that if we do a really um thorough written intake so if they can't express to us in writing what they have if they can't answer the intake form well we already know we're gonna have issues being successful with them okay okay um but but if they have something so we're we're going to say okay here is the most leveraged offer that we see and I would do for everybody a hard-brid thing so I would say I would um now we would do this together right and and and come to some sort of agreement kind of riff a little bit before we talk to them but I think our target should always always be help them find kind of the tier thing which is done for you done with you and DIY type of version meaning there's either a product that you buy yourself and maybe it's not done anything you don't have to do anything maybe it's just a product that you purchase but we want to figure out a value stack where there is a scaling because we want them to get their money back ASAP right and we know that the higher value things generally tend to be a bigger investment and if they were already good at packaging these things together then they wouldn't be reaching out to us so that's my premise is that they're going to need help figure out that option so then what we have to look at and is go okay what would it take to fulfill this what kind of support do you need are you going to need somebody to help you create some graphics for social media or for ads are you going to You need a video editor, know, did you because YouTube ads are going to be the least expensive if you're willing to do it and probably get you the best results in terms of getting leads. Can you write it? Do you need to go hire some copywriting help? you like some AI prompts to help you write stuff because we can help you with that? Well, um, so I think that if somebody, so what we would want to do is figure out what is the baseline of what somebody's doing like, can they, are they already generating or have they ever generated even $2,000 on selling something, selling a service or product? Maybe that number needs to be like for my clients, it's a minimum of your earning $50,000 a month and that's minimum because Even at that point generally their profit margin suck and they're not managing money. Well, it's just this weird Growth period generally it's not super optimized They hustled to get there and they're like I can't get out of this thing Whereas it's lower they're more conservative with the expenses because they need everything to count so Yes, so I thinking about what the parameters are and giving some really clear examples So a person who fits it can look at it and go yeah, that's me.
00:34:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's totally me.
00:34:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh That makes sense and then so We would do a profit calculator Well Okay, so I have different versions of this and I just plug in people's numbers and There are formulas that you can do change. So I'm going to duplicate this. This was actually something I had been thinking about for myself. Um, so let's say, um, Maria, Tina, um, joint business plan, um, and offer creation. And it's 6,000. And if we sold three a month, um, then we come over here. There's no attrition. So that's just how much it would make us. But then let's say that we upsell them to, um, private access, and it's monthly and it's $400. It's those same people. So, um, oh, sorry. Yeah, sold is three. And it's price annually, price monthly, 400. And so then that would come over, I'm thinking it was wrong with that one. Yeah, price annual, price quarterly. Yeah, anyway, we'll just do it this way, 1,200. It'll go populated like it's supposed to. It's not there's something wrong with my formula. But anyway, fix the formula. But we could do something like this with them and show them, OK, here's all you have to do. And so you play around with prices a little bit until you get a number over here that matches what they needed to be. And the first target is going to be how much money they need to make. And the second target is going to be how do they see how their investment in us has returned to them. At the very least, they should make their money back. But, you know, we'd like to at least double their return on investment and that shouldn't be hard if we're selecting the right people and just giving them the value is the clarity and the confidence. So most of the time people have stuff and they're like, yeah, but I don't, should I do this? Should I do that? And so they're not clear. And when they make a decision, they're still, I don't know if I should do this. I'm picking something. And so they hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, they don't pull the trigger, they do it and they're like two days later, it's not working and they abandon ship and they go do something else. They don't have confidence, but you can't abandon ship. It takes weeks most of time to get an offer to convert, get the ads to work well, to dial the audience in that type of thing and start actually making money. It can be different, it depends on where you're running ads, depends on how good your ad is, depends on your offer, it depends on your pricing. along all of these different things. But on average, I would say roughly around six weeks before you really get some kind of traction. So anyway, and so we can look at the different things that they offer and say, okay, so here's where people come in, and maybe it's a $5 offer. How many people do you need to make X? And if that conversion rate percentage is 2% up to the next offer, then at this price point, how much does that make? That type of thing. I've seen you do those types of numbers in your posts, but this would be something where we clear it and we'd make all the formulas correct and make sure that they're working. And so like lead magnet here, leads per month, let's say it's 500 eyeballs on there, cost per lead is, we'll say it's $2, convert to product, we'll say it's, so if you did a $3 offer, you got like 50% right?
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Conversion was 20%. Well, it's 29%.
00:39:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
29%. Price of product was $3. And so average cost probably, why not? I definitely average value per lead. Oh, yeah. So if they upsell, but then you had a $25 offering and more converted to that, right?
00:39:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Well, the average order value one day or value was about $30 as well. But then within 30 days, like they're on a thing to buy a $1,000 or $4,800 thing, but we've never ran it long enough to calculate, you know, what the conversions were on that.
00:39:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So there are some things missing in here because I was doing it as an exercise and then I stopped, but we could create something like this where we screen share and we walk them through and we would populate it with information from their intake form. They already told us about their products and they already and we would have gone and looked at them So we'll do a little research before getting on the call so that we can make that two hours and be done We're done.
00:40:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah Well, I walk people through on today's it's okay if I share screen.
00:40:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:40:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, me stop. I'm sure what I got I walked through and maybe we make an amalgamation of stuff But I walk people through today like a customer journey map, right? Like and actually was giving examples one was even yours PTM Maximizer and say you offered a six and six score of six figures six months. Okay, whatever free school please example and I share with them my you know journey map here, but then it goes into a Like this is rated live on the call with one of the people today So then it goes into a value ladder like this kind of a high-ticket ascension thing from low ticket So yeah, so her case it wasn't free. This is this was your micro offer So basically, where's your micro offers? hers was Facebook ads for financial advisors, let's say it's 1440, and then what's your order bump? 27, it doesn't have to be in order but this could just be upsell or whatever. So maybe that's better if I just say upsell, upsell one. And then I'll just, just for the remedy, I'll just take up 100 deals, pack of the safe proven, Facebook and IG proven templates. And then I asked her what does she want next, her lifestyle? Cause she does have a hot done for you stuff, like, but she said, I'd like to select her 1000 of course, that's more passive. So yeah, let's create the 100K scale fast systems on nine seven. So then it fills all this, populates this out, right? So did you build this? Yeah. Nice. So yeah, and also I have a whole ad challenge calculator, all that stuff too. then here if we work backwards so let's work backwards how much do we really want to make and she said she wants to make 15 grand a month so okay so we weren't just played to the numbers everything in blue is what you change so well let's say um you want seven sales of a thousand and and that's almost 7,000 here right let's just for easier number let's change just a thousand so i'm a graphical person right so i like seeing graphically what it is uh oops i love that so step 300k skills this is so so say we got seven sales that's seven grand and then okay well how what's the agreement going to be of the people that bought up cell one um it could be of people who just bought the micro carbon can skip step two but i like to have it up so on yeah so so this is five percent so so so in order to make 7,000 here we need 140 people here right the five percent and then that's um you know total revenue here would be 380 because the Facebook and IG templates was 27. could always change that price point and that changes this too. And it's like, okay, what's the conversion rate, people for $27, people who bought the $14, you know, Facebook ads for financial buyers, what's the conversion rate needed? An order of $1 should convert at 30 to 50% or else you're bad, you know, and an upsell should convert at about 30%, especially since it's only $27. So, 40% is very, very conservative. That's going to bring in this money and then how many, you know, sales of this micro-off you need 350 sales. So, that's a 10% conversion rate because it's only $14. Again, this could change drastically if it's like 3%. So, that's for $15,000. So, how many page visits do you need? $3,500. I have a whole ad calculator. Basically, if you're paying, say, this could be all organic, first of all, or joint ventures, know, people have your email. I'll give you a 50% commission on the front end or whatever, or it could be, hey, you're paying a dollar or $2 per click, then you can figure out your ad spend as well. So still good. If you're paying $2 per click, $7000 to double your money when it's almost passive. That's cool. So that's what we have. then like when we do it list, so moving is something pretty like this. I did your PT maximizer, say, okay, you have a school. So, so, uh, 100 days to 10k. So no less up that one. Is it here? Yeah. So I was like, okay, your value ladder was you had a school group, and you have a private time energy maximizer, 20 bucks, and then you've got 6,000, you know, 6,000 a third course and that 6,000. So wherever the course name is, right? So, so two sales, you know, that's that's 12 grand, say 5% of the people to buy profit time energy maximizer. buy it. So the thing that's wrong with this is that you could skip this middle one and just have two steps. Like, so 5% of these people, 267 people buy it, right? But anyway, say you have a 15% of your free school community buy your $20 thing, then you only need 267 people in your free school community to produce 12,800 a month, sort of. Anyway, so yeah. Yeah.
00:45:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. Yeah. Video came back and I'm like, oh, I just moped.
00:45:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. But I guess the biggest thing is, so what's the promise?
00:45:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, always work backwards.
00:45:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like, we're going to learn each other how we each work. But what's the ultimate promise? We're giving them like, for these guys, they're promises like five figure months, right? So in a six week course, they gave them all the tools to create test optimized. They had a community. Coaching forward to our calls a week, which is a lot. I wish they had accountability. Again, accountability partner who supports you on a daily basis, support by the community and chat. But there was no done for you stuff there either. And if we come back to, there's.
00:46:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, there's two articles one on one or group group.
00:46:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was the price? Yeah, group.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:46:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay.
00:46:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. What was the promise?
00:46:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You. They, they kind of are promising. So here they're levels. They have the free community. They have this mission five, six weeks. A self-employed person, you can grow your monthly sales in a relaxed manner to five digit figures. So they're promising five figures a month, whether it's 1000. Wait, no, is that 10,000? so 10,000. Yeah, they're promising 10k months then. Actually, their YouTube video was called YouTube. They had a YouTube. to video. I think it had the word 10k in it. Yeah, become part of the school revolution, learn how to easily make 10 to 15k a month with one hour day. That's, that was their promise.
00:47:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so I think that the promise is that we cut your time to actually launching your products like by 80 or 90 percent and actually make sure you do it with clarity and confidence. Because if you're trying to come up with a business plan yourself and figure out the offer, the offer is one of the hardest things for people to figure out, to figure out the price points. We could offer, so not only the offer but the hook, right? Because it's going to happen in our heads where we're going, this is why somebody would want to buy this. So the hook for the coffee is going to come out. The USP is going to come out.
00:47:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We will help you define your USP.
00:48:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We will help you define, so in your offer, that's going to be the price points, the potential order bump, upsell one, upsell two, so an entire value stack, as well as a way to create where possible. We have to put a caveat, a recurring subscription revenue, MRR for you. There is no, we can't guarantee you're going to make sales. Now we can also offer to create an ad set for them, just some really basic stuff. You've got Canva skills, I've got Canva skills, we've got people, when you put the hook, like we have some kind of templated meaning, I mean, there's just a really basic thing, there's the kind of glory shot, there's a picture of whatever the product is, or a screenshot of the result, or it depends. and all of the product is by far, right? And then a headline and then a call to action. We could do that in our sleep. So we could just go ahead and create it. We could have some different Canva templates or get a low cost person to do this for us and build that in, right? So we're gonna invest maybe bucks having so many creative graphics. But ultimately we should have somebody who's working for us build a library of ad graphics that we can use and just rotate through, changing up the color scheme, dimensions, things like that, depending on the platform. We would also give them channel marketing, channel advice, right? Here's how you put this up to Instagram. Here's and we would tell them, so like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and then Twitter, potentially LinkedIn, depending on who it is. And, basically say, okay, here's the version of the content that you use for this, this, this, and this, give them advice. And that's it. We're structuring everything for you, but also, so a lot of times, people are like, oh, I can't. I don't have anybody to help with this. I don't know how to we'll write a copy for you. You and I can rip copy out, but it is correct. We can recommend copywriters to you so you get access to our Rolodex, right? We'll introduce you to somebody to hire for copy for graphics, for video editing, for any of the things that you need. So you get our our service provider, Rolodex. And then, like, so now you have of a plan by two marketing and business mavens with a combined nearly 60 years worth of experience in business and a top level experience, making a lot of money and in a sustainable way and integrity. Right? So we've seen we've both generated millions for others tens of millions of hundreds millions from over a million for myself personally while barely working really and taking care of my kids. So what we're doing is in the matter of two hours taking all the stuff that they've had and they've been thinking about and will create multiple versions of the offer, right? Because you're The document, the calculator that you just had did that, mine does it where you can kind of mix and match, like here's the different things that you can offer. Some people will take this, people will take that type of thing, so a different kind of offer stack. We could help them define their avatar so they know who they're marketing to so that they can dial in their messaging and get really clear on their messaging. It's probably too expensive for us to pay for a similar web, if we have a few people buying this, I would love to have an account of similar web and look at their competitors and figure out how they could stand up there.
00:52:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let me ask you a question, why do you like similar web so much versus just doing like a typical, like, like, I And I'm just riffing with you here because you can see where they're paying for ads that you can't necessarily see in a Google search.
00:53:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so like there might be a place that they're running ads and spending a lot of money that you can't tell on a Google search, which means your buyers are there and you know that because because I tell them to do a abundance analysis right where you just competitive analysis, basically, where they I line competitors, what their headline headline benefits are, but I get what you're saying, so they know that that's great too. And it's probably better for somebody who's got a lot more money to spend and who can go, you know, spend money in these areas where it, but it's basically just a potential pools of customers that you can't identify.
00:53:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it's not just who your competitors are and what their offer is, but it's true.
00:53:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
are they getting their customers from?
00:53:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
00:54:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's really just market research, but yes, yeah, so and we would do that ahead of time and bring that to them to the call We wouldn't spend our time doing research on the call what we would do is show them everything that we came up with and Spend all the time making sure that they're really clear on what we figured out Hmm, I think we could do that in an hour of our own time before the calm. Yeah so They're coming away with like I can do this and then though so We would recommend and say 90% of people are going to want the follow-up because you're going to have questions and You know, this is a this is the plan, right? is $6,000 is plan It's not the support, but the support is only $400 a month and you get access to us through water If you want another call, could have all a cart kind of price for getting on a call with us. That needs to fall within our effective hourly rate of time that we're willing to do. Because the difference with the call is now I have to block off time on my calendar and we have to coordinate, whereas with Boxer I don't have to do that. So that is why Boxer can be so inexpensive. But they get the same quality really. You don't get the feeling of they've got us on a call and we've locked up our time. We have to tell them we can't make a promise that you're going to get your money back. You can make a promise that you're going to have experience that is worth the money. Because everything that we're going to teach you about your own stuff, about the offer, about how to launch it, about how to pay for support. who, who to get support, we can even make that connection, we're going to save you more than $6,000 worth of time. So let's say your effective hourly rate, theirs, so let's say $6,000, is divided by $50,000. would be 120 hours. And if you think about that, you know, somebody's, how many months do people generally spend before, like, while trying to think about product and put it together. If they actually even launch it, could Karina have launched the stuff that she did without you? right, okay. yes, we're going to show that, but we're also going to show what are the odds of and the statistics of my daughter. Also, I just realized I am missing, I just missed a train. Oh, no, did you go to it? No, I need to do this. But. I can't see the doc now so I lost my train of time.
00:57:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm going to reach, reach, get, get, go.
00:57:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, yeah. statistically, most people will. Hum and ha about trying to create an offer and it can take them years. To launch something. So they generally make their money. Just kind of hustling. And it's not a well thought out offer. It's not scalable. It's not evergreen. So they're constantly launching thing after thing hustle after hustle. They end up taking clients that they don't like just to be able to get by. And they're doing it alone. And they don't have the feeling of experts have given you validation for your offer. And I helped you structure it. Like where else are you going to get to like time tested experts who. Like, my clients pay me $1,000 an hour, they're getting two hours, but they're also getting a very specific plan and your time, and we're going to spend time doing our research and preparing for what we ever get to the call, so it's not just two hours of our time, you know, we get on a call.
00:58:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, get it.
00:58:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yeah, so.
00:58:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It sort of reminds me a little bit of, um, do you remember, did you want redend Kennedy's books ever and stuff?
00:58:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, no, I hear about them all the time. It's not audio, so I can't say, but I can't read anymore very long.
00:58:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
God, yeah, he was like, who I learned marketing.
00:59:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
from ages ago, probably 25 years ago.
00:59:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
he used to have, and I doubt if he doesn't anymore, because he's like, yeah, he's probably tired now, practically.
00:59:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's all his stuff.
00:59:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They worked together. You didn't know that? Yeah, yeah. No, you bought his stuff.
00:59:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But like, I don't think he's like working every day anymore stuff.
00:59:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he was like, his peak was 20 years back to him by now. That's right. That's right. Yeah. His peak was 20 hours, 20 years ago. Sorry, but yeah, he would have a diagnostic day where he charged 18,000 for a client to come in and spend the whole day with him. And he would map out their entire plan. if he wanted Dan or his team to build it, then that would be another fee, but he would reduce that fee by 19,000 that you paid.
00:59:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so maybe then we build in the voxel support, because again, it gives us some freedom and maybe it's for 90 days. if you want more time after that, that way the support is built in.
00:59:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's not a sticker shock price kind of thing.
01:00:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's okay so and it kind of stacks in the value right so it's more of our time um And it shouldn't be more of a commitment and I would want to make sure that they're being successful and And getting through it and maybe after we do a few of them we can figure out how to restructure it um I don't know.
01:00:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What are your thoughts? I like it because you're right you you this is something you hit nail on the head If I were to share the screen, but I know you better go soon, right?
01:00:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
many more minutes do we have until till 10?
01:00:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
already missed this training, but I'll I can watch the recording. Okay, so um They are constantly launching thing after thing because they're hustling and taking clients just to get by And they are feeling alone like that. think Is the most emotional aspect of it because that is probably so many people there and that's me too You know, um It's why I spent two thousand dollars in a micro after thing. And I'm very good at this.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I need help that much. Then I'm just like, no brainer, take my money. You know, there are other people. And so, yeah.
01:01:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and it's bespoke. Like we can kind of make it bespoke because we're not saying, well, correct me if I'm wrong, you're not thinking of the path that we're building a micro off of them, right? Like it's whatever fits their needs, right? So it's bespoke because it could be a via self funnel. It could be just a YouTube video. Like, I don't think I shared with you, but one of my friends, Carrie's doing the most amazing thing. Well, is it it's okay if I digress to another avenue, but it's just good data point for what we're teaching. So, Carrie is a guy that paid 15 grand to Ravi Abubala to scale his company. He teaches a clean business opportunity, which is meaning he teaches people how to start a remote cleaning business and he's the real McCoy. So I was this customer services manager at where Avi's company, this is a few years back. And Kari asked for a refund. He's pissed off because he's just like, you guys just want to throw Facebook ads at this to be self on it. But I'm telling you, organic LinkedIn is what worked for me. How come you're not teaching really much? He's like, the only person that ever added value here in this company was Maria. You know, so we kept in touch, right? We're good friends. And also he's, he's, he, he of went down a dark hole after that and just took a off and just, you know, he's very Christian as well. So he, that's why we stay in touch. And he was, anyway, it was all good. But to make a long story short, he just continued his organic thing and he goes, we're out. So six months ago, I'm just going to do TikTok and I can't believe in 30 days. I actually made more money than the last six months. He just went live every day on TikTok, just talking about, yeah.
01:02:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
me tell you what I'm wrong.
01:02:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think we should do that. I think so too. And then with that, well, this is where it gets interesting. With that confidence that he built and probably got boy in bed, Messer, he then went. to YouTube but not post every day or maybe not even every week but he created the most amazing YouTube organic funnel I've ever seen and he shared it with me. It's a like hour-long training but it's not like a webinar like traditional five-step webinar this is what you do the bold prompt of a lot. It was pure teaching but this is where his magic comes in. He shows his face and he's talking the video, hey look this works for me. I'm doing this is how much money making. I've all these other testimonials people doing really well with it so let me just walk you through how to start your own remote cleaning company. He goes and he opens up a Google Doc and he's got all the steps and the words to it everything so it's like a business plan of how to start a remote cleaning company and he goes listen I'd love to share this follow-along document with you underneath this YouTube video in the description just click on it all you have to do is enter your email and you will get this like he gives away the document right and then of course he's under on the thank you page giving the document click here for the Google Doc. Actually, it's a notion template underneath it. He says, if you'd like to call for me to help you with this, you know, we do have a course for this. So it was a very, very pure value, so many comments on that video saying you're the first person that's done a YouTube video or a webinar that's actually given value, this is so valuable, I can go off and do this on my own even without you, but, and then people go with him. So he's now selling a $10,000 a day to 5k packages a day through this organic funnel. Now he's going to add more fuel to it by doing Instagram lead ads or Facebook lead ads that take him to that YouTube video, but it's that YouTube video. It's different than anybody else in the marketplace is doing. He's basically given so much away.
01:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. There's a lot of, I mean, Bob Berg talks about go giving, right, the go-giver stuff, and, the thing, and that's why I've thought about, you know, I would just give away the profit time and do max. because it teaches people what to do, but if they know that I can do that for them in an hour for free, why wouldn't they spend money with me if they've got money to spend it? Yeah. So we could do that exercise, you know, make it a video where we take somebody through it live and, you know, make it a real-time thing and offer it to somebody in the group, say, hey, this is what we want to do. want to make this a video. It's going to be on YouTube. you know, you're, you have to be willing to answer these questions. You can look at it in advance to know if you're okay with that, but this is what we want to do. And then the other thing that we could do is we could do one of these offers, free offer reasons, and do that with somebody. You know, somebody who can will take that and just like, thanks, I'll just go do it myself. Great. We don't need everybody. We don't like to force it. Well, the month, you know, so let's say 200 people see it and 196 of them do it themselves.
01:06:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And four people say, I need Tina and Maria to do it for me.
01:06:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know what I mean? So that's the power of abundance. And I do think that that's actually a much better model. I think that you get higher quality followers and bands that way. Yeah, I think that you they tell more people about you. And I think that's where, and also when there's this is what I know about people that have a lot of money, there's no barrier to entry and they can see everything that you know. They'll just reach out to you and they'll just say, look, I they'll offer you money. They'll say, I want to work with you. Here's a whole lot of money. Can I get some of your time because they already know, you know, and you didn't just give this away for free. Yeah. Yeah. And we, I really do think though that TikTok is the thing. I think, I think it's a fresh audience. think that are a lot of people who don't know anything about anything. So I don't think they're brainwashed. Um, internet marketers in Facebook and Instagram is the same because it's not the same. It's definitely different audience, the different people. But meta knowing what meta knows about everybody kind of puts people in this echo chamber of similarity. And TikTok is different. It's a completely separate algorithm with different data points of different, well, different algorithm. And then YouTube. So I would want to create the lives on on TikTok. And then so YouTube doesn't care about consistency. TikTok does and frequency. Very, very much. algorithms are about going live very frequently and when people are on and interacting with them. YouTube cares about how long people watch your content so quality because when they're serving up and it's just like you know SEO with Google like if you're bouncing up their pages they're not going to rank you high it doesn't matter if you stuff all the keywords in there if people aren't saying page then obviously they're not happy with what YouTube has served up and people won't stay on YouTube if they go search for something and YouTube gives them a video that's boring they don't like it whatever so they care about that you create it does not matter how consistent it just matters that the content is good yeah yeah so if we create that offer and so two videos that we could do is walk through the PTE maximizer with somebody and just gift it to somebody who has Sunday thing, leverageable, where they're like, because they're already making money. Maria, like anybody else is like, I've been doing this a while, I make money. But I don't feel like I've just like, I'm crystal clear on somebody like, I get up and I know what I'm working on every day. I don't stress about it. The money is there, money easily, even when I don't know what I'm doing, I don't spend my will too much. Because I know what my most leveraged things are. And I get to it. Because once I've learned it, I always learn it. You're not going to stop forgetting that. most people aren't that way. So that's the gift that we give somebody, but they have to have something that is clear, like a real estate agent showing houses versus making phone calls. They needed to have somebody else make the phone calls. They should be showing houses. That's like a sales call. So a salesperson doing sales calls versus writing copies. Somebody else should be writing the copy.
01:09:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They should be on the call because that's where the magic is.
01:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's everything. For some people, it might just be creating videos, creating YouTube videos, creating TikTok videos. So your guy that you just talked about, his thing would be teaching and making sure that people actually know what they need to know so that they want to come and buy the things for them. So it's basically just informing his audience and that goes to people through the level of awareness by teaching them in different things about their business. So anyway, so we could create a really quality video walking somebody through that exercise and we can deal it a few times. So you've got a few different versions of the video. We can break that up into little shorts that we put on TikTok. We could break it up. We could make it a long, you know, whole-contained video on YouTube with some shorts also. And we could put it out too. We could put the bits, know, to the other platforms. I think if we focused on TikTok for live engagement, YouTube for low-cost leads, low-cost, high quality, targeted leads, think it's been very little money and do very well if we've got a great offer, and if we're demonstrating our value through the videos.
01:11:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, which, yeah, I always believe like the Eve Hutton thing, like when I open my mouth, they listen to me. I always know that, right? But it's just getting visible, right? Still about getting visible. So, TikTok for live interaction or engagement, as it is. Yeah. YouTube. Long-term growth. didn't even say those exact words, but something like that.
01:11:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
TikTok is so for low-cost. high quality leads targeted, but the content that we put there would be longer and higher value in that it's a complete picture, like girl trainings.
01:12:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so now Kari, here's his channel, Boring Business Growth Hub and Boring Business. I love that. Yeah, yeah, he's really funny. You'll love him. He's a really cool guy. Um, so yeah, so anyways, like he's he keeps pumping stuff out, but here's build, build a tent. In this video, we will overview the process of obtaining a trial. That is an ad. Hold on. A version of REX. All right, you guys. So in this video, we are going to be talking about building a. So he looks like a nice guy. He is. He created a four part series. And then if you haven't watched part one of this training, make sure you do go here. Like, so it's like a flywheel. Welcome to my YouTube channel, we show you how to build a remote cleaning business. It's just so good. his promise is $10,000 a week, by the way. don't think he has a guarantee on it anything, but he certainly has people who achieve it. But again, he goes follow along, so he goes, share the resources you will need, grab every single one of them. So he's got a follow along document here. you click here, and it comes over here, get you copy the follow along document, get my document. So we could totally create this kind of, I call it a mouse trap too.
01:13:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is our cheese. And I've been seeing that too, like that exactly, that's the model. And what I love about TikTok, and you can do it with YouTube too, is that we can join each other. So you can go live with another person. Because my biggest thing is I don't want to talk to myself. I don't want to talk to you, the ethers. I love to talk to Maria, and I think that we would riff so good. There might be other people that we might want to do additional conversations with them, so one great thing about TikTok is you're doing that type of thing with other people, so you get their audience, they get your audience, so if we're strategic about it and we're not overlapping the exact type of stuff, or just having abundance mindset know that it doesn't matter if we're not overlapping, because some of their people will like us better, some gave them all the gifts by letting them see that there's something else available.
01:14:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, and he's making money, he says he's making about 4,000 a month now recurring, just because people are, this is his go-high level version that you know, say even if you don't buy my course, here's the booking software mandatory. cannot automate your business without it. We will use the software during the training 14-day free trial, and this is his go-high level snapshot for a cleaning business.
01:14:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that, and that is the other thing I want to do like I hate spending money where it's not making me money but I think that there is a lot um available in I mean go high level will pay for itself very quickly if we create our own snapshot and sell it as low cost so um I've got a girl that could help build that honestly we could probably build some of ourselves but uh and I don't know what they would be but like your micro offer whatever we come up with for these people um maybe we could say for the first um 10 people who buy this will build the automations for you in high level and if you we can put it in your own high level account don't have one get it through us yeah now we've got some people um buying it and uh so we could spend a little bit of money but we'd have the money coming in where we could spend that little bit and I've got a great girl that we could do it I have the ability to build some stuff too we can go with Dan so Anyway, we could make some money quickly with that, I think.
01:16:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think so. This could easily become, if we wanted to, 25K product, this is better than any masked maniac. I still have my friend, a frickin Russell Brunson, 25 grand for their inner circle mastermind, whatever. all they just taught them how to do a challenge, here's your challenge course, and you could get on group coaching calls, that's it.
01:16:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's all they provided. said to me, what the hell? Which they ripped off of Seth. What? Which they ripped off of Seth, from Seth.
01:16:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, no, wasn't that kind of challenge. No, it was like a live, five day challenge, like I used to teach and stuff. Oh, okay.
01:16:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, because Pedro Adao taught Russell Brunson how to do stuff, but Pedro got it from Seth.
01:16:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Pedro, well, Pedro teaches live challenges, like Pedro got it from Jason Flatt, and he got it from me. Because back 12 years ago, and. And Jason said it, Maria, you're the OG of doing challenges.
01:17:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You had 30,000 people go through your page. Girl, how did I never hear about you?
01:17:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, because like I didn't continue with one thing. Like I just shot an object.
01:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
did so many different things.
01:17:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that's how. And so Jason created Pedro, because that was when I was doing stuff with Jason about eight years ago still. And Jason's like, Maria, I just got to tell you something. said, I'm going to help Pedro break out into the big group space, because I hate how it's all close knit group and stuff. He's done a few live challenges like you, but I know you're the OG, but he's kind of using a new modern way of Facebook groups and stuff. go, Jason, I'm using Facebook groups now too. Like when we used to do it eight years ago, yeah, we used just go to webinar. And that's it, because Facebook groups didn't exist back then. But I was, oh, I didn't realize that. But Peter had already paid Jason like 25 grand to get coached on it. So Jason then introduced him to all the other people. So I'm like, oh my God. So that's how Pedro got all the big name clients.
01:18:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
initially to and then that success breeds success right so we had this first few wins big name points and yeah yeah so there is and and to me this is not a shiny object again I like multiple options first of all because I do so it satisfies the shiny object by having different things I could bounce to but they're all within the same room so we could do a challenge around an offer like your marketing offer and we could teach people to do what we're going to do for somebody else right so if you want to put your own brain power in it but if you've got enough money that you would rather us do it so that you're really confident you did it right yeah and you want that one-on-one time because I would do that I don't I don't want to be in the group I don't want to have the group conversation not when I have money buy of money I just want to get it done fast right so some people don't have the money but they need the path and and that would be you are kind of give back thing. We put them through a challenge, sell it cheaper, but it's the same thing we're doing. So we're not jumping around from type of offer to type of offer. It's all about get started, get clear, and leverage and optimize your offer for a sustainable business that you keep running. It's an evergreen offer. So back to the fundamentals, like we're not here if you want to do launch after launch after launch after launch. You have to have something of value that has lasting quality and value. If you want to do the launch fine but we're not talking to you about that, we're not suggesting it because that's rework, then you're building yourself into a job of having to come up with the next thing. We don't advise that. That's hustle and grind mentality that will take a toll on your health, mentally, physically, emotionally on your relationships, and we don't. on anything to do with that. best of luck to you. Bye. Yeah. Um, now, if you would like to build a business that can support you, that can allow you to fill your purpose in life and serve the people that you feel called to serve, but be able to make money where you're not stressing about it and worrying about it. And then build something that has a compounding benefit where you're earning more month over month, year over year. Let's talk. Here's the system for that. Here's what you need to know, figuring out how to make it work takes a while. So, you need emotional support. That's what the group is for. You need structural support. That's what our plan is for. And then you just need to keep on keeping on until it works. And we've got the experience to show you what happens if you get stuck in a pitfall and you can come to us for help. That's what your money goes for.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just create, you just take that part of the recording.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's the manifesto.
01:21:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it. It's awesome. I loved what you said when you feel called to serve. So I love it. That's a good way to end this call. know you got to go.
01:21:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So okay. So I get you supposed to so happy. I feel like our calls are so productive and we get a little bit clearer, but I also feel like we're going to give so much to people anyway.
01:21:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So what are the next steps? you want me to put together like a small offer dock and then you just go at your magic and just revise it and stuff?
01:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That would be the best thing for me. if we were to like this, that would be great.
01:21:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So it comes out of me verbally, very quickly and pretty clearly.
01:21:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Putting it onto a document for whatever reason, generally I will pause. But if somebody starts the document, then I'm like, oh no, this, I did this. And then the structure gets really clear, really fast. And then we pick steps, tasks, assignments, due dates, execute, and then voila.
01:21:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So I'll do that this afternoon. I'm just going to go and pick up my dog. And then I got my nails appointment and uh no I love it because because then we literally probably could launch this early next week like um I mean if we get it done earlier Friday Saturday we could but I think I'm traveling this weekend I'm going go see my sweetheart and he's taken to me to a football game so I'm I'm being out of pocket for a few days or not see your sweetheart what he doesn't live where you live where does he live no he's in Arizona Vegas he's got a few different houses but generally Arizona Vegas gotcha gotcha I used to have a house in Arizona Vegas in my real estate days when I was flipping luxury homes um so okay so is Monday feasible if you want to do what's um Monday's always kind of rough for me anyway because I have a lot and I'm not getting in until like one o'clock in the morning so let's do Tuesday okay that's cool and what we can do uh yeah so I'll start on the google doc and we'll just refine it refine it and uh this will be some gosh I'm even thinking maybe I think, well, so a lot. We got to maybe limit it so we make sure that it's good.
01:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As we get clear on it, once you set an intention and you get really clear on it, people magically and it's not magically, it's synergistic, and I think it's God. But it's asking you shall receive, and you can call it lot of attraction, doesn't matter, once you get clear on it, things just start happening. So if somebody comes along and you're like, I have this perfect offer for you, and you're want to sell it, just sell it, and then we'll fulfill it and we'll figure out the details. I'm just saying, in that amount of time, knowing you and the conversations that you have and because we got clear, there may come an opportunity where you're just like, I could sell this to this person right now, sell it, get paid, we'll fulfill it, we'll deal with money up later.
01:23:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it. Yeah. And then also just go back to the thing about Seth and this counseling, yeah, like I know my friend Cindy Mulcaney, she loves Seth and I I remember she thought Seth's thing, that's why I bought it. And she said she was going to see that's an interesting person for me to reach out to. She never launched it. Like, she wanted to launch the thing like Seth. And she's doing other stuff, don't be wrong. She's making money and doing good stuff. But I just got a feeling it's like her, that would be a perfect client, too, because it's like, I mean, it launched it. Like, you said you're going to do it. You bought one Seth thing, all excited about it. And instead, she went all down the path of the AI, which is still good. And she's offering some kind of AI coaching offer, and a go high level affiliate. But still, it's sort of like, you know, she believed in something and then she never launched it. So what happened? we're here to go in for helping people in between that.
01:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, I think that's the issue. So people have been Yes, it is. It's doubt and it's too much work, and I need help. I don't know how to hire people. Seth can't hire people. Seth cannot manage a business.
01:24:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
He can't. He will never happen.
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not talking bad about him. His genius is just he cannot, will not do it. He will jump to all kinds of other things in order to avoid actually structuring things. And he doesn't even know where to start. And so literally saving him. And we don't, we see people like that and we don't know because we see their strengths. But that's the truth is that most people are thinking and so beneath their potential because they need support of some sort. So here's, we could do $10,000 done for you. And here's why I think that would be a good thing. We could take that money, put it into getting support in a person building an automation. But then we're building a snapshot at the same time that we own. So we give them their version of it and then we keep a generic version of it. Doesn't have their copy, doesn't have their anything. But, so I don't think we build too much work for ourselves if we do that for you, because we can whip out, like I can write copy, we could just literally talk about an offer, the copy will come out of my mouth.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm pretty sure you could do the same thing if we do some research.
01:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we would literally just have to transcribe it and then go have it edited into it, it'd be so easy. We could do the same thing with the email follow-up sequences, like we could spend maybe 10 hours for $10,000, you and I would both be well paid. You'd have enough money for a couple of months, comfortably, well, if you got it all, if you didn't, we have it one month and we could sell anyway. So I'm just telling you, those are some options to think about, because I know you know people, and I think God is going to give you, I think he's going to show you who you need to talk to and who you can help. So, you're not allowed own. You're not doing all the work. You're not going to be overburdened. If the person that you know needs this is available, sell it, take the money, get paid, know that you're taking terms, we will fulfill it very quickly.
01:27:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Thank you. Okay, let's go. So, send me the recording when it's ready, when I have time, that'd be great. So I could take a look at the notes and I'll create the Google Doc. I'll have that done by the end of the day today for sure. Okay. have to craft it, not like done done.
01:27:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I will go to do that right now and then launch my missionary meeting because this is devotional so I want the prayers and all that goodness.
01:27:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Nice. All right, all right, talk to you later.

Hey, hey.
00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, What's going on? When did I need my name?
00:00:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Because I'm sick. Sick has got the blood drawn yesterday morning and you're just having.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, my daughter came home sick and she got. So I've got my inhaler and been taking my silver and I already feel better but I'm still like.
00:00:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Got it.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then this morning my daughter comes in and she's flashing light in the darkness in my eyeball. And I'm like and I never say Jesus Christ and I say Jesus Christ.
00:00:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry.
00:00:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was like, I thought she was talking about my daughter for a minute.
00:00:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It could be a dog.
00:00:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Dog. I walk out and I smell this god-awful smell. I'd never smelled before and The dog was filming at the mouth.
00:01:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm like what's going on. I'm like it's got me a skunk But it didn't smell like a skunk, but it was filling up my whole house the smell Oh God.
00:01:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it smelled like chemically and Not like a skunk, but it had to have been just a weird skunk We've had these experiences before it did permeate through the whole house if my daughter Mm-hmm up just smelling her dog. Yeah, she got sprayed right in the mouth dog So that's how I woke up and it wasn't even seven o'clock yet in the morning Yeah, so that on top of being sick and we had like body aches in my just yeah But and I feel good enough I get the job done, so Walk up and did my missionary stuff and I snuck like a shower during one of the calls because we're not on video and I muted myself and I'm like I'm just gonna listen and get my shower and right after I got out they like had a question for me so I'm like nobody knows and it's okay so so what did you do with the dog then what's happening with the dog right now she's okay okay yeah she it just had happened so she hadn't processed it and body but she had some water and she was too a lot just making that face and she's okay and I couldn't believe how much this because we have medical grade at HEPA filters throughout the house since COVID but also we all have asthma and the pollen around here is insane yeah so it did a really good job of clearing out smell pretty well and I can't believe it. leave because I prayed. I'm pretty sure miracles are just happening because the oils in the skunk are just they're pervasive. They take a long time to dissipate and go away. She didn't get a bath or anything but it's yeah it's the worst and the best skunk experience we've ever had. Worst as in how bad it was but best isn't how quickly it's it's like we still smell it but anyway she's okay she's out barking her head off right now. Oh my gosh and you're on fire yeah your pad just being like breaking it down. I watched while I was on my training for a minute because there were some because there was the board so I was like that's awesome.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah yeah no yeah yeah I'm excited and I had a really good call this guy yesterday that's potentially more like just for me on the off offer stuff because he had a funnel builder that was doing stuff for him and that funnel builder just changes business model to not have any customers anymore and he's just gonna focus on his own offers. So he was wondering if I could take over and run ads for him and all that jazz. So I'm like, okay, cool. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah, that's kind of what's happening now is is to later on today, I told him said I want him to think I was a what do you go? Desperate of this that so he asked if I could send him just a detailed either a contract or or send him a details of what's more out of scope. That's what he'd like to learn more about. Not what's in scope. was going and so 5,000 months didn't phase him at all. So let's do it for 90 days, but obviously if you don't like it or you're You don't like it, you know, whatever, like I'm not going to hold you to the 90s, but I feel we should have that at least, but you got legs like I looked at his funnel. He just needs to optimize it. And I think it'll rock for him. And I also believe I don't know if you're like this now to I don't believe high ticket sells so well in this economy. So he needs in the real estate niche. He's a realtor. He's very successful what he does. And he's got a great book.
00:05:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think he wants to become like the next brand new chart, which I think is really cool. I don't it's the economy.
00:05:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I want to talk after that. Okay, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, we love to talk. This is that is a podcast episode or video for us to do. So, but yeah, so he's trying to send them into a $3,500 thing. And I said, you know, honestly, if I run your shoes, I really feel you should have more 500 or 900 or 300 thing to assemble too. And I think that's going to make you 50k months easily with this funnel because the real estate niche have been in it. I'm very experienced and I even how I was there when Chris Michore just started because I was with the ad agency So, you know, saw her when she was nobody and everybody knows who she is, but she started in real estate now She teaches all things business, but uh, so anyways, um, yeah He's certainly open to that because I really feel You're setting yourself up for fail failure because then you have a sales team then you gotta deal with this and he doesn't want that He makes good money in his real estate business.
00:06:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He doesn't want to deal with that or manage people.
00:06:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So anyways Um, he's Looked like he's a yes. Uh, yeah yesterday on the phone. He and he on zoom call We energetic are really aligned the Ford for his book was written by one of his friends who's Bob Berg of the go-giver So like he's very heart centered Um, person so um, anyways, I understand he just wants to know what's in scope. What's not in scope Is it okay? I'll just craft you I told him I'd do it tomorrow, is today So once I have that then that will alleviate a lot of pressure to have five thousand Coming in for that, plus he's a fun guy to work with.
00:07:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I thought as soon as you said the price point, and for 90 days I'm like, okay, that just created the space that you need it. But it's actually because, but what you also need is you need the boon of what's been, what you've been having to deal with is the energy of it. wouldn't say it started with Carina, but it definitely maybe was probably most noticeable and painful with Carina of not being respected. That is an emotional heart pain, and you had Rudy, and I'm coming from these kinds of experiences as well. I'm speaking because I know what they feel like to not be honored, especially when you show up and give everything.
00:07:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, yeah, let me turn my box around. And this is to have some
00:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
but nickel and dime you.
00:08:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, try to be miserly with you.
00:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But say, I see your expertise at that price makes sense to me, at least like it isn't a done deal yet. But yeah, once you start dealing with people who honor you, you are your energy is completely different. You're not coming from a defensive and making space and now your creativity flows.
00:08:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Also your generosity increases because your fear can diminish because you know that there are good people out there.

It's very cathartic and releasing and powerful. But when you're already a generous person, it actually increases your generosity because somebody kind of restored your faith and humanity a little bit, you know. But something to think about. So in terms of the economy, there is just as much money as there always has been. If not more, it has shifted. There's a greater priority, but the bigger issue. is the economy of trust. The trust economy has what's been most damaged. So there are too many people stealing and promising big things. And hey, I'm so and so, and you just get my time. You get access to me, you get access to my community.
00:09:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's worth $10,000, it's not.
00:09:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need results for $10,000. So and most of these things are just, here let me throw all of this information at you, but there are a lot of gaps. It's not actionable. There, there isn't a support system where you can ask a specific question where you need to get. So for most people, they have realized, so this is the trust part, it's part of the trust is that they need, if they're going to spend that much money, it needs to get them a certain level of results. They're really, like people didn't ask this question. and have this realization that they're giving to you this week, which is I need an implementer because they realize they're not the one. So people that used to throw money away and the whole just kind of energy that you could do this throw money away and you would get something out of it doesn't exist anymore. There's a whole new market, but the market is coming in more educated realizing I can't just give five or ten thousand dollars and my life is going to change. So that's the big issue. can't there will be people who will pay money just for access, right? that's one thing that's my guy who's always told people people will pay for access and that's true. They will pay a lot of money to get into somebody's world. But that's not everybody. That's a small person and that person already knows what the value and the benefit of being in
00:11:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
in that connection is, right?
00:11:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the results, they've already calculated, they've already done that. Everybody else, which is the majority of the people need to have a tactical result, which is this thing that I can't talk myself into building, or I can't even comprehend how to build front like backwards and forwards, where I can build, but I don't know how to mark it, where I can mark it, but I don't know how to build that kind of thing that there's always one of those gaps, right? Yep. They need to have that solved. So for the person selling something, the person selling has to decide what do I want to deal with, okay? So we already know what we want to give and what we can sell and what we can offer, but there's a burden involved in fulfillment. So if the thing is we want to help realtors be better realtors. I want to help realtors be better realtors, but I just want to share with them what I know. I don't want to deal with customers. support. I don't want to deal with one on one calls. I don't want to deal with live events, right? So then you get a lower ticket thing that just says, here's what you can learn, okay? I just created a material for you. I don't have a lot to deal with it, so I'm going to give it kind of inexpensive, but I can give it over and over and over again because I know how valuable it is. So that person, you know, your guy who doesn't want to do a lot might consider that. The other thing he can consider is bringing in so maybe you create community and then you're looking for the excited kind of go-getters or the experienced person and then you deputize them and go, hey, would you be interested in being a moderator? Would you be interested in being a junior coach or whatever? And so now they build into the model, you take somebody that you acquired through the funnel to begin with to be a leader and those leaders, they're different because they're also loyal now. not like you went out and hired somebody. They found you, they already been sold and converted and they drank the Kool-Aid. So they're ideal to support your community and now you can charge a higher tier because now you can offer support but you're not doing it. You're facilitating it, you're paying for it, you've created a system that brings the leaders in, you create a system that can train the leaders so you can train your trainers but you don't actually do it. So he could be working with some high level people on occasion which helps him keep his saw sharp and just you know keeps tucked into his business and so like if the market ever just crashes he's got this other thing over here. love the market crashes he's not going to be a selling that very well. But anyway something to consider about that but I don't think so the economy is definitely bad but it's really mostly bad for people who struggle to get jobs in the first place. who, so for entrepreneurs if they're targeting broke people That was already an issue, which is Karina.
00:14:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And that's why her business. So I had put the glasses on and I prevent ice cream. Yeah, I really feel that sort of Karina in a way happened to her with her list. And that's why. Yeah, because they just weren't responding anymore. Like it was hard to get sales from the compared to a year ago. Same emails, right? So, yeah.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so that target matters. the people, but everything flows uphill, right? So, food chain. So if these entrepreneurs were targeting the rogue people who barely had money to begin with, who were just thrown it out because they couldn't, they're not getting paid. So these people that used to pay these people, these people aren't getting as much money. some of these people are creative and pivoting. So some of these people are getting that money. But these up here, you know, they're like having different conversations and pivoting more. So the majority of the shortage is here. The next level is here. The next level is here and so on. So the money and the money is flowing up, the shortage, but it's still there, it's still being generated and it's still being spent, it is the difference of who's targeting whom. Are you targeting people that have money or are you adjusting your offer to make it more available to them? But in addition to that, are you shifting what you're offering and support so that if you reduce your revenue, you're also reducing your burden, right? So maybe I'm still helping you, but I'm not giving you the one-on-one hand holding, because this price point doesn't allow me to do that, but I still want to lift you up and help you. Yeah.
00:15:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that make sense?
00:15:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, that's my feeling about how it's going, because there's still a lot of people just throwing money just going, yeah, no problem.
00:15:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've evidenced by the sudden guy reached out to me, he sold his
00:16:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
company after the harmoses and so he wants to start a new funnel in the fertility nation wondering if I can help with that and they said yeah sure uh so you know we're just uh I should need to get back to them too so after we finish this call I need to go back to these people that are hanging loops what do you call it unfinished loops I would be happy to help you create your really clear and don't don't create the potential for scope creep because I don't want to see you be stressed out for your own reasons but for my selfish reasons too because then if you're stressed out then I don't get to play against myself yeah yeah yeah how must you do you mind if we a you You
00:20:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You Back hey, oh my god. She's painting the like she bugs me for food I gave her her food and then she walks away from her nose turned up Yeah, yeah Cuz she wants I put sometimes put a little bit of sliced ham on it, but I'm not gonna do that every single meal for her So she didn't like that. Yeah, she didn't eat it at lunch at two hours ago So I picked up put it back in the fridge with those cuz the wet food and expensive. It's like $4.50 for a little can of this cat food and she goes through a can of day and plus her dry food and so she turns and knows about it and so I put in the fridge and then now she was bugging me bugging me for food and so I put it back down on her when I was making my coffee and she looks at me and walks away.
00:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's hilarious. Is it too much cheaper than that?
00:21:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um you know it some of it is special ones on sale um that is Canadian dollars so 450 is probably 350 US or excuse me um but um I have given her tuna sometimes too but I guess with the special product a more holistic brand it has kind of more in it but the problem is she likes chicken flavored and Merlin the burnadoodles are allergic to chicken so if he gets in the cat food that's why he lifted he then gets the runs like the night two nights ago I was up three times during the night because he kept pawing at me go outside so you know it's not nearly as much of the painting you had this morning food.
00:21:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah and then I had to change their dog food um It's always like throwing up or dragging their butts across the ground and there's a lot of stuff outside that they can get into so I don't really know what's what but I was reading how much corn is in all the dog food and how bad it is to digest for any any of us really but so I got some food from Chewy that doesn't have any corn in it and they've been a lot better but yeah I can't see no little fur babies got to take care of them I know I know they are beautiful like oh no she's eating her wet her dry food so she said no to the wet food that's really expensive and the dry food is expensive nowadays too but anyways now she's stomping at that oh my god anyway um yeah so did you see my video that I did on my facebook page today I saw part of it I didn't get to see all of it but I thought that was awesome yeah and who I'm calling out now 50,000 And I'm embedding the seed, right?
00:23:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
yeah, if I come over here, so, yeah, 50k months from different parts, I'm just kind of embedding the seed. So, so, yeah, yep. All right, so I got this going. Let's go. You cool to start on this now or is that.
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, let's do it. So, I think the fastest way to start would be what do you already know that he wants to do so that what is the existing goal? Actually, that would be that's what I do is I reverse engineer every single time. What is the outcome that is desired? And then I work backwards and think about what has to happen to make that. And then I figure out what is the simplest way to accomplish that and what are the guardrails to make sure that I'm not. called out of it. If there's potentially something that could scope creep, I build that in and say, okay, if this needs to happen, you will pay for this. Maybe I'll manage it. Maybe I'll lead it, whatever. But just to be clear, if this is needed, I'm not doing it.
00:24:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. So he's got a couple outcomes desired. I'll just write them all down and then we can succinctly make it better if you want. So so the first thing is that the overall big outcome is that his avatar of and obviously this isn't going to go in a minute like this of who he wants to become is like a Brooke Castillo.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know Brooke Castillo? No.
00:24:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. She is the owner of owner of the life. Basically he wants to become a high-performance coach like a Tony Robbins Brooke Castillo. Okay. Or Brandon Bouchard, right? owner of life. So he wants to use the real estate RE course as a springboard to other other missions. don't know what you want to call it, but EG, he has a productivity course course. I think he'd love to have a relationship course. This is down the road like he'd like to just help people, right? His offer is called, his name's Grant Mueller.
00:25:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know ever heard of him. He sounds very all over the board.
00:25:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, no, no. This is for long term. No, I could just go into the short term. Why call me? just you know that it's good, but it does help to have the overall thing. Yeah. So, I mean, the initial scope is basically optimizing this funnel. Also, he'd like to get to let me find the actual URL top of that yeah top of heart offer and this is converting not bad it's at 7% conversion so it actually isn't bad um he showed me the conversions but uh top of hearts he booked Bob Berg's written the four that's his friend as well but um you know as far as uh you know if we were just to go down to the real outcomes that he wants to um make a profit with this uh little ticket funnel funnel and that's called top of heart offer make a problem that's um he also said that it'd be he says i can afford the 5k right now no problem but it's coming out of my real estate business but i'd like your 5k month to be funded from this event as well. But basically, I think you'd like to get to 20k profit per month. I need to say an exact number. He kind of just said he wants to make it profitable. So let's just get rid of this.
00:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is it currently like, does it lose money?
00:27:23 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What is that? Yeah, so the history is he hired this other guy, Vinny, to create the funnel like two, three months ago and run ads. And so the deal he had with him is that he charged in 10,000 to build the funnel and doesn't include up so one or upsell two, which is kind of like my little ticket offer. But he also runs ad for it. And because he knew that he had a $3,500 high ticket, he said, when you make your $10,000 back in sales of your high ticket, then I'll charge you $5,000 a month for continuing run ads and optimize the funnel. So Vince, a few weeks ago, decided to stop doing being an agency, um, you stopped everything. And he still likes Vince. He says, a good guy, but I have no one now, right? So the goal is to make it profitable. So he didn't really have the greatest numbers right now. And he was embarrassed about it, but said, I kind of need to know your numbers. He shared screen yesterday into his go ahead level account. That's why I knew he was converting at two at 7%. But no, he's, I don't know if he's profitable. I say no, because his average order value is probably only between seven and $10 because he had zero conversions of his order bump and zero conversions of up cell one. So I said, okay, right there, I know I can help you tremendously. So I already know you're under water because you're probably paying at least $40 cost per purchase. But I didn't want he was going to give me access to account. But I said, no, until we have a working relationship, I don't want to work, like expand my brain energy on that. But I know I can help you.
00:28:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So how where is his current lead to coming from?
00:28:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It's a new funnel. So paid traffic, Facebook ads.
00:29:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And what's, what's he paying? What's he getting? How many eyeballs are seeing it?
00:29:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't know.
00:29:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's what I mean. I didn't want to look at his eyes. Okay. Okay.
00:29:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You don't know about it. Yeah. Yeah. Um, basically in the last, like, I think Monty had like 29 buyers. oh, he said he was spending 15, uh, I guess Vinny's deal with he does with people. He was spending 15, uh, $50 a day. And he's been running it for about six weeks. He said, these are all like, what happened, which I thought was kind of . But I'm not going to go into detail, slam, anyone or anything. But, um, because there's always two stories to it. Um, there was a slack channel that Vinny had with his clients that had all these numbers on it. And, uh, Vinny closed the slack account down. So, all that was gone. But still, that's up to him as the entrepreneur that he should have had a Google Sheet that showed weekly ad spend weekly So he also didn't know what he doesn't know, but he really, ideally the outcome is make this profitable, use it as a once he kind of feels he has it dialed in and knows doing like maybe launch other low ticket offers. Right now it's, you know, $7 offer. And he's got a lot of bombs and all that that I'd have to totally redo because they're not working. To a $3,500. I take it. Take it with more coaching. So, so the outcome desired is simply. Yeah, make a profit with the little take a funnel right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that that includes paying for me but I'm not going to say that in the document here. Oh, yeah.
00:30:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
let's do some quick math. which I shouldn't, I mean, basically, 5,000, 100 hours, hold on, let me do that. I thought, no, that's right. So roughly, if we were going to keep your EHR at 500, we'll, we'll make it 250, because 250 is still better than you've been doing, right? if you worked 20 hours a month for roughly five hours a week, that's roughly an hour a day. So that's I'm not saying that that's what you should do. And I don't think that you're necessarily in a situation to do that. I think you can do much better. And I think that even if you spend two hours a day for him every day, which would be 10 hours a week, which would make your effective hourly rate about $50, hold on a second, that's 5 out of 40, $125 an hour. So if you worked two hours a day, every pre-day of the week, your EHR would be about $125 an hour, which is still not bad. And I think that this is a process that you should do on a regular basis, just to kind of have an idea before you say yes, no to anything, whatever.
00:32:13 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And also it helps create the kind of scope.
00:32:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
in the two hours a day, there's a lot that you could do. There's a lot of research, there's a lot of copywriting, there's reporting time, there's all kinds of things that would go into. One of the things I always do for my clients, which very few people do for them, is I set up something for them and then make them owners. So I used to use base camp. Now I'm using Trello because base camp is more expensive and it's more convoluted than it used to be. And Trello is still very simple. It's just camben boards and I can invite them and then I can make them owner, where you can't do that with base camp. You can't somebody to an admin owner whatever. But that way, because you want to teach them, and this is a gift that you're giving them. to own their reporting, own their data, own their stuff, no matter who they work for. So a lot of people, and this is again kind of my leadership style and what I give to them is I teach them, delegate, don't abdicate, but most people abdicate. They say, they think, I give you my money, this is your responsibility now, no, because they don't care about your business like you do, they don't, you know, all that, anyway. So, so keeping all of these in mind, one of the things I would do is, let's say, and I would write this down, and I can, I can take some bottom notes too, but I would start with one of the things I'm going to do for you is create a project management suite there. So it's going to be a Trello board where we're going to track all of the things that are going to get done, and I'm going to task by everything so that you will be able to see what I'm doing, when it's due, or whatever is doing, if we end up hiring somebody to do something, and you will be be able to see everything that happens as it happens and you'll have a record of it moving forward. So if you want to duplicate this across another one of your products, you'll have the project mapped out that you could find what's usable and duplicated to the next one. So this is an asset I'm creating for you that you'll be able to use again and again. Because now you're value-stacking, right? not like I'm just not just getting you the money that you want. I'm creating assets and value that are going to have compounding benefits for you. But the other part of that is now you've got something that shows your work and keeps people from breathing down your neck. Well yeah but Maria didn't get me the results, I didn't get the sales, I wanted whatever. Okay well you can see Maria strategically went down through the list and your offer still didn't convert. know that because you can't make everything convert well whatever. There's a lot that goes into that. Anyway, so the next thing I would do, but I would have done this before coming into it since your job is conversion, I would have looked at the ads. And I would have looked at the ad account because just even though you know the conversion rate, you don't know how bad or good the ads are. Like if they're really good ads and he's spending $50 a day and can only get that, that's a red flag, that's an issue, that means you're going to have an uphill battle.
00:35:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, because because he doesn't have his funnel done, it's only front end funnel at seven bucks.
00:35:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, so that's an additional part, but if you have a hard time getting even front end sales with $50 a day, then that would be a concern that I would have, but if it was a really good ad, I doubt that that's the case, but I would have wanted at least that much information before I said yes for sure, like, at least show me one of your ads, so I know and look at it and go, yeah. There's so much opportunity.
00:36:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, he was willing to put me on the ad account, but I just, and also I've worked with him before.
00:36:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He is good at ads. almost hired him a while ago for a client for ads.
00:36:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Like he's, so no, I think the ads are performing because for him to get seven percent conversion on 50 bucks a day on the fact that the funnel doesn't have any conversions on the order and no conversion upsell one. Like to me, there's so much opportunity there and just optimizing the funnel.
00:36:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, if you did one of your calculators and put in two order bumps, like, um, just next level, right? Do you, so you'd have to know what does he have that he could give in between an offer, um, between the seven and the 3500?
00:36:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is there anything that he sells? Yeah, that's my job to figure out because he does have stuff and he gave me access to his whole drive to look at it. I said, look, we just need to create for you like a 297 product or a thousand dollar product.
00:36:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much did that, would you, have to do.
00:37:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, I don't have to create it, but what I'll do is probably will take me only hour to look at all of his existing assets, because he even said, honestly, Maria, Vinny had me create three bonuses for this similar product. And one of these bonuses, I think, could be the $297 if I just flush it out more. Nice. So yeah, it's kind of like what I did with Crena. Like, Crena had that $20 funnel, $50 average order value working with me. I increased to like $105 or more average order value. And instead of sending people to her $4,800 thing, I said, we just need to create a $1000 product. Oh, you're, she already had it. She already had it. So I said, we just need to create a decent enough sales page for it. Here's your VSL script for it. I outsourced the power graphics for it. And we also created the payment plan or 12 for 99, 12 months, and people stay in several months, and she's going to get 15%.
00:37:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So yeah, your most of your work is getting to done in the beginning. One thing I would require is a 90 day contract because you're going to spend most of your time in the beginning and not in that end. And so you kind of get cheated. And that's the thing that I would say is, okay, 5000 a month, this is a target, but it has to be a 90 day. And I would tell him because I'm going to work extra hard in the beginning. And so if you cut me out of because you're going to have to do the research, do the strategy, write the copy, create the ads, do the targeting, manage the ads, tweak the copy and the ads, according to whatever happens, create the nurturing sequence or the ascension or any of any of the follow up sequence. is in order to get people from opt-in to buying and then buying to upsell and so on until they've exhausted all of that. You know you're going to look at his email deliverability because you're not going to want him using email and then you're not touching it. I imagine you would anyway, I can't imagine you're not taking a peek at that and making a suggestion, right? So your mental energy is going there. there's probably going to be some graphics that need to be created in order to support the ad campaign, the landing pages, things like that. And the sequences, now we're talking about automations to an extent. It may be minor and it may be just people consider that part of the job, but it's still your knowledge and expertise.
00:39:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This is a lot that's happening.
00:39:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So technically you're doing like three people's jobs. So well, four. So the media buyer, the copywriter, the graphic designer, and the automation expert, those are for roles that if you have a decent team, you're going to have those four roles are going to be different people, and you're doing all of it. So the other thing that you might build in is say, okay, if I get you to X point, then I get a performance bonus. And I will have earned it.
00:40:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Right. I know my friend Kira, and she's this is how she dealt with student McLaren and another gal that she's now running huge ads for the dinner clients for three years. She started out at 2500 a month plus 10% of ads. And now she's at, I think, 3000 month, the 10% of ads, but she makes 30,000 month for me client. because she grew, she's so good at what she does. Actually, I trained her that, um, you know, she, she got them to be able to profitably scale ads.
00:41:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you need to include that in your pedigree. Yeah, I'm in the notes.
00:41:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
What's her name? Cara. Sure.
00:41:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
She probably wouldn't want she. No, no, you don't have to tell her name. Yeah, I was gonna say her name. No, I don't like telling people's names. I, I'm not going to do that in myself. I'll describe the company because it just feels not good. You know, I don't want people talking about my business. My business is my business and I don't do other people. Um, but, but I want you to tell that story. So Cara, I'm going to put this in a highlight as a task that add that to your thing that you train somebody that does this. Like that's part of your pedigree.
00:41:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, there's a few, Kimmy is the same. She's making a killing and she was my practice for a few years.
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah. but does she do all of these things that you would be doing or does she?
00:41:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, she, she, she, She just does the ads because these people have a team, Stu McClellan has a copywriter, he has a copywriter, but what I could do, I could tell them the graphics design cost is out of scope. I could say I know what I want from the graphic design, but I could say that's out of scope, that the cost of outsourcing graphic design elements. And it's not going to be much, but still, know, it could be 100 to 200, don't you think I figure, right?
00:42:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. It depends on what you need. if you're creating, if you're creating a pretty PDF, that takes a lot more time and energy, even for one of my Filipinos, like I might pay $100 just for that, just for the PDF. But then to get the 3D images and what might be $25. So those parts are not that expensive. But when you, when you are creating a new e-book, the PDF itself targets, it's expensive. So the graphics, not so bad. content that needs to be beautified. That's a little bit more expensive.
00:43:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Beautiful. Yeah, because the book's not really beautified.
00:43:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, but in the presentation matters. Like if I give you a piece of chocolate cake, have I told you this example before? No, tell me.
00:43:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I give you a brand new company, Tina, I'll talk to you girl.
00:43:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I actually learned this in terms about presenting the gospel.
00:43:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
It was funny, but it has universal applications.
00:43:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Presentation matters. So if you see me go cut a slice of a beautiful bakery cake, and I put it on a lovely elegant plate and hand it to you with a fork and a napkin, you know, that's one presentation. Now if I throw it on a paper plate, give it to you with a plastic fork. That's another level, but it feels a little bit different. It feels more elegant when you give it to me with all of that, you know, and it feels special. And but then if you give it to me on a paper plate with a fork, I'm just like, it's delicious, dig in, you know, I'm still here. Now, if you scoop it out with your hand and you put it in my hand, I'm like, I don't think I want it. And if you take tape cake and you throw it on the floor and then you pick it up and give it to me, I'm like, you crazy, go away. Right. it's the same. If you eat it other than the dirty part, it's the same, but how you present it matters. So our content, especially when you're talking about like ADHD, executive dysfunction, and also just depression and anxiety, based on color psychology, we know that colors have energy and they evoke emotion. So if you've just got a plain ugly thing, the emotion, you're not, you're not optimizing the emotion. But if you can create it in colors that create warmth and trust, so like blues and yellows and greens and oranges, that's why. If you look at the biggest brands, almost all of them use blue. Look everywhere. Any kind of thing. There is blue. Google uses it. You go look in your bathroom, go look at the biggest brand names that you buy. There is blue all over them. Because blue is trust. So green is travel, oranges, action, black is luxury, red is luxury also. But anyway, all these kinds of things, yellow is calming, but also trust. blue and yellow are used a lot. Anyway, but then if you like, if you have large chunks of text and it's small text versus the parallax type of design, right, and images. broken up through here so that the eye flows left to right and it's not glorious because or let's say they want to go back to a piece of content and they lost their place for a second and now they got to go through this chunk of text but but that chunk of text they wanted was right next to this particular image and they can find it easy. Most people aren't thinking about this the mental effort that people have to go through to consume their content. Yeah this makes a big impact because how can they be raving fans if they never consumed your stuff. So anyway this is something that again you you can just bring to the mix and you make beautiful images and you do this naturally but most people don't.
00:46:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You know it's true whenever I've hired someone to help with graphic design Tina I'm just like oh you really suck at colors.
00:46:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can do this better.
00:46:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah like like like that's what I'd say to people like Sally lover and she's been a client of mine for for 15 years in customer mind. Cara, by the way, too, she was one of my first testimonials 10, 12 years ago. you know, now she's doing rocking, rocking it. yeah, when they put stuff together, I'm just like, oh, that's like, come on, girl, let's fix this up.
00:47:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You have so much to bring to the table.
00:47:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Sorry. I know, I know I'm excited about that. So, so, yeah, okay. So, so, so I've got a lot in here. This is a lot of stuff in here. Um, do you want to just want to lock it down?
00:47:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am here for whatever and you can tap me down. I get excited about everything. I'm the same way in Sunday school.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So you can just be like, Tino can wait.
00:47:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, should I include the longterm outcome or no, that you said, I do. So, but I break things up and stages. So I'll give the full vision because I want them to see that I can see this and I want to get excited about it. And if I like working with them, I want to stay with them. So I'm going to draw the whole picture out. But I won't scare them with a commitment of, you know, you don't have to we don't have to do all that together. I can start with just this, but I want you to see that this is what I see that we could be working on.
00:48:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so, so how do I quantify or say the full vision? just said, you know, Brooke is there. So yeah, actually I'm like coach certified by her lover. And I think she scaled too fast, though. And I know she's having some issues. But he said that that's I just love her thought model. I love what she does for people, helping them be better you and stuff. And that's what I eventually want to be in. He has, I noticed in some of this stuff in his book that I started reading, he has talked about high performance like himself. This is his first email that sucks, by the way, but this is the book. And you're right, the, the, the, this is not bad top of heart. I got my attention, I saw that. But he definitely is kind of talking about himself as more of a peak performance person, how to approach your business, save my life. I think I save yours too. We talked about how he almost died because he was a mathematics and a dealer. So I've only read the first quarter of it last night and it was interesting. It did hook me. But yeah, I think he could make this better. This is because I think it was on Amazon. think it's kind of like this because it was a written book as well.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, what I would do too and what I want to do with everybody that I work with where I'm any kind of operator is I need to know what the values are but I need to know the overarching value. What is the most important thing? So why does he want to be like Tony Robbins? Does he want to be hero worshiped or does he want to help as many people as he can? Now, he's not going to tell you he wants to be hero worship. Your job is to pay attention then to figure out if he's congruent or not. And here's what you need to understand also if he was a meth addict, he has an addictive personality. Addicted personality means he needs that dopamine hit and he can get that from hero worship. So those are red flags that you have to watch out for is that they need a drug and that can get in the way and that can cause them to sabotage business. So you don't have to fix all that you just need to be aware of it and so but but what you can start with so look at that and you know there's love that he is feeding off the energy that is his drug and it's okay because we all have our stuff but you just you just want to know that you understand why he's all over the but board is because he's chasing dopamine he's chasing his hit. So if you can in managing the business provide the hits. right? Then then he's going to be happy. Whether he can speak it or not, what he needs is to feel feel that that energy coming back to him. So if we could go back to your document?
00:51:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yep. I just lay that down chasing dopamine.
00:51:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:51:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
All right. There it is.
00:51:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. So, um, there is like, what did Tony Robbins do before he became Tony Robbins? then the Tony Robbins we know now is not the Tony Robbins we knew 10 years ago, 20 years ago, whatever. Now he's doing stuff with his wife and leading women. And so one of the things you want to do is put things in perspective as to where he has now, where he was five years ago, where he wants to be. And to know that there is a pace that you can influence.
00:51:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
if you try to force it, you're going to break things.
00:51:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So this is why I talk about sustain up growth. And people that are that have addictive personalities, which I would say that I do, but I've worked on that a long time and didn't very conscious of it. So I didn't make me get a crowding it.
00:52:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Was that me too probably as well?
00:52:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:52:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
that me?
00:52:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
kind of lost my train of thought. But anyway, it was that they'll sabotage things by if they're not filling what they need to do. So you kind of need to help crowd them. And so chunking things out so full vision is just kind of building out what the process is. So we could say, okay, you're here. Here's where you want to be, you know, Tony Robbins level. So one of the things that I would ask him, which is way beyond the scope of support, but it will help you knock this out of the park. If you want to. Um, would be, what is it about Tony Robbins and Brooke that you specifically want to have? Is there anything about them that you're not interested in having in their business? And I would describe, I would have them describe, you know, what does that day look like? does that, that year look like the year in the life of, um, grants?
00:53:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, Tony, do me ask him that messenger right now?
00:53:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not yet. I'll send you these notes so you can go do that later. Um, so then you could say, all right. Well, we know that we can't get there by the end of this year, but maybe we could get there in the end of five years. But in the meantime, you need this to be profitable. And then you want to build out the next offer and the next offer, right? So, we would say the first, you know, six to nine months, our job is to build out, um, is to optimize. This particular offer and do it so well that when you get to creating the next offer that we've got the system down and we can basically replicate it for your next offer. So you're priming him to and that's in a sum to close. We're going to be working together nine months from now. If you want it, right? And that's not manipulation. It's just what I've noticed after the fact. I always operated like that. And then somebody told me, I like your sons of clothes. I'm like, what? What is that? I didn't know. It wasn't a technique. It was just me being me.
00:54:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was just like, well, of course, like, why would I not think about it that way?
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So basically six, nine months build out this offer to profits and do it so well, we'll replicate it for other niches you mentioned productivity relationships. Yes, but immediately after you say that, you're going go now, don't think that I mean it's going to take nine months to profit. I mean that we've matured it to the point that we can now replicate it to the next product. So now you break out the timeline for making this profitable. So me knowing you, I think within the next 30 days, you will have mapped out two order bumps, created the sales pages, landing pages, and ads, whatever necessary for those order bumps.
00:55:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One order bump and then optimize, just because I don't know if go high level has the ability to order bumps.
00:55:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't want to get into technology. Okay. So, yeah, that's a technical language as to how it works, but you know what I mean? think is really what we call it differently. order bump, cell one, there we go, which I always think is not about just dropping the price. Hey, if you didn't like it, that price, here's another one, because that sounds out of integrity. But if you didn't like that, here's a smaller version of it at a lower price. Anyway, so in 30 days, all of that should be mapped out and live. Now, they might balk and think that that's not fast enough. But there's a lot that goes into getting that done correctly. And he's going to have to create more ourselves. So we want to make sure that that happens. 30 to 60 days, then, from day 30 to day 60, is we're observing and potentially, by the way, at the end of 30 days, also having a split test mapped out for headlines or call to action or price, but not all of the above for each of the things that we have going on. So one split test. for every landing page mapped out an on deck for live by the end of 30 days. That's a total agency because everything you're telling me now if I had you five years ago we'd be 50 million a year. I did actually and incredibly fast. It's Arthur Tubman and yeah and and then he ruined it by overselling and pissed me off and I quit and then he got a divorce and yeah and he was also a drug addict. Got it. Recovering. Yeah I do know what I'm doing actually. Yeah I'm scaling agencies but but I also know they're the biggest reason I have most of the guardrails I have is because this is a very difficult model and the clients that you take are make or break because most of them are high pressure and if you get these people who have these arbitrary goals and they're They throw a ton of money at an agency and the agency says yes when they shouldn't have because the client was out of integrity Trying to 10x and it just destroys everybody along the way And yeah, okay, so can we scroll back down when you're when you're ready? Okay, so matter of fact, I have phases mapped out I don't even remember what they are, but I know what I would make and I have all these phases for growing the agency But day 30 to 60 is just monitoring optimization and it's more split testing Split testing the abs again headlines call to action and images Sometimes price point kind of just depends on what's happening but Um The thing about split tests, which I know you know is that you have to have a certain amount of conversions before you can declare a winner, so that requires the amount of volume to be happening. And so people will be like, well, okay, did it win or did it not win? You can't force the declaration of a winning split test until you have volume period, because you want to be confident that you know, and it takes roughly 100 conversions to have some certainty. And that depends on how big the gap is anyway, on the split test. Today 30 to day 60 is optimizing and seeing how it's doing. And it's also getting some customer feedback. And it's filling the holes. So something probably got missed, maybe on an automation level, maybe a pixels not firing, maybe the data is not reporting correctly. But it's fixing anything that got broken during the first phase of 30 days, while we were building something always goes wrong, it needs to be fixed and handled and that takes time.
01:00:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
One thing is that if Karina, that's working really well, mean put this as a post and nothing held back as just value add. The VA, I told her to hire from online jobs.ph, I told her to look at hiring someone with higher IQ because we're service and so this person is not a setter that calls to like, what could call the person was just simply texting and messaging the buyers to, hey, did you get your purchase? I gave you simple process of that, because of that good will or good karma, then those people are more likely to buy other stuff from that map. Then what she also did, because we've been running ads for so long, went back to all the old ads, the actual posts, like within the Facebook ads ID, the actual posts, because she messaged the VA, messaged every single person commenting, hey, just wondering if you're still looking for this did you get value from this did you and then from that that increased like she's making about 10k now a month in sales organically for that for an $800 person and but the reason why we had that asset she's running ads for two years right and so you should put that in 60 in the 60 to 90 days slot so coffee shop millionaire how to click bank penalizes you when you have too high of household and so they got penalized big time and all that I implemented was zendesque and an FAQ section and we dropped it down to less than 2%.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
38 reduction in refunds by having good customer support so yours is actually proactive support rather than reactive right and in that went to there's a saying in sports that the best off best defense is a good offense you don't even need a defense, if your offense is so good that you're always on their side of the field and not on yours, right? So what you did was you had a great offense, right? You're going out so hard that you're actually converting them to the next level of sales. There doesn't even come up an issue of customer support.
01:02:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
This just happens probably in the same conversation. You don't think we can add an FAQ section like in between day 30 to 60?
01:02:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think you should. I think the whole point of creating this scope is not overdoing it. This is a lot of mental work. They, oh, yeah, they zero to 30. Sorry, 30 to 60. You could be starting to do this. Yes. But you, maybe you have the VA do it. So if you do out of scope of support is outsourced VA, then you delegate the VA to start capturing frequently asked questions. As long as you're not doing it, that's okay.
01:03:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, here, start capturing.
01:03:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, 60 to 90, not 0 to 30, or I mean 30 to 60, 30 to 60 is okay, but not before that. I'd probably have that more at 60 to 90 because we don't want to overwork your brain. There's a lot of data to process in 0 to 30 and 30 to 60. Less than 30 to 60, but now 60 to 90, to me, that's optimization, which FAQs and customer support to me is in the optimization realm, but it could be considered fulfillment. So 60 to 90, I mean 30 to 60, it could be in there. It depends on what you want to do and how zealous you feel about it.
01:03:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was thinking it was my funnel. I would want to start maybe in a section.
01:03:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. And I. I like the golden rule methodology of things.
01:04:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
If I were doing it, if it was my business, this is what I would do. How about refine?
01:04:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. So that is an ongoing process. It should always continue to be refined. And also, what I would be doing in that portion is looking at how do we use AI to improve it?
01:04:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Cool.
01:04:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And as far as you going, any services that you offer, knowing what is AI tools and staying on top of that technology to know what can be used to scrape and automate those questions, and because it has the ability to say, somebody asked this question, and this verbiage is different, but it's pretty much the same question. So I'm going to count that as a number. That didn't exist a few years ago, and it does now, so we could create. Additionally, building in here a chatbot for sales and support, 60 to 90 days, or you know now we're getting into phase two of just kind of optimizing and growing scale.
01:05:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Any eye chatbot?
01:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
01:05:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But that's out of scope of the 5000 month, isn't it?
01:05:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, so that could be the next 90 days. And you could say, now this is above and beyond creating and optimization, but this is optimized in scale. first 90 days is create, establish and grow. And second 90 days could be like grow and optimize, optimize, grow, whatever. And then I don't even know you want to put grip, but the third phase is just maintenance and scale. scaling, which seems like they're not the same thing, but when people neglect maintenance and they focus on scaling, then there's problems.
01:06:11 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, so we try to, day zero 30 is phase one, optimize and grow?
01:06:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nope, day, phase one is 90 days. So that's why the whole point of the long term view, like we have six to nine months. Six to nine months allows for the three phases. the first phase is just really creation. The second phase is optimization and the third phase is scaling. And the third phase is the third 90 days.
01:06:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So, day 90 to like next 90 days. Yeah. Phase two.
01:07:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Is it you just call it optimization or scale?
01:07:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Optimizing and preparation for scale. Prepare for So the first thing that you do is look at, you know, maintaining anything from phase one, anything created in phase one. And then now you're going to look for what are...
01:07:44 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Hold on. Let me just hit pause for second. a comment here, but it's one.
01:07:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll hear you.
01:07:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I got about 20 more minutes. But this is for them.
01:08:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what you're we could so many days we'll average I'm excited because I have so much stuff in my brain that I would love to teach and love to get well to use but I won't do it by myself Maria so yeah you're capturing a lot of stuff yeah sorry yeah we can sell this as a consulting kit because everyone wants to start an agency make a current revenue can go high level like this we could totally certified people in this and sell it and we've got the notes from every call okay so phase two is we're maintaining everything that was created in in phase one including the split test process right in the customer support process but most of what phase two is it's continuing to optimize right so understanding our split test results and improving them but the other thing is before we get to scale is where have we left money on the table is there a compliment Mentory or supplementary offer we didn't put out there that we should have that we're getting the feedback from our customers Right so if somebody through the FAQ is in the customer support I said, you know what I have this knowledge this gap this gap in knowledge And it's not being addressed here. How do I get this addressed or? I want more hand-holding. How do I get more hand-holding? or Okay, well you taught me how to do all of these things, but I don't know how to outsource it You're not teaching me how to outsource it. Can you teach me how to outsource? now we create an outsourcing product. So the next 90 days is learning from our customers what we could do better and How do we increase the lifetime value of the customer and but also the average order value? You So, that's it, that's it, that's it, it's just massage everything and make it as good as we can. Phase three is scale and it's, you need to look at the pace of scale and the cost of scale. Is that your mama?
01:10:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Amanda.
01:10:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should just cut back. Okay. Tell me about Amanda. Yes, bye. Yeah. Anyway, so I saw you smiling in the earbuds or so. Anyway. Um, so scale is first, you have to create the strategy for scale. Right. So that's a long discussion. That's not a one off conversation. That's not a one off meeting. That's a whole process. And here's why you doing everything in Trello for them is so important, is because you will have kind of an inventory of what it took to get to where you're doing and what it's taking to manage the current business, right? So you know how many people it takes to fulfill, and hopefully by phase two we've learned how to fulfill well what we're currently fulfilling. So if we were to two X thoughts or three or four X that, what would it take in fulfillment and who's running it and who's leaning it and who's managing it? So how much high-level mental power and energy and leadership is that taking? And can we do that with the existing people? Can we two X with our existing team? Can we four X with our existing team if we can, then we just go through that process. Keeping in mind and making sure that our content. I understand that you can't just go, especially with Facebook and I don't know about other platforms, but especially with Facebook, you can't just go double your ad spend and they double you get a lot of the times that backfires you immediately your ad spend and all of a sudden you're losing the leads that you get it makes zero sense, but I've seen it happen repeatedly.
01:12:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I think this one is more look at other profit sources as well.
01:12:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, but that's really to me that was happening in phase two.
01:12:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Phase two, oh, okay, but no, yeah, I mean, maybe, no, no, no, okay, so phase two, we need to profit sources.
01:12:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was thinking about this right complimentary products that were missing, but you're talking about channels.
01:12:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no hidden money. Yeah, I was thinking about complimentary products, but scale here is like expand other marketing channels.
01:12:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, add channels. Okay, got it.
01:12:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I totally agree with that.
01:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. So how can we replicate our marketing across channels? You know what, if we map this out really well, and then we go get Maui or somebody to make this into a beautiful PDF or slideshows, and then you're presenting this to your clients. Oh my gosh, like a pitch deck. Girl, kind of like just close it.
01:13:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, yeah, like, because, you know, ages ago, when I worked as a strategy, chief strategy person for the, we see what's her name, Emily Hirsch. I actually created for her because she just had a document like that. I said, you know, if you want to close more clients, because I learned that from work for the big consulting firms, we need graphics, right? So we would, I'm just showing you, we would make of these kind of sales projection graphics. See that within sense, they send conversions. And then we would make, let's see.
01:14:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know what I want now. What do you want? I want to work in companies like you with you. All the things that I've been doing. I want you to be the CMO. I want to be the COO. But I just want to have the teams. only want to have one or two meetings a week.
01:14:25 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody do their stuff.
01:14:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I love using my brain.
01:14:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. So I created this on paper and then I hired someone on fiber to put it in digital format. But like, so we could mimic this because it's so beautiful. Mimic this with what you just talked about. Yes. Three phases.
01:14:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, we are magic together.
01:14:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We are. thing is, he's expecting the proposal today, though. So I think I need to give it to him word format, just so he has it because I told him I'd give it to him. And he really wants to know what's out of scope. But I think I have enough from you right now, but I agree.
01:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think eventually we make a pitch deck like this That's what this is right.
01:15:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, this is actually the guy that does the guy her Lee So let's use the guy that on the MacGyver show. He's the writer for MacGyver. That's amazing. This guy.
01:15:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah Here's what I think I know you have to go in a few minutes if you close this guy Yes, then and I'm happy to spend any of our time during the week just helping you Mm-hmm. you don't need help But if we can speed it up so that we can get to some of this stuff together then then again I'm always looking out for me. I'll be honest But what I would love then to do is is take what's happening there because so You know how to go make all the money But what you can see is a light outline the operation and it immediately comes out of my brain like it doesn't take any time Next step, next step, next step, I can go hire the people, I can bring them in, train, insert, whatever. But anyway, if we take all of this stuff in our, in whatever free time is available, and now you've got enough money and you'll be okay, then let's go pitch a client or two max. But they got to be doing 50,000, I would rather see them doing 100,000 a month with roughly 40% profit margins, and they want a COO and a CMO who work together, who will take everything top to bottom and execute it. And we put out killer, like we just put out a few skills that show what we do, and we just wait until somebody takes us up on it, because your money's coming in enough, mine's coming in enough, and we'll wait until the perfect match comes in, and then we get to play together and build this, and then get testimonials from that. So it's a slow pace, but it means we're not For you mean or replicate to other nope, so I call it face so face three and beyond The face three and you're kind of always in face three every product or Like I don't know what you would call it offer every Product offer type Once you get to phase three, is no additional phase. That's it's to infinity because that's scale Unless base four would be selling mean exit the business.
01:18:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
mean yes, God, got Well, did you say before like what was initially face three and Replicate based on it's just scaling and until you can't scale anymore or you want to sell and exit So for for this, that's it For one product market offer type whatever that's this is it It's just continuing
01:19:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
no optimization, sell the offer, sell the business, it both they're there, they can be separate because sometimes, you know, you, you can sell something off piece by piece. So, but then, so what I would do beyond this is go, um, uh, so that's step one of getting towards the Brooke business, right? After phase three, step two, so this is not a phase, but this is, this is a step on the mission, right? Um, um, is launch the next product. And I don't know how that fits into her model, because I don't know anything about her.
01:19:41 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Does she have all these different types of products? Does have now and she has lot of coaches underneath her and stuff, so she has a 25 case certification, but she stopped it all that. I won't go into detail now because I think I'm ready to send this to him because I know he's expecting it. Um, I have to go for massage and
01:20:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like 20 minutes.
01:20:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
terrible. I know, yeah. So, so, but, um, so in scope, I can just keep us assets. creating for you assets.
01:20:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I really like bullets too.
01:20:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think bullets just help the eyes. My problem is that I don't know Google sheets that well, so you want to do bullets to ads?
01:20:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so it's just line breaks and then highlighting it. What do you mean? Let's do this under assets. Yeah, essentially. I was gonna say, if you could share it, I'll just do it for you real quick. But, um, okay.
01:20:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm happy to help. It is. Copy link.
01:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, um, can you do T net profit drivers? That's my main. That's what I'm always in.
01:20:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Either one without profit drivers.
01:20:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'll leave them. Actually, I'll leave them both of them, but, okay.
01:21:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And then I could also put the link in the chat.
01:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's probably fast. Then I'll go do it super quick. Okay. That way it helps with this eyeballs and, um, okay. So where are we at?
01:21:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, right. Then I can see what you're doing too.
01:21:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because I. Should be able to work. Okay. if that doesn't work, here's what we do. We just go up here. There.
01:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, I am. I'm seeing what you're doing. I was just like, screw it. either take it into Canva or hire someone to fix it.
01:21:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. But so that just, and sometimes I will do things like, um, uh, like, I'm not telling you to do this for this one. But anyway, just the little bit of color pop. On things that are really important. Oh, so actually what I would do is do it right here. Oh, shoot.
01:21:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That is not a good color. Sorry.
01:21:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Amazon color. Yeah. It's just, it's. Just a little bit of yeah. Anyway.
01:22:03 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
01:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anything I can do to help energize them immediately and help them focus. And when I'm talking to them, keep them, because everybody's distracted by the phones where you're talking to them, they're looking at all these alerts and notifications or whatever. So if I want them to pay attention to the value I'm bringing and I'm trying to make a sale, or I'm trying to persuade them to say yes and do the thing they need to do, everything I can do to keep their attention focused is for their benefit, but also my clients. I won't drag people. little things to psychologically help them stay focused means that we get there going faster. because I know most entrepreneurs have ADD of some sort or another have focus attention. I'm always trying to be like focus on what I'm having to focus focus. Anyway, I know you got to go.
01:22:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I hope this is helpful. This is really helpful. So, so. the rest of document, though, we didn't finish what's out of scope, though, right?
01:23:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, anything beyond this is out of scope. So, um, like, if you want to write a brand new sales letter, are you doing it? Or are you hiring our copywriter?
01:23:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Um, well, in the existing funnel of specific upsell one, upsell two, yes, that's in scope.
01:23:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. that's the type of thing I'm thinking. So like you already put graphics out there, a VA is out of scope. So for like following up with customers, that's out of scope. Customer support is out of scope.
01:23:40 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Hiring and paying a VA. I want to customer support.
01:23:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. would include help desk, FAQs, et cetera. Chatbot, is that in scope of support or out of scope of support?
01:23:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think I can help strategize to chatbot.
01:24:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But actually creating it, I think that someone else should. So chatbot creation and then in parentheses, I will create the strategy. Somebody else must implement or execute, or that's an additional fee. So like, if you want to do it and manage it, even if you outsource it, you need to be paid for that. Yeah, most contracts are not this detailed.
01:24:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know, yeah.
01:24:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then something you might put in parentheses is to improve the beautifying, improve customer content consumption, and execution. Maybe parentheses at the end of it.
01:24:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, or should I just take that out for now? Just graphic design? Yeah, maybe he's really proud of the playbook when I
01:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's awesome.
01:25:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, that's smart.
01:25:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yeah, I'll end up later.
01:25:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oops.
01:25:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like one idea.
01:25:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anything else on a screen?
01:25:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Well, I mean, um, weekends? Yes.
01:25:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, so like I'm not available via text.
01:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm not available after this hours unless there's a fire. I always put a fire. So the only thing that, um, a fire is orders are broken and they don't work. But I would still say, um, if you want somebody to fix that type of thing, we have a developer on call.
01:25:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm not your developer. Yeah. Oh, the list is a fire.
01:25:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In which case you're only available for consulting, not operating or something, whatever.
01:25:56 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You just say unless there's a fire and then elaborate on a call what that is. Yeah, how about you say weekends? I'm not an electrified balance. So there's fire. That's fine. I think that's, um, I was going to say one more thing that I just thought of. It's important. Oh, cost of the ads.
01:26:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:26:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, it's the actual. That's been spent is in your account. On the credit card. I know that's very detailed, but.
01:26:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I should put my half these pink migraine glasses. I should put them over here because they really do help with I string to.
01:26:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I would scope would be a brand new low ticket offer. How about that? A brand new low ticket. Well, as that would be an additional.
01:26:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I would say anything outside of what is on this document is out of scope of support.
01:27:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay, that's kind of what is on, I would say, what is on this document is out of scope. Oh, sorry.
01:27:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You like what? What is on this document? What is on the scope of this document? Because then it's kind of like redundant.
01:27:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Do you think I'm sorry what is on this document? Okay.
01:27:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I would make these bullets. And highlight the required 90 day contract. And I would use the brighter yellow for that one, bold bullet. Okay. Thank
01:28:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I was going to take out, if you look at the biggest brands, the moans use blue because he uses blue and his branding, but I think we'll just leave it as optimizing the emotions.
01:28:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. going to do this really. What the heck?
01:28:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. I know. don't.
01:28:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. That's what I hate Google Docs for. Did you copy and paste anything into here?
01:28:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No.
01:28:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's weird. It's not that bad. Okay. Cool. Um, out of scope and then we'll do, you know, there we go up on do, okay.
01:28:35 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I say contract, but really it's not really contract to say required 90 day commitment.
01:28:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What about? Yeah. There we go. Out of scope. And I would actually make this like, well, that's harsh. Hold on. That's what I'll do. This is. That's. That's. That's. And that.
01:29:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics Designer, as far as telling them what to do, because graphics designer, I'm saying the outsourcing graphic designer.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Graphics creation. Because you'll direct what graphics are needed to be creative and not create them yourself.
01:29:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Director, how's that?
01:29:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah.
01:29:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Graphics design direction. To increase. I guess I would scope as cost of software is right as well.
01:29:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, for sure.
01:29:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think that sums it up.
01:29:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Awesome. I'm excited for you to have that call. can't wait to hear about it. I'll be like, tell me you got the sale, tell me you got the sale, and you get paid before any other conversations happen paid up front, not after the fact upfront.
01:30:16 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes, yeah, because it's just the stock and the loan gives in the plan.
01:30:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

## Quote 26

> 00:00:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, Mark, we have had three car wrecks in my family in three weeks. My daughter got in another wreck and this time she's born. Yeah, I don't know what the heck is going on. Wait, oh, oops, sorry in chat, plugging my computer. Still, everyone is safe, but yeah, but this is just, it's just wild. And the wreck that she got in, she did the same thing to me, the same thing to a person that this lady did to me. It's slightly different because the lady was coming in from a side road onto But it was a two-way, one-way, two-lane, one-way straight, and the lady that hit me, she crossed a solid light wind without just even checking, like, she just immediately crossed lanes. My daughter, she didn't do that, but I think the kid behind her was speeding anyway. I think she's got an issue with blind spots, and I got to figure out and teach her how to use her mirrors better, because both of the accidents happened, because she didn't see what was there, but she thinks that she was looking, so anyway. Kids are something. There's our Daniel son. Remember we're talking again about goals and just kind of revisiting where you want to go, what we're working on, what we're building towards, so that we more backwards from that was what we were talking about last week. Let's go over just the usual beginning leads everything. Man, valiant surpassing Walker. That was fascinating to me, by the way. I know they had done it by last week, but to be this late in the month, and for them to have 13, it's still not to me an established pattern of we can count on this, but because it's been progressively moving up, I'm finding this quite fascinating and wondering where it can go. Happy Monday. Try to make it happy Monday. Can you hear us, Dan? Hello.
00:02:58 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm here.
00:02:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you not hear me? and now.
00:03:01 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, I'm very vocal, as you can see, all right. I'm my ads, certainly leads.
00:03:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What we're about to say, Mark?
00:03:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's Monday. That's what we're about to say.
00:03:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Should we, should we be having called on Monday?
00:03:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Come on, fellas. Yes. Top of the key.
00:03:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let's go.
00:03:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's my fourth meeting.
00:03:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Top of the key. What do you play point guard?
00:03:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't play basketball at all. I just use I use sports terms as if I know what they mean. You're welcome.
00:03:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, I did. And I was point guard to that.
00:03:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I don't.
00:03:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, focusing on Mark because Mark is the man of the hour. I just I just keep thinking to how crazy it is, how long the list of lead sources are eight months ago. I know that's great because that here's here's that thing. Nobody is killing it in terms of I mean valiant in terms of what it has been before, but if we didn't have all of these different sources this month would look really different. Let's see, Arizona, California, 6, Missouri, 13, New Mexico. That's the other thing. That's been trending up. We've been watching it. I wonder, go and nullitify what the highest month we've had for New Mexico because we're definitely getting there.
00:04:33 - mark sweet (3)
We're showing over 10 a month. We're showing up 10 a month now. Over 10 in New Mexico every month, which I think is pretty solid.
00:04:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, which definitely supports the strategy of expanding into different states is just a powerful lever. The two, the three, I would say. So in the beginning, we didn't even know what the lever is. were really just we just went out leads, which was an educated thing. But gathering the numbers and everything and digging into it. But now I think we're really clearly is, the leverage is states, attorney fees, not attorney fees, but the wages along with optimizing their processes, which were also working on. So I guess it's four, and then intake, which intake was established pretty early on that there's just not one, enough oversight, which is the big game, and two, because there's not enough oversight, enough, not enough management, finessing, whatever which we're working on. By the way, how's the intake script going?
00:05:55 - mark sweet (3)
You guys have a decent copy of it. So we're working off that for right now. want to see would you just have what we've got a moment?
00:06:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, that's kind of what I mean is any observance in how it's working.
00:06:08 - mark sweet (3)
I think it's too soon to be honest with you.
00:06:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK.
00:06:17 - mark sweet (3)
We've had two interviews for other potential intake managers, neither of were particularly great. So I'm going to keep trying to find someone that will come in and guess the next level.
00:06:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK. I'm just typing in the notes. Are you trying to hire anybody else?
00:06:57 - mark sweet (3)
know you always have ads out. In primary assistance, if anything at this point, it's always good to have an extra one or two people come and go.
00:07:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Um.
00:07:20 - mark sweet (3)
We'll just keep our eyes out for anything. Obviously, if we find someone good, we'll find this platform.
00:07:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. And I was messaging you about, um. Uh, Patrick's will email you about what Patrick sent to me. And I just think that. Getting more information. Um, whether we use it on a, on a Monday call, I don't know, you know, much time that you have, but I'd be willing to have a different call at least once a Specifically what I'm, what I'm getting back from the attorneys so that we can dig into that deeply, but that's. not really something you need to bug Dan with. And we already have a lot that we go over on Monday calls.
00:08:08 - mark sweet (3)
So do you have one in on is how we can make Dan make a valley.
00:08:14 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Because we're working on it.
00:08:16 - mark sweet (3)
Double that that'd be super cool. And then Walker I wouldn't need anywhere as much. And I'm going to know it's just a weird month for Monkey. And obviously when this month ends give is what we sign this month.
00:08:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You totally dodged my question though.
00:08:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Sorry.
00:08:36 - mark sweet (3)
Can you afterwards is a short answer? Yes we want some of that to what it's generally speaking.
00:08:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Then I will plan for that because I and that will be a super freaking long day. But okay.
00:08:48 - mark sweet (3)
A different day if you want. Thursdays are usually okay as well.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay that would actually work. So let me just send that not to myself because I don't I don't think I'll forget but. Thank you because I think that that would really be helpful. mean, I don't think we're wasting time, but I want to make the most amount of time. And there's so much more to wrap my head around. So I want to, I'll get there faster with a little bit more help from you. And that's what I was hoping for.
00:09:19 - mark sweet (3)
So thank you. Do you have a question with Dan while we're on here? So in lead flow, we got one this morning at like 10 30, that like absurdly send a new lead for Jose. But I have no idea where that lead is or what that lead is or anything else. Can you help me out a little bit on that or that's just like where it is where in lead flow? So I see lead flow in, it was a, you know, new record quest lead. I don't see an email and I don't necessarily see it in Lidify anymore. So my question is, where is that lead?
00:10:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
You don't see it in Lee Flowey at all, you're at all?
00:10:03 - mark sweet (3)
Lee Flowey just says new rep request lead, and I see it David Williams. That's after I click to look at it a little more. Yeah.
00:10:40 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that tag in Lee Flowey is to put him into that automation, then we don't do anything with them in Lee Flowey. We're just sending them to Jose for now. And then if he wants us to build automations and stuff, we're going to where I told him, I said, man, we can do all kinds of stuff. We're just going to start with sending you these people.
00:11:04 - mark sweet (3)
But he's a little funny gathering any information other than they're looking for new representation, because it's the only thing that came over. And usually they get like some basics of how the motion happened.
00:11:18 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah, usually, well, we've never gotten one of these. So, look at their sheep. Just because a little kick off and we're going to like, when it's working stuff. Yeah, they took out the leaves from. Oh, let me ask Eric.
00:11:50 - mark sweet (3)
They definitely think we'll pick up a few with this.
00:11:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah. I just asked Eric, it probably doesn't, he probably just isn't populating it, or it doesn't, and then we'll just have in any modify which you're sending us.
00:12:28 - mark sweet (3)
Where did it wouldn't?
00:12:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm almost positive it does, because this is one of the questions on their form, so every lead we get from them right now is them saying, no, I don't have an attorney. Right. So this is the right. So it's it's got to be, but I just don't know. These are different, right? So we set up a different totally different webhooks. So it's a totally different zap and all that stuff.
00:12:53 - mark sweet (3)
Got it.
00:12:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, totally for that. Oh, Eric is just saying it's. Yeah, no, it's not populating. He said it does, but it's not populating, so I don't really want to fix it.
00:13:09 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:13:11 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
All right, yeah, done.
00:13:14 - mark sweet (3)
Cool.
00:13:15 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Or soon to be done.
00:13:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
About the valiant stuff. I'm just curious, because I can't, I don't need to be able to wrap my mind around it. So you can just tell me, don't worry about it. But how much do you think you understand about his process, like, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out, like, what are the odds that you think that we could get those kind of results at some point and be able to apply that to other states?
00:13:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Just look at the spread of what's happening across states and then look at the population that's what you're about.
00:13:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You, you doing it though.
00:14:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I know what keywords is running, I don't know that you'll get any more or less by having essentially a competitor going for the same keywords, but if you look at, if you look at his results, you can say, like, I don't know if he is running in California, But if he's not, the question I have, which we're never going to know the answer to because he's not going to let me in his ad account, is he running the ads correctly, right? Could he be running them better? I don't know. But I know what keywords he's running. So I have an average chicken DJ or like fixing the site because I've used the site in like a year. So I sent that, I asked them to fix it and they're fixing it and then I can go run ads through the site that I have. But it's... What he is doing specifically is not scalable, right? It's like, I mean, that sort of stab words in general, right? if the keyword you're working with is, is finite, right? So, and this is just a very finite keyword. So it's not like he's probably not missing out on a lot of clicks, I suppose it could be. But once I start running those same keywords and then seeing what is the real impressions, right? So I can see what he's doing, but I don't trust the numbers that I'm seeing. But we could take, well, don't know if I can do this, I should see if I can do this. Since I know where the leads are, I wonder if I can get the search impression data for, I don't think I can.
00:15:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Can you go to similar web and get data on that? On what he's doing? No.
00:15:51 - mark sweet (3)
You didn't ask him for the search impression data.
00:15:54 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I mean, you're paying. I mean, I'll just get it. It doesn't, I'll just get it by running out. I mean, that's the ultimate. Because then there's also the idea that if he's not running the ads directly, then the impressions are actually wrong, right? then we also know that his other data is wrong, right? He has these crazy numbers. like, bro, no, that's not right. But so if I just go running the same state to him, the first thing is, does it get more leads, period? And then you can dig into, well, what's happening as far as impressions and yadda yadda yadda. But the four keywords that he's running are very, very low volume, unless you go to a bigger state, Texas, California, New York, Florida, right, then it's going to be, it's going to be driven by a population.
00:16:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So then you can't be actively working on a
00:17:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
right now because we're waiting for the website. Is that right? Yeah, the site's up.
00:17:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do we have an ETA on that?
00:17:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I do not. sent it to states.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And when the site is up, then how long would it take for you to just get started and start running ads? it would probably take a few more weeks for new data.
00:17:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No, it would take like an hour to run ads and then data will start coming in two hours later. And then you can extrapolate out after, know, a couple of days, you can extrapolate out like this less than a week, right? You'd say, this is the impressions per day, right? It's not like Facebook, right? It's like they're either happening or they're not. People are searching it or not. it's not going to vary too much. This keyword is not going to be like, oh, it's super hot on Mondays. If you don't need three Mondays, I mean, if you want really believable data, you would say, hey, and I always say this, it's like you need three Mondays because Mondays are always the highest traffic day, no matter what. But you'd have some idea of the general volume at a state level, right? So there will be running in separate states. You'd have a general idea of what the impression volume is or is going to be.
00:18:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What website is this that they're that you're anyone?
00:18:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Car accidents, settlement quote.
00:18:42 - mark sweet (3)
What's the chances? Cannibalizes to some level what Devon's doing.
00:18:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Cannibalizes as in reduces the overall volume of leads?
00:18:53 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:18:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I would say unlikely. More likely. would be duplicate leads, and then extra leads, right, where, or you'd get the same volume of leads, but then split across two sources. So you're going to get, it would probably be like duplicate, then same volume, but split, and then the third outcome is you get more leads because, let's say, right, we'll also get like the click-through rate, right? So a basic click-through rate right, like if I get a 20% click-through rate, well, he could be getting a 20% click-through rate, but I can start to kind of guess what his is doing based on what we see as far as the leads go, right, if they stay the same, and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then he probably is. If I, if we get more leads and I'm getting a 20% click-through rate, then maybe he's not in.
00:20:01 - mark sweet (3)
It won't do that.
00:20:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
That's a myth. Right? the idea that the auction or whatever, it's like, the way that I run ads, I don't spend money to get the clicks. I try to get a better ad placement based on the ad, the website, right, using sort of the triad is relevance of keyword to add to landing page. Right? So if you get, he definitely doesn't have that because he's like sending all of them to the homepage in pretty sure. So it's not going to drive up his, I'm not going to just like get all the leads. I'm just going to run the keywords and try to get leads and ideally get leads for as little as possible. We also know what his cost per lead is, right? So I can then all, I can maybe sort of figure out other stuff, like fill in the blanks by, they're no longer blanks. because I'm filling it in saying, well, it's likely this, or this is the number that I'm seeing. So then this is probably what's happening. Or, you know, I get a lead and then this is my hospital, then you have a direct one-to-one comparison.
00:21:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, okay. Well, and even if it did happen, the way that it would happen would be the only leads to Dan God are the same leads that he got. But if that's the case, one Dan figured it out, so he just stops running in the same place that he's running and puts it somewhere else. And we stop that bleeding and duplication. But it would still be basically in that sense, instead of thinking it as paying for duplicate leads, you would think of it as paying for validation that this is the strategy that works. now, we know it and there's no longer a veil because you've got the inside person working for you that you can then go apply to all the other states.
00:22:06 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, because yeah, I mean, look, the more we get away from the vendors that are off, going to be and you see having 10 vendors is left right and having to do.
00:22:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure. I think somebody might have brought that up several times when they said, go look for more vendors and make that a regular habit.
00:22:25 - mark sweet (3)
No, it's a very, it's a very twenty twenty four thought.
00:22:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I could stop both of you.
00:22:36 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It was one of the first things I said when I looked at his needs, I was like, oh, you're getting 70% of your leads of this one vendor alert alert alert alert. And now they're and now they're in the crapper. So it all worked out.
00:22:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And now it's, I mean, it's pretty much the end of the month, but 81 incidents, people's not bad.
00:23:00 - mark sweet (3)
Okay, so Well, three more days. We'll probably. High 80s, maybe 90 lucky.
00:23:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Nice. Do we want to talk about we did all any more before we get into. Just some gold stuff that I was talking about.
00:23:20 - mark sweet (3)
Um, so he's hot to hop. And see what the hell. Blue Bay coming up.
00:23:26 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are they over?
00:23:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No. Who is that?
00:23:30 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, I thought they were ending like, oh, it's next month.
00:23:33 - mark sweet (3)
Next month. Soon, but not for you.
00:23:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is he the? know I've heard that name before, but I don't know who it really is.
00:23:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Link. They're a link vendor. They're SEO company, but they're just doing link building. God only knows what they're doing actually.
00:23:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you need to talk to them about what.
00:23:56 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
What they're doing money. Okay.
00:24:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
with his money. Okay, got it. All right, anything else?
00:24:10 - mark sweet (3)
We moved America a little bit to have her do more stuff with reaching out with the doctors.
00:24:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, good.
00:24:17 - mark sweet (3)
Try and get that up. So we're just kind of seeing all the doctors that we work with, finding out their t-shirt sizes and everything else, setting out swag boxes to each of them. It's been a little bit. Then she's following up and ordering lunch every time we pay in full, but that bill's starting to get a little bit high. That's okay. It's it's generating cases. So that's fine. So we're moving in that direction, which we should continue to then start seeing the doctor referrals go back up a little bit more. So I'd really like that to be 10 15 a month. Yeah, especially given that we're paying these doctors in full and everything else. Missouri, we will start getting referrals. Again, that was kind of the promise if you Well, for us going into that state and so we sent 11 people, I know it's only like since it needs to be, there was 11 people in total that were sent out to doctors. So I'd like Dr. Bell to know how many of us teach doctors, client names obviously, so you can start nudging on them to train and also to start sending us back the cases. So sorry to start going that direction, so that's what we're doing in our part. I need them to do their part.
00:25:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And since you already have all this stuff in Letify, are there reports where you can track that? Because we talked about it last week, but it wasn't super clear like how to easily look at number one, who you're, and we did see it. Oh, there's a honeymoon, sorry. I'm focusing on, I'm sorry. When was in Arizona, I was sitting outside in a hummingbird. just came and there were no flowers or anything around me and it just flew right in front of me and just stayed there for about 30 seconds just looking at me. was the weirdest thing in school. Anyway, okay, doctors, like what are the most ranked by how many cases they sent you and vice versa, how many cases you sent the doctors and what that reciprocity looks like with them. Because then we can also dig further in and kind of profile what does that look like? Is there a personality that sends you more stuff? Is there is it location and volume of their business? Is it what you know about how many other lawyers they're working with? There's a lot that we could dig into to profile the process of what makes a doctor referral relationship and kind of massage that. mean, there's the general Oh, things that we know about psychology is if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, AKA swag boxes, painful lunch, things like that. But there's going to be more to it. Like when you connect with somebody, well, they're going to be more inclined to want to send you stuff, just be like, marks my guy kind of thing. You have stuff like that. Can you say that that works out well for you? Is it the quality of the connections that you have versus the quality of their business or the volume of their business or the quality of what you give them has some kind of monetary value. Since that is such a big lever in your business, like we together here haven't really dug into that, but I know that you think about it, but I don't know that you think about it to that extent. that is definitely especially with your personality that. That may or may not, you know, make an impact because maybe there's hands tied. don't know. But anyway, I think that that's something we could spend a little bit more time and dig into more and figure out if there's a way to make that even more effective, less with the volume, more with the quality of the relationships, strategically with doctors who have higher volume. Or offices that have higher volume with a doctor in an office that has higher volume, who might just nudge his coworkers and be like, this is the guy, you know, we'll get paid full amount. Our people will get taken care of quickly. His people are going to make sure that they're taken care of and that, you know, they're actually cared for. They're going to follow up with them quickly. That type of thing, what are the doctors that you work with that care about their clients and their experience, know, from the beginning to the end, as well as the money, but either almost equally with the money they care about the clients or you know something like that. Yeah, I said a lot, but what do you think?
00:29:12 - mark sweet (3)
it's not, um, there's no straightforward answer to a lot of this. There's a lot of firms that look for like one to one or I said you two I get one back and we're not anywhere near those levels. So I know we've got more room to work on these things. know, I understand the doctors have other mouths to feed as well. So we've got to be aware of that, of course, but it comes down to, like you said, the relationship and also just being top of mind that's more than anything else.
00:29:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you know how some days you'll just be thinking about something. Usually it's like the middle of the night and then you come back to us the next day with this full report of you were thinking about something and you dug into it. I love it if it would be this one. If you you just happen to think and maybe subconscious being what it is, you'll think about this and think about maybe somebody that might stand out to you and you can go get the data to verify it, that gives you maybe their higher value cases, more amount of cases. But if this is something you ever just think about wanting to dig into yourself and start kind of profiling the doctors so that we can get a little bit of traction into what we can do to improve it, that would be great. Because there's just no way you don't uncover something of, oh, this is a little bit, this tends to be a little bit more value for us. Like it can't just be random in what we get from the people that we're working with. That wouldn't make sense to me. It could be wrong, but. That's either of you have to be okay, potentially cutting off some of these doctors and sending somewhere else For sure, but it all starts with what is your awareness of them in the first place? Your cases was that less and less is less involved with the cases Yeah, so that's the other thing and something that I was thinking about is how kind of hands-off you are Which leads us back to the conversation of what kind of business are you trying to build now?
00:31:34 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And the goal setting so let's talk about that then for the rest of the let's talk about something else now sorry So this is hilarious So this morning so I updated that certainly that leads on Friday and we're sort of working on making this a little easier and I'm trying to get Isaac to help them too, but I've seen this before and all this time I know that the step waiting for docs exists but I had never seen a record collective as that so I told for them I told I use one of their updates right and in my head I'm like oh waiting for docs must mean that they're waiting for the insurance to be real like what is waiting for docs they can be a couple of things either we're waiting for like proper damage photos to see if it's case you want to take um we're waiting for insurance information police report or if we're trying to sub in we may be asking for like the previous file so we're waiting for some sort of document before we can move forward and decide whether we're going to take it or not okay so I said to this dude uh hey they're waiting for docs um I think it's the insurance thing and he's like hey yeah he's like this is what other firms are doing like if they if it's that close they're just signing the them and then they're dropping them after. And I was like, I don't know if Mark will do that. Dude, two for two. Well, both of these firms, both of these side with someone else, I'm like, one of the odds, I guess they're pretty coming. But now there's lot of firms that are these good cases.
00:33:18 - mark sweet (3)
We don't know. More often than not, they're not. But every now and then there's a diamond in the row. Oh, that's painful. And so that's why they sign them all because, you know, the one out of a hundred that turns into something good.
00:33:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has anybody ever done the math on that diamond in the rough and whether or not that's even reversible?
00:33:37 - mark sweet (3)
There's no way to really know because we don't sign the case, we have no idea how it really ends.
00:33:44 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, let me answer this. It's, it seems like you, like you guys, again, I've never seen it. I have all the leads. I've looked at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I've never seen someone mark that. I just knew it existed.
00:33:59 - mark sweet (3)
So.
00:34:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
It's is your use of that is that I mean is that an internal signal that you're like this has got to be pretty close because We didn't turn them down. So like it's not sign everybody. It's like this is borderline Like maybe we should sign these ones because we're we're so close Maybe we should sign those a drop them not just sign them when they comes in the door What's it there's 12 in the waiting for doc status right now? Yep, that's it. We should look at it.
00:34:33 - mark sweet (3)
Look at this So like I'm looking at one. It's really first. It's a dog bite We're waiting to find out about home insurance because just taking a drop me just it's a waste of everyone's time Well, mean it's dog bite. Yeah Um, why would you even take a case like that? Well Yeah, okay, and they say they know who the homeowner isn't everything else Okay, then give us that information, but like, if you don't, then it's kind of hard. John Cuevas, this one's relatively new. waiting for PD photos because he doesn't know why she was parked. And then he said he was struck on the rear bumper, but it's a drivable car. So I don't know if there's a case here or not without seeing the photos.
00:35:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. So it's almost like there's got to be, so the question then is, are there ones that you're like, oh, is so like, if they turn this one thing in, this is for sure a good case.
00:35:36 - mark sweet (3)
Like that one kind of on its face, you're like, this is going to, this is going to fly, but yeah, we'll see what it take way more risk when it's like a larger injury case, right? But when it's like this, with the tissue case, I don't want to take a case or sending it to a doctor and then we find out the property damage is garbage. And then you've done all that. I dropped it. The doctor's pissed off. This the one Michael Ester, he says he has full coverage. Okay, I want to see that you have because the other car doesn't have any insurance. I don't want to sign up. just the drop in.
00:36:09 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So they don't have access to their insurance cards. Like, well, I guess that makes sense.
00:36:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you been like 12 years since I have, but have you ever read a book called E-Mits? No, or a classic book called Built to Sell.
00:36:30 - mark sweet (3)
You got me rebuilt to sell.
00:36:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, in correlation with E-Mits, which actually is updated, called E-Mits Revisited. It's very different. Built to sell by itself. Not so much, but it gets into the nitty gritty of what E-Mits lays down in broader framework. But I would like you to read it, the latest version. And basically, this is going to sound oversimplified, and you may want to push back on it, but I'd like you that suspends your doubts for bit. But the premise is, there's a few things. mean, they talk about org charts, I think, in there and the maturity of companies and how they get there is by strategy, planning, and specificity. And one of the topics, the thing that made me think about it, is what are your menu items, basically? Like, you can't go to McDonald's in order of filet mignon because even if somebody let you do it and they went to the store and they got a filet mignon on the chart to prepare it, first of all, it's inefficient. Second of all, they're not going to be good at it. Third, you're not going to want to come back. Fourth, the repetition of whatever you create and provide increases your efficacy at creating and providing that thing. So there's a potential that, I brought it up before and you said that that's not practical, but we don't have the data that says that. and there have been a few times where something you said was one particular way and then we dug into the numbers and lo and behold, it contradicted what you originally thought, that there may actually be a system and a strategy to the most leverageable cases rather than a catch-all of we need to take all the business because that's the only way we can catch the big winners and the big winners are what save us at the end of the day, whereas optimization may actually be the thing that not only saves you but puts you where you want to be at the end of the day, which is the most likely thing by the way. So I would like you to read that book and just see if you have any thoughts and really, really, really try to suspend any negative thoughts about why it can't work because you could be right and that's okay and those thoughts will happily come back in as soon as you let the door back in. What we need is what are the new thoughts that we haven't had, what is the new understanding that is equating us, keeping us from getting to that thing that you're trying to get to, that for sure, that's how growth happens. We learn the new thing, we do the new thing, and then we finally get to that. But if you want to be something different, you have to do something different, that kind of premise. So anyway, and it may give you some thought as to what you do want to build, which is still the conversation I would like to have. But now that we've got 20 minutes left, so Dan, don't throw a rinse in it.
00:39:31 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
I'm just trying to optimize things.
00:39:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, okay. Anyway, would you please read that book?
00:39:41 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, ma'am.
00:39:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Thank you. Okay, now, and this is the ongoing conversation that I'm going to say that we should at least touch on it every six months, because at the very least once a year, but it really should be more like every six months, it just kind of recalibrate. what we're working on, but you've gone through a lot on a personal level in terms of growth, especially this last year, that at the you being the visionary who you are as a person, most definitely impacts the vision that you personally have and your business is going to follow that. So have you thought about lately in depth what your life looks like three years from now, five years from now? And I would love it if you would be as detailed about that as possible, whatever you're willing to share, not just on a professional level, but what does your day-to-day life look like? How are you feeling? Who are you with? What are you doing personally and professionally?
00:41:00 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
point.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, the perfect day exercise, but it's not a but it's not the perfect day. It's more like the average week and the overall thing because I don't days are too different. They vary. And there are seasons, for example, you know, in the summer, my summer days are very much different than my fall days than my winter days and my spring days because of kids but also because of the weather. Like, so, you know, people take vacations specifically during certain types of seasons and it's not the same for all people, holidays, family trips, things like that. So I don't do the perfect day exercise, but there are certain elements that exist in your average day, like how much time that you're working, what kind of people you have in it, how you feel, are you doing social activities. is are you exercising? How much is your business working or making? What states are you operating? And how many more people do you have? Are you selling it? Are you not selling it? Are you are you working towards fatherhood? Are you working towards spending more time traveling? Like all these different things have a huge impact on the amount of time and energy that we devote to the business the quality of time and energy that we devote to the business and how much the business can give or take from all the other things that we're doing. So if we're not looking at the person as well as the business then we're setting ourselves up for some kind of failure because if they're not engineered to be complementary to each other one will take from the other. Yes. So what have you been thinking about?
00:43:00 - mark sweet (3)
probably just don't know what I want in that regard.
00:43:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In what regard?
00:43:04 - mark sweet (3)
Like what I like, do you like your side, I I literally don't know. I enjoy what I do on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, there's two days and bad days, of course, as anything, but you know, I'm excited on where we're going, but are we going to be in 15 states, right, in three or five years? I don't think so, but I didn't get really in a day-to-day.
00:43:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What is your purpose in life?
00:43:37 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, that's a good question.
00:43:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How much more time are you willing to spend with me?
00:43:49 - mark sweet (3)
Uh-oh, 16 minutes. Oh, bah, bah, bah. I don't mean today.
00:43:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I mean, general, do you want to have... specificity in your goals and what you want out of life or do you want to keep meandering? How's that working out for you? And I said, you need to start practice. That is not a judgmental start. Like that might sound like it. I get what you're saying.
00:44:15 - mark sweet (3)
Like so far, it's honestly, it's a new challenge and generally speaking, I I think I understand where goals are, you know, obviously it's around profitable company to expand within reason and to have some balance. But, you know, as we've talked about before, I like working like my dream goal is not to sit on the beach and sit martinis like that's not my dream goal.
00:44:45 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So you can't say what it is, though. You could say what it's not, which is good.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's almost always the start is what it's not.
00:44:55 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah. So what are the things working on vacations for you? two weeks, you know, this place doesn't fall apart. It's fine. So I can go and take time and do whatever I want to do. you go and, you know, travel and have fun if I want it. Or, you know, as involved as I want to do, not handling day to day cases really anymore. So that obviously takes off the gigantic stress and, you know, being tied to the desk.
00:45:22 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Are you done with that other coach?
00:45:24 - mark sweet (3)
Dude, what happened with that guy? I got two more sessions.
00:45:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Got you. That's the therapist one? Yeah. Yeah.
00:45:34 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:45:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But it's helpful. Yes. Yeah. So. You know, One of those things.
00:45:42 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
things. Is kind of thing tripling your business?
00:45:45 - mark sweet (3)
Um, we'll see. I mean, definitely making better connections with people. So that's good. I cannot tell you how many random people just fall off inside, like, seem happy, which is.
00:45:57 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yes. Oh, God, you must be, must be jarring for you.
00:46:00 - mark sweet (3)
Um, you'll know like we're at like a restaurant this the chef like walk by he's like, I just want to let you know like you seem, you know, like a really happy person.
00:46:08 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
She's like, what? Really?
00:46:10 - mark sweet (3)
Someone I've never met before.
00:46:12 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Super weird. Mark, are you glowing?
00:46:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is there a glow? Well, I haven't called you here for a long time and I've talked about your energy being much better.
00:46:24 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, no. And, you know, some of the stuff makes a lot of sense, um, where people come with negative emotion, however you want to take that, you know, it's them coming from a place of fear. so understanding where that fear lies that are helps you figure out what the main issue is for lack of better term, which is about things that did dig into it.
00:46:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, and there's only so much conversation that you can cover in one hour a week anyway. So just being able to spend more time on a personal stuff is going to be helpful.
00:46:54 - mark sweet (3)
So. no, it's, it's really good. Um, you know, I can live that making sure you're not gossiping. But other people yourself, you really are.
00:47:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
We've had that conversation. Remember the issues that you and Mary used to have in the whole office used to have, and part of that was talking about people behind their back. Yep. Yep.
00:47:14 - mark sweet (3)
That's the cancer.
00:47:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
No drama role.
00:47:17 - mark sweet (3)
Big fab. No drama llamas.
00:47:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, yeah.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait. Why? got to be a mama's.
00:47:24 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Lama llama llama llama. No rhymes with mama. It's a book.
00:47:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I see. I see how it is up in here. Okay.
00:47:37 - mark sweet (3)
That's just been good.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So we're going to go. So one of the goals is you're not retired.
00:47:45 - mark sweet (3)
Time to take on less is the other thing which I'm sure you would definitely enjoy.
00:47:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, yes, but the thing that I am concerned about and kind of increasingly so because you have two goals that are at odds with each other is. Basically. not showing up to work, but then you want to grow the business and who's there to manage it and grow it. When Mary's not in the office, you're not in the office and that math doesn't add up to me. So that's part of this questioning too. There's only so much optimization you can do without present leadership.
00:48:24 - mark sweet (3)
Of course. Well, Mary will be back in August.
00:48:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
In the office?
00:48:30 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah.
00:48:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How does she feel? you still refer to her as your right hand? Does she feel like you've empowered her to be that now?
00:48:45 - mark sweet (3)
I would hope so at this point, you know, give her a lot of deference and looper and all, you know, everything that's related to what she does.
00:48:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Will you ask her? Yes, okay. Will you remember to ask her or do I need to say?
00:49:06 - mark sweet (3)
can ask her right now.
00:49:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you want. Yeah.
00:49:09 - mark sweet (3)
Okay. You want me to do. still feel like you're right hand person?
00:49:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Or what do you want to ask specifically? So.
00:49:16 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Right. Right.
00:49:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
At one point we had a conversation and. You said I always referred to you as your right hand, but you felt like I didn't. Treat you like that and that I undermined you. How would you describe that now? Open ended please like that. How would you describe it now?
00:49:42 - mark sweet (3)
Okay.
00:49:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, so that's good. Um, but, but this would be the thing. There's so much to it and that that's the other part like lately we spent about half an hour on. And, um, at the very least on lead to things like that, which is an important part of it, but, but for the things that I do, managing overall company structure, business growth, things like that, working with you as the CEO, like a dance time, we spend probably half of it, just talking about, well, it depends on what it is, what week it is, whatever. Yeah, yeah, um, but, but I'm able to go there, depending on whatever happens, and this, this three way version we have is the hybrid, and there's a lot of stuff I want to get to that there's, there's not enough time to get to. And especially where we're at right now, having systems for, we've got some good clear data. Anyway, I just feel like there's not enough time to really dig into some of the things that will work. will make the biggest difference like this and it really stretches out the runway for what kind of growth can happen. But I think that more is possible because you're primed for it now. You know the need for the numbers. We have a system for the numbers. There's more knowledge about your team. We've improved the processes. But I just don't think there's enough time really to dig into it and put a really solid framework on what's happening and there's constantly, you know, in the office, very having babies is what it is. You can't change that, right? But I really am concerned about the goal of wanting to grow and optimize the business and not having a physical presence in it and no one who is really looking at optimizing the business being in there doing it either. The reality is that It just doesn't seem like those goals are very compatible and I want to, we don't really talk about that, so I think that that's something that needs to be addressed. Now, if you're like, let's just have the best business that we can have while I'm not in the office a lot and just make this work as best as it can, then that's a goal. And it's something that that we're doing, but it doesn't feel like that's really what the goal is.
00:52:36 - mark sweet (3)
It's still to give a large f**k you to everyone else, so yeah.
00:52:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so that that's a very specific thing. Yeah. What does that look like?
00:52:48 - mark sweet (3)
Large middle fingers. Like the New Mexico thing. I don't know if I told you. We got something done by case in New Mexico and the lawyer decided to file a lawsuit against Sam and me. bar firm, which is weird. I'm not mad at her for like it's not like she does something wrong. just an lawyer in another state. Right. So we had to like deal with it and whatever and she's freaking out a little bit which is good showing like, hey, know, there's other things out here like don't take everything seriously.
00:53:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so when you're talking about flipping everybody off and saying whatever does that mean not being a lawyer anymore selling a business?
00:53:26 - mark sweet (3)
No, no, no, no. So sorry where I'm going with that is he's an lawyer, but now I'm at the point where I have money where I'm literally buying a mobile billboard just to go around his office for the next three months. I found the 14 billboards he passes from his house to his office, which we're picking up just to put our name on it so you can see that every single day.
00:53:50 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Okay, I'm on the go board.
00:53:53 - mark sweet (3)
It's gonna be the same space with our law firm. Oh, nice. Every single day.
00:53:59 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Well, that's funny.
00:54:01 - mark sweet (3)
So now we're in a spot where I can do that. So, you know, we're going to drop 20 or 25 grand on that, and I'm okay with it. It should also help generate business, which is great. So it's, you know, good purpose and, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm talking about to get to a level of you, or I can drop 25 grand on some that may not produce anything just to prove a form.
00:54:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. How long do you want to have your law firm?
00:54:31 - mark sweet (3)
I have no idea. Zero idea? I have zero idea.
00:54:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
If I got...
00:54:38 - mark sweet (3)
Because he doesn't know the other thing. I know. You're going to use an offer tomorrow. would sell it, but like you would have to be an amazing offer. It's not like I'm running the sell it or running the, you know, head it off to someone either.
00:54:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. Well, I'm going to plant this idea at your head, whether it be with me or the other guy you're working with, or whatever else, I highly recommend you try to work on figuring out what is your purpose. was for living this life. I'm happy to help you with that. You asked, that's not, that's not that the seeing people hired me for. It is definitely something that's come as a result of working with me. And that's something we can get clarity. that might be something that the guy that you're working with can help you with too. It doesn't matter. But you have to be willing to think about things and you have to be honest about it. you also have to know that that is an evolutionary conversation. Generally what you think the first time that you have that conversation, it doesn't end up being that. What you find is that it is a almost like a run on a ladder where you started the bottom and you kind of end up when you get more clarity. imagine the perspective from the ladder. So imagine that ladder is like 6,000 feet tall and you start somewhere towards the bottom, but the higher you go, the more you realize in terms of the expansive life and your impact, your experiences, things like that. And then because your perspective has changed, your information that you have to process those thoughts has changed. now more have information. If that was, let's say you're a cartographer and you're starting out at 1,000 feet versus 6,000 feet, and imagine that there's no limitation to your eyesight that you can now see whatever's available to you at 6,000 feet, your ability to map that area is going to increase because you can see it, aka more information, more data about what's around you and where you exist inside of that. So it has to start somewhere, you know, like when people ask you what do you want to be when you grow up? Almost everybody is not what they thought they were going to be for different reasons sometimes because of opportunity, sometimes just because they evolved and there's that perspective change, right? They didn't know that they had particular gifts. They didn't know that there was a dark side to the thing that they wanted to do. And once they experienced that, they're like, oh, that's definitely not for me. But then they realized that the positive aspect of it was what really drew them and that that positive aspect exists in something else that doesn't have the negative one as well. So anyway, but when you start to get closer to what life is for you and why you're here and why you want to stay here as in living why life matters to you, everything else falls a little bit more into place because the boundary lines almost kind of draw them. I want this, I don't want this, I want this, but it's incompatible with what I've said I am or who I've said I am or what I'm here to do. So then I have to ask myself again, do I really want this or do I want that? And so there it kind of installs a filter that or sift, if you will, impsive to run things for and it just creates this refinement. Which is another word for, it's not another word for, but it's likening to optimization, optimization in your business is refinement. Refinement in your person, optimization, so they're very similar. But you again, being the head of all the things, without that compass, which really is what purpose gives you, you know, the Cheshire Cat says. else's which way do I go goes well where are you trying to get to and she goes I don't know then it doesn't matter what path you take right? So anyway think about that and I would recommend that you work on it one way or another and then we can kind of revisit the conversation but I still have more questions so we can just pick it up whenever we're done with the marketing stuff next week and and work towards it uh because even without figuring out the purpose part there's still more that we can dial into them anyway we've had 15 minutes so I'm working from before I forget remember this week Caroline idea we had yeah yes yes yeah no it's not good news um it would be incredibly expensive to license the song to change the lyrics it is not incredibly hard to just use the song itself but the song and change the lyrics is
01:00:00 - mark sweet (3)
It's very expensive and very, very difficult.
01:00:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So would it be considered changing the lyrics if you speak the words kind of in cadence or they show up on a screen like if it was a TV ad at the same time as the words that a person already knows it's happening. So like sweet law, when sweet would sweet Caroline would be anyway. You know what I mean? Like it's kind of budging it. not actually changing the words. You're just letting them show up in the same timing as those words would be while other things are happening on there. Do you get what I'm saying?
01:00:45 - mark sweet (3)
Yeah, the other idea would be to make Sam change her middle name to Caroline.
01:00:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And then we're going to show that route. Or you can show it to yours. yeah. Uh, Yeah. Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
01:01:03 - mark sweet (3)
So that may be the easier route.
01:01:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It me two weeks to get out of my head after saying that.
01:01:10 - mark sweet (3)
So Dan, just to bring up this stuff going on, theoretically using the Sweet Caroline song, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
01:01:20 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
The Red Sox love it, yeah.
01:01:24 - mark sweet (3)
But just instead of Caroline, it's three syllables.
01:01:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's like... Attorneys. Sweet, old turnies.
01:01:31 - mark sweet (3)
We love wins or something like that. And just play it on repeat because that song gets stuck in people's head like no other.
01:01:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, that's like jingles work because and so somebody gets in a wreck and they're like, oh, that stupid song is popping my head.
01:01:48 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh yeah. You can be like sweet claim of mine.
01:01:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
01:01:53 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh my gosh. of mine.
01:01:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Bada. Now you're mixing like sweet child of mine. I'm with the Neil time.
01:02:03 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
So that's what they sing at the Red Sox. That's why I was getting these things. We Carolina every game.
01:02:10 - mark sweet (3)
You definitely do.
01:02:10 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
And they do the pop.
01:02:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
my kids do it at their football games and all the kids stream it's a land. Anyway, okay.
01:02:21 - mark sweet (3)
You got to figure out how massage it to make it work, but.
01:02:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Well, I mean, all of these conversations can keep going throughout the weekend email so that we can we can keep traction. It doesn't have to be just Monday meeting calls. So keep that in mind too. But will you? Do you have any interest in trying to figure out what your purpose in life is? Yes. Okay.
01:02:58 - mark sweet (3)
So. Wait, continue what we're doing. Make sure that we have a profitable business.
01:03:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, that is not. That is not purpose. That's not purpose. The purpose of business is the make money period and story.
01:03:14 - mark sweet (3)
Yes.
01:03:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you do it is a whole other thing. The principles within that is a whole not a thing. But the purpose is simply make money and be profitable.
01:03:27 - mark sweet (3)
Fair enough.
01:03:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not a thing that gets you through the hard times. it's also not a thing that really helps you to even create the values. The values come from other things. Yeah, anyway, so I asked you, do you have interest in it? The next question would have been, will you work on it intentionally? But since the answer was, wishy washy at best. I don't know how much that answer was mean, but I'll ask it anyway. Do you want to work on it and find a person that can help you with it?
01:04:10 - mark sweet (3)
I want to build a snowman.
01:04:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
They do. OK, right.
01:04:20 - mark sweet (3)
have to build a snow.
01:04:23 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Why do you even know that?
01:04:26 - mark sweet (3)
Oh, I guess again.
01:04:27 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Things are stuck in the head. Why are you watching frozen Mark? That's you shouldn't even be familiar with this.
01:04:35 - mark sweet (3)
It's awesome.
01:04:37 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Yeah.
01:04:38 - mark sweet (3)
Sure, Mark. Deadpool and I highly recommend it.
01:04:43 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, my God. had to go. My mom is like in post-surgery. She's like, but she lives like loose with my brother. And I had like, not this big deal, but my brother was out of it. you need to be here Saturday at two thirty. I'm not going to be here because he was going to see Wolverine. And he came back and he was like, oh God, it was so good or so good. We're so good. He's like, I won't tell you anything I was gonna say it's not Tina proves and if I try to watch it with vid it probably cut out 75% of the movie. Oh Yeah When Deadpool came out we we went Denise was like, oh, let's go see Deadpool and I was like And I hadn't seen it so I like, I don't know if that's a good idea So we had the original Deadpool, which would be like 2010. Maybe I don't know so the kids were like under 10. Oh, no Like four minutes. Yeah, and then Denise was like Picking them up stuff like them out and then I stayed and watch the movie I'm not leaving They tried to get into a different movie And I do think that I think the ticket person was like, really? you can take these kids Isn't frozen.
01:05:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh Mark, I'm just going to follow up with you and text you and ask you that until you give me a, I don't want to do it, now or I'll work on it or you can tell me, no, is that approach? Okay, because I want you to think about it a little bit more and just make a decision, either you do want to work towards that or you don't, because then if you do, then that helps my approach. And if you don't, I need to alter it.
01:06:26 - mark sweet (3)
Yes, that makes sense.
01:06:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay. I'll keep following up with you then. And everybody go, have a good day and talk to you next week.
01:06:35 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Oh, bye-bye. Bye.
01:06:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, wait, wait, wait. What?
01:06:39 - Dan Ryan (danddcompany.com)
Hey, I sent the turn, the new turn down reasons to you and Patsy and then she never responded because she left him returning leave. He left. just put those in place.
01:06:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

> 00:00:01 - Chona Sweet
Hi. Can't hear you. You're muted. Yeah. are you? Good. Good. Just sweetest got home.
00:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Long day.
00:00:17 - Chona Sweet
It's okay. But yeah.
00:00:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, how has this been gone so far?
00:00:24 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it's getting a little better. I still feel sometimes I. Overwhelmed, but. And I. To be honest, I have a lot of charting.
00:00:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Because you just have a lot of calls or because you're behind and not doing it.
00:00:46 - Chona Sweet
Behind and doing it.
00:00:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So why is that? How much, how far behind are you, do you think? these wise.
00:01:03 - Chona Sweet
I have I'm looking at it right now. have 80 notes.
00:01:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Not including, huh? Go ahead.
00:01:12 - Chona Sweet
Not including maybe I have to say not including today. Like maybe close to 99 total. No. Yeah, 99 total. And the hospital. I just got home.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I haven't charted the hospital. When did you get started?
00:01:46 - Chona Sweet
hospital. was unable to do. I was able to chart every day. Like that one. I was able to do that every time. was And the lean patient that comes from me, I mean from my sources, from me, I was able to do that.
00:02:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So when you say you were able to, does that mean you're not able to when you work at the clinic?
00:02:20 - Chona Sweet
I guess what I want to say is I feel more motivated to finish the charting on the hospitals and ones that I really don't like, there's a lot of work on the heart charting in the hospitals. I mean, I'm sorry on the clinic and I don't, I don't really want to do it. That's really what it is. I really don't, I was able to do what I need to do in terms of, in terms of, like I prescribed their medications, but I wasn't able to to finish the note. But I feel like the main job that I need to do, I was able to do that, I guess that that makes sense. But the note I know is part of it, but I just been I've just been not doing, not keeping up maybe that's the time. The telemedicine is easy notes. Yesterday's telemedicine, I did it exactly at the same time as I was doing it. Today, I sleep in, so I was only able to call all my telemedicine, but I haven't started the note. I plan to do it tonight after dinner.
00:03:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So what time did you get started working today?
00:03:53 - Chona Sweet
I started working at 1.30 today.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What happened to the conversation? Last week about wanting to make a million dollars a year and the only way you're going to get started in morning.
00:04:06 - Chona Sweet
I started the morning yesterday.
00:04:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What time?
00:04:10 - Chona Sweet
Um, I started at 10. Well, no, I started working the moment I woke up I mean, yes, wait, what is today?
00:04:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Today's Thursday.
00:04:19 - Chona Sweet
Um, you see, when I woke up, usually would call my telemedicine and then I would go to the hospital. Today, that's not, I just sleep in. I just feel tired.
00:04:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I gave in and. You feel like you're burnt out?
00:04:39 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
00:04:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, is, is the clinic something that has to be done? Like is in order for you to have this arrangement with Dr. E towards building the.
00:04:54 - Chona Sweet
I think it's my help right now because of the rolling in of. the patients, the thousands that are coming in, and apparently we're just gracing that just the top and, you know, all of us are, you know, the other end piece we would talk to each other to just say hi and they said that they're also feeling overwhelmed because everyone has new patients and they double book because some patients don't show up, some show, you know, so it's like, for example, on Tuesday I have a schedule of 13, I think, in the afternoon, or I forgot 20, and then only more than half was seen, but because it's new, it's just a lot. So that's what I've been doing now so that it will be easier for me to chart later on is I Started pre charting, but correctly while I'm with the patient So, you know, that's that's what I've been doing versus a chicken scratch of Pain in low back like this and that you know, just one word two words. I don't do that now Oh, I you tell me you started that like a week or two ago though but No, I well I started probably a week ago, I feel like I I'm not consistent in terms of Doing that, but because if I feel like I'm already I feel I'm feeling overwhelmed and then I just start doing the words But now I've been like really doing it every patient that was that way when I taught it's faster when I finish it It's faster when you say now you're doing it consistently as of what day did you start doing it consistently oh I guess yet last week Monday true because I only have clinic Monday Tuesday And then the rest is sporadic Depending if I have lean patients Your charts how far are the oldest one go back One and a half weeks Um, it's not telemedicine. I'm on top of my telemedicine notes, but it's the it's the clinic new new patients. I'm It's like I'm dreading it like I'm dragging my feet and doing it because I It's just more work because I I just feel like And also there's a part of me sometimes that questions You know, it's just it's just worth it. It would come up because I feel like I have eight hours' worth of work for what? And I, comparison to what I used to work with my old job, that I only worked three and a half hours and I get paid the same exact thing. And so there's a part of me that, yeah, I'm trying to look past this. I'm looking past this and I'm trying to look at the potential, the earning potential, because of the lean patients, lean lean cases. I'm not seeing that yet.
00:08:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's slowly coming in, but it's... lean patients will come through the clinic? Will the lean patients come through the clinic? Yeah. I'm trying to get at is, is handling his clinic patients required to build the lean version of the business? Not required.
00:08:52 - Chona Sweet
It's just, I think, like...
00:08:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Here's what we have to really get to. So... you're having this internal wrestle and Eventually a decision is going to be made for you if you get so behind your stress levels is gonna make the decision Then you're gonna walk away Because it's too much and it's overwhelming or dr. E's gonna say don't do this anymore because you're not getting the charting done And this needs even though they're overwhelmed So I don't know where that's gonna happen at some point it breaks it either gets fixed or it breaks, right?
00:09:28 - Chona Sweet
I think It's not required if the answer your question is not required however Because the lean clinics maybe that's the term the lean clinics is not full running I Don't have a reason to say hey I cannot do your clinic patients now because I'm focusing on the lean we're not there yet I don't know how long look you take so okay, but
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, hold on a second and I need you to bear with me because I have a very analytical brain and I'm also very tenacious. I go after things. If there's a problem, I'm working to solve it because it's the only reason I'm here, right? So, week after week, it's been... You've got lots going on. Remember, you've got to take all this into account. There's a lot of learning, but now we're getting into where we're having the same conversation on repeat. And just so you know, I have a few cardinal rules. One of them is I don't have the same conversation on repeat without it making progress because I cost too much money to not make progress. And if that's happening, it's either that I'm not a good fit and a good batch for you, or you're not where you should be, so you're out of sync with your own self. I don't know that that's the case. But I need you to understand that that's the way that I look at things and that's the way that I process them. Okay, so I don't just care about the business. I don't just care about the money. I can't help but care about the person that I'm working with. So seeing you, you're you're having a dilemma that needs to be solved, but you are the only one who can solve it. And until you get bought into what you really want to do, you're not going to do it. And if you're not going to do it, there is no point in me showing up every week. Does that make sense? Right. So a few of the things are, for example, in terms of consistency. Now, I understand that charting is frustrating and difficult, but here's a few other things. asked you to report wins each day, just a win every day for the week and that doesn't get done.
00:12:00 - Chona Sweet
on.
00:12:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So let's see, hold on there or something else. Where's my Oh, so three weeks ago, I asked for and I asked for it multiple times, but I division of like what Cheryl does versus what you do, just kind of visualize I even started it graphically wrote it out for you. So there's some resistance that is happening. And I want to see if there's any way that I can help you with it. Without piling on, because it's very easy for everything to feel like piling on, like I can do stress. I can feel your overwhelm, I can feel your frustration, but also there's the mom in me that wants to make everything better. There's like I've got all these rolled tona, they come out and this doesn't mean I'm right.
00:12:54 - Chona Sweet
It's just the way that I work. That's all I'm saying. Right. And I change it.
00:12:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know. Hold on. I want to, I got
00:13:00 - Chona Sweet
get all the way through this.
00:13:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 99 charts to be behind on that, there comes a point where that you can't that can't not be taking up mental space and that cannot not be getting heavier. It has to start getting heavier and heavier. And so there is either an implosion or an explosion that's about to happen at some point. Now I don't know you, you might be somebody who can just like buckle down, sit down for the weekend and knock everything out.
00:13:31 - Chona Sweet
you that person? Yes.
00:13:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait, I just saw Mark shake his head.
00:13:38 - Chona Sweet
But I am that person though. I, I, I passionate and I'm not consistent. Those are my, I know my biggest weakness. But when I sit down and buckle down, like I would be awake for three AM, four AM sending emails to the point that they asked me to like, do you sleep? but in at night or because they see my emails at 3 a.m. 4 a.m.
00:14:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
because I need to send an email saying oh please get an authorization for epidural for this patient so I need to send each time so they can see that but I just feel I'm still in the overwhelmed stage and when I get overwhelmed I question if this is worth it and I start comparing what I when I used to do what I used to make before this is the problem you can't get out of overwhelm if you don't show up consistently and what you're saying is you're on an infinite loop of you're not going to show up consistently and still it it makes more sense to you but if you're looking if you're doing that math now here's the thing there's two math equations that we talked about the one is what you're making now versus what you made and then the other one is what is the potential if you see this thing through you have to decide which math you want to look at.
00:15:01 - Chona Sweet
Right? Because both are true. It's just some matter of what I mean.
00:15:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, well, one is potential true and one is current truth. I need to know like, are you have you decided your and now here's the other thing is you've got some room to change things just because you feel obligated to work in the clinic right now. According to what you said, that's not you need to work in the clinic enough to understand it and know how to handle the lean patients inside of his face. But you've already gotten to that point. So what would happen if you said, okay, I'll do five five patients in the clinic a day, everything else you have to handle and that make sure I stay fresh that I stay in here. But to be honest, that's not what I'm here for. I'm happy to help out in this way or that way, whatever thing you're actually willing to help out. But Jonah, if you're if you're going to build a business and if you're going to lead and create, make the rules that work for you. But what you can't do is agree to rules and then not keep them. Right. That will ruin everything even internally for yourself.
00:16:18 - Chona Sweet
I think if I really want to, I would. I know if you really want to, sorry. I think there's resistance within me because I don't really like the clinic work. But I know that it actually is important in building my clinic muscle, if that makes sense. Yeah. the clinic muscle is what also would help me with the lean patients in terms of recognizing, oh, this is where I'm hurting. Just the symptoms. But although even though I already know because it's just a matter of a few procedures, it still helps because the hospital patients and the clinic patients are totally different. Right. the clinic patients is comparable to the lean patients.
00:17:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, I get that.
00:17:19 - Chona Sweet
That's why it makes sense for me to do this.
00:17:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's just that. Are the lean patients going to be as much work charting?
00:17:30 - Chona Sweet
I mean, it isn't. It isn't because it is because I'm still new on it and I'm still trying to learn the lean type of charting. It's different from how we chart. This is where Mark comes in. This is where Dr. and I'm learning through the Zoom meeting every so often on how to chart correctly. And the resistance also is Dr. E. It's Dr. signing that lean patient notes and he's a little bit resistant on how Mark thinks and how it should be done because it's different from how we do our notes for patients where we're under scrutiny and their insurance.
00:18:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How you deal with that? How does that stress you out?
00:18:25 - Chona Sweet
I talked to Mark about it and again because I'm in the learning stage I feel I don't feel too confident to say to stand up for it but I'm still I'm still in the learning stage it's very early like Dr. E would ask me why don't we put this why because I really don't know how to answer the question I know but I don't feel confident to tell him like why are we doing And for right now, I'm just saying because this is how the rest of the PI doctors are doing it And this is what attorneys look for, but I feel like it's not enough. He hasn't bought into it yet. He's I think he's What's the right term, He's He's not fully bought in though.
00:19:19 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I don't think that honey like we're up to him to make changes and then we're not necessarily telling him why behind it There's some things that he understands why we're changing things like In a record, there's a subjective section and that's where most of the writing occurs Then there's a symptomology section where they're going through different tests, that's how they figure out what kind of pain Then there's a feeling portion and then there's a plan portion of pay.
00:19:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is what we're gonna do, right?-hmm.
00:19:48 - Chona Sweet
That's good that right honey like yeah for a four sections subjective what the patient says Also, yeah soap note so and he and he that's not how we charge right now with her patient. So in his mind, the way he thinks is if I get called in court of this patient that you saw, because he did in the past, you know, he's been called in, what's that term litigation?
00:20:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He's been deposed.
00:20:15 - Chona Sweet
He's been deposed. So the way he answered the question is, well, this is, I'm not doing this just for the lean patients, I'm doing this is the same thing I do with the rest of my patients who's being under insurance. So that's, in his mind, it's easier to I guess defend what he does because that's.
00:20:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But he's got liability for your main patients?
00:20:37 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Or not? Yes, because no one's signing it. So I talked because he understands his notes are not the best. I mean, he readily understands that he has false and his notes. His biggest issue was I want to leave in the different tests that we're doing with the patient and what the results are, where Fuji or pandellas or any of the ones. I worked with don't put that part in it doesn't make or break a case the only time it's a problem is that the client says I don't remember doing any of these tests and they're in the report It's the only time it's a problem. He's very open-minded to changing his subjective section at the top Because he's just got a very old-school way of doing it, but just right. Oh, it's cool Yeah, hey, and it's not born out of anything Negative like he's not It's just he just writes down what someone says.
00:21:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:21:28 - Chona Sweet
Oh, that's how we were trained.
00:21:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's how we were trained Yeah, but here we're taking a legal side of no, no, let's get them even less go through so they well Have you said anything you say can't and we'll be used against you or the court of law I mean it's that kind of premise right that if you have more than there's more to It's actually not a lot to he he doesn't really but he gets fixated on one thing That's not written there, but it's actually very small like for example on the third part on the
00:22:00 - Chona Sweet
assessment part. I'm sorry on the objective part. Old school note on objective, we do it by systems. General, meaning the patient is awake, alert, oriented. Respirations, patients, long sounds. We don't do that on the lean patients. I don't put the card, your card jack is the heart rhythm normal. Like I don't do that because we don't, I don't assess it because it's the, it's a lean patient. We're focused, like Dr. Fuji's note is on the Dr.
00:22:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Fuji's note, he says focus physical exam.
00:22:37 - Chona Sweet
E wanted more than three systems. He wants psychiatry, skin, you know, like the old school.
00:22:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So can you find examples of old school or more appropriately appear? So someone his age in this business that does it your way.
00:23:01 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, we killed him. He showed him and he says is someone who's in the same area.
00:23:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, roughly the same amount of practice who he's actually buy out and what he's doing. Here's the thing though. What Dr. E wants to add in doesn't make or break a case.
00:23:18 - Chona Sweet
It doesn't.
00:23:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. How much time does it take? What's the burden?
00:23:21 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
What's the issue? Not massive.
00:23:24 - Chona Sweet
I'm asking Jonah because it's not a lot. Right now what I've been doing for lean patients is just the general appearance of a patient, a neck and a musculoskeletal back. I could add psych. could add skin. Then that's it.
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You know, in two minutes, tell me why you're doing any of this.
00:23:51 - Chona Sweet
Why am I doing the lean?
00:23:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes, all this work with Dr. E in two minutes.
00:23:59 - Chona Sweet
I'm sorry. which one like all of it or yeah any of it like why do you show up to work every day I show up to work every day because I have to and I have I have to and I want to do the let work in the especially in the hospital I really do hold on a second hold on a second so I need you to tell me but I also need it to be true do you have to I feel like no one will be no one will be able to replace me to see those patients or I guess they can I guess they can replace me but I don't know I mean as much as I'd love to say I'm irreplaceable it might take four people to do my job but I'm not irreplaceable I don't think yeah they're right but we need to be real about the language because here's the thing if you don't tell the whole trip your brain is gonna find a loophole and it's going to tug at that
00:25:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and take you off track. So 100% all true, why do you show up to work every day?
00:25:07 - Chona Sweet
I need to work.
00:25:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I need to make money. No. Do you need to?
00:25:13 - Chona Sweet
I need to.
00:25:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What will happen if you don't?
00:25:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, and then I won't have money. I am going to rely on Mark, which I don't like that.
00:25:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you feel compelled to because the feeling of relying on Mark doesn't feel good, but the truth is you don't need to and your brain knows that. Probably that's why there's no probably about your brain knows you don't have to, which makes you feel like you've got room to make choices and the choice can be, well, I'm going to do it this way and whatever happens happens. They don't have to. That's what's happening every day.
00:25:59 - Chona Sweet
That's what the wrestle is right don't have to and no matter how you phrase it the powerful chona inside knows you don't have to right so that can't be if you tell yourself that story you're wasting time and you're lying to yourself and you're setting yourself up for failure so something happens the other day and i just want to say it and then you tell me then then why because dr e was in the hospital yesterday for a he did a procedure for one of our patient and then he asked me he called me i did the procedure for the patient do you want me to rounds on the patient because i'm already here that's what he says but then you know it's up to you whatever you want to do because he's that kind of doctor he's fine he's i'm here do you want me round down many patients do we have and then i said oh we only have i believe 17 or 18 then i told him no i no it's okay i'll i'll
00:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
round.
00:27:01 - Chona Sweet
So what does that tell you?
00:27:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I am, you know, because maybe I'm not eating it because I want to see my patients. You like the hospital though?
00:27:11 - Chona Sweet
I do. That's different.
00:27:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But that's not the issue. Here's, here's the thing is where you're not showing up. That's the only issue. But you have to show up. Like you either need to be all in or get out because you're talking about building a business. And even if you were an employee, if I have somebody that was that far behind after a week and a half out of fire done, I didn't care what helped their giving me. I need to know that they're going to show up consistently. Now that's my particular baseline. That's not everybody's I hire differently, I train differently, I fire differently. It's just, but business has to be nuanced and it has to match the person, the visionary. You do have a very specific clear vision. But as we said, you're building in somebody else's house. Okay, you have to take that into account and you have to decide are you going to make your own? Which can mean I will do five clinic patients a day no more so that I do get familiar with it But because they are slightly different than lean patients because I only going to take notes this particular way when they're Lean patients and also because I just don't like it and you have the freedom to be truthful about it What's he going to say no I don't want the lean patient money? No, I don't want you to help me with at least five patients Which is 25 patients a week? Why would anybody say that? Do you know what I mean?
00:28:38 - Chona Sweet
Right?
00:28:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just feel like we're not I think what here's what I do here. Chona. I think that you can take more power Actively rather than possibly you're taking the power by not doing your work. That's possibly And actively you can take the power by saying I don't like this may sound bad, but that's the reality. love the hospital patients. Great. Some people probably don't like any of the patients. You should be happy about that. You are going to do some helping with the clinic patients and you're going to bring in lean business, which is going to help him have an entirely new income stream that wasn't available. That is sufficient. That is enough value. You live in a world where, first of all, as a woman and then also as a minority, but especially the women in your culture even, you're taught to take care of everything and to do the job and to be happy about it and to smile while we're doing it. But Feisty Chona is inside of there too and she's like, I don't like it. I don't want to do it. And Mark is nice. He can't care of myself. There's all these things going on. Chona, you're not- bad, or mean, or angry, or a , because that's what people like to call you, not you per se, but women, when they act the way that they want to act, you're not doing anything wrong. If you say, don't like this, it's burning me out. I may not even get to growing the lean business if you just crash and burn. So how about we put some guardrails on this, and we say, I'll do five, maybe 10 lean patients a day, 50 max, and I will do my charting day of, and I will agree to that. And I catch up, catch up this weekend, and just put the walls on it that actually works so that you can't get burned out. And then if you're still getting burnt out after that, you really need to have a heart to heart with yourself about what you're doing.
00:30:48 - Chona Sweet
So, right, that makes sense on the five patients a day, because I feel like right now, that's what I have, but I compacted. Monday, Tuesday, which gives me more free time on Wednesday, Thursdays, and Fridays to put in and also it's hard. I feel like I cannot Go fully tell him that oh, I'm just gonna do the lean because that we don't have a Lot of lean patients yet.
00:31:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, okay, pause pause again This is an issue with you feeling like you owe him something or you're gonna please him or something. Hold on Let me see this all the way through You're building a business the business not there. That doesn't mean like, you know, if you let's say you open up a store and you're like well I'm not gonna I don't know what it is, but let's say you just open up a practice and it's a doctor's practice And you're there But like I'm not gonna be here because there's no people you're gonna stay there and and do the job You do what's there the lean business is the perfect reason that you're that If that didn't exist, would you even be doing any business with Dr. E if that wasn't a potential?
00:32:05 - Chona Sweet
No, I wouldn't.
00:32:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so your logic doesn't really make sense and because to me that's like guilt and you feel compelled like you're supposed to do something to please somebody else.
00:32:21 - Chona Sweet
He did verbalize it to me to mark that yeah, that he needs help with the clinic.
00:32:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, he can hurt people. How is that your problem? Now you guys, you can fix me.
00:32:35 - Chona Sweet
I'm coming at it.
00:32:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This is this is what I do. If I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong.
00:32:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
I mean, there's some good news in all this because I talked to Dr. E was yesterday because he's bringing on two more hospitals. He understands children prefer his hospital over clinic practice that this is not a surprise to him because she does. She really enjoys the hospital setting and they probably like her if she likes it then. Dr. He's one of the guys where it's just yeah, whatever like he's.
00:33:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, I mean the patient.
00:33:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So Are you kidding me like they love her right? Okay, so keep going sounds good be I mean The goal is to get her to be primarily hospital link right this right Maybe one day a week because five a day wouldn't make her run around more where it would be efficient got it week And clinic would make more sense. Okay, you can see everyone a single day and use the clinic because I grew it You got to be used to clinic. You're gonna do lean treatment. I Put this is like when I started my firm like you kind of got to go through You don't necessarily like to reach the brass ring that you're going for it's short-term pain for long-term payoff But he definitely is drowning in the clinic But that being said he will take whatever lifeboat he can get at the moment Because he just needs whatever helping you get but it's still his boat chona.
00:33:59 - Chona Sweet
This is what I need you same.
00:34:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's his vote to manage. So if you want to help, help under your terms in a way that does not burn you out, but then let him handle the rest of it and be a grown- man. don't mean it disrespectfully to Dr. E. I'm using hard language because I need it to be very clear because your language, you dodge things a little bit and it's not to your benefit. I'm trying to, this is not just you by the way.
00:34:35 - Chona Sweet
Yes, yes.
00:34:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Other people do this. We do this. want to be peacemakers and find the thing and sometimes the truth is uncomfortable. But you have so much power in you and it's, I definitely feel, I'm sorry, it's okay.
00:34:54 - Chona Sweet
I definitely feel not confident and not comfortable with my lean. notes and it's frustrating to um rely on mark to correct it.
00:35:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you remember the driving analogy?
00:35:10 - Chona Sweet
Yes.
00:35:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're not going to get comfortable until you have a certain amount of experience under your belt and you have to either be okay with that or let it ruin you.
00:35:21 - Chona Sweet
And also like I have a lot of question because I'm seeing the patients. I'm writing the preliminary notes but Dr. E is signing it and then I ask Mark about this. Like should we write something in the bottom saying initially seen by nurse practitioner? I don't know.
00:35:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like should I ask the questions? Are you are you do you have access to ask the questions?
00:35:46 - Chona Sweet
Like if you have a question can you ask Mark can you ask anybody that you need to? Yeah no I asked him he said no I don't need to I don't know Dr. E just accept whatever I do and I don't want him been trouble. I don't want us to be in trouble because it's it's it's all Dr. East, but he's not seeing the patient I am. So can you handle emotional discomfort very well? Not very well.
00:36:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you want to be able to handle emotional discomfort?
00:36:21 - Chona Sweet
I feel like I do, but not probably. I feel like that's a very well.
00:36:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you want to have emotional discomfort? means when it comes, do you want to be able to handle it and work through it so it doesn't dominate you?
00:36:37 - Chona Sweet
Yes, of course.
00:36:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Okay. The only way to get there? That's a muscle. That muscle, you know how hypertrophy works, right? Tear, heal, grow. It's hypertrophy that you need to have happening in you on an emotional level. This is uncomfortable. It's going stay uncomfortable, the only way to get comfortable is to continue to do it. And to do it consistently, it will happen fastest with the most consistency. And I will say in addressing the issue, so if you get an unsatisfactory answer, you need to push for more specificity. So if you can't get it from go to mark, and then you remind us to look, you guys, we're in business. I'm the one that has to do this thing, and I, I'm not going to do it. If I don't feel confident that I'm doing it right, my brain doesn't work that way. I will stress myself out to death if I can't feel confident in it. So maybe there's some level of discomfort I have to deal with, but at the very least, you can give me an accurate, clear answer, and I don't care. Nobody gets to give you and I don't care.
00:37:57 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I definitely. It's the amount of confidence Dr. E is putting on me, it is, you know, it's definitely scary because I would do the notes. Do you care about your job? Yes.
00:38:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You try really hard.
00:38:20 - Chona Sweet
Not hard enough, baby.
00:38:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
how it asks you. I said do you try really hard?
00:38:25 - Chona Sweet
I think I try hard.
00:38:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you know anybody that does any job perfectly?
00:38:29 - Chona Sweet
No.
00:38:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, are you holding yourself to unrealistic expectations?
00:38:40 - Chona Sweet
Not sure.
00:38:45 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's a few things that we have to work here. The biggest thing, this is a loop. We're caught in a loop right now. This is your lack of confidence and your first with the finances and because you're comparing apples to right now, the other job you had and how much it made versus this job plus the potential with also you like the hospital work but not the clinic work. So you've got all these things and those things are causing you to not show up. You not showing up is causing you to not get good at the things which will give you confidence. The only way through this is for you to make a firm decision period and then show up regardless of what it feels like. Do you have the ability to force yourself to do that and if the answer is yes the things have to change first. Do you have the fortitude to make the changes even if you feel uncomfortable by leaving him hanging because he needs more help.
00:40:06 - Chona Sweet
Yes, the answer is yes. I can do that.
00:40:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay.
00:40:11 - Chona Sweet
In your words then, what can you Um, well, I wanted to do continue the hospital to telemedicine and limit the time.
00:40:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, like one day a week, like Mark was saying, so you're not driving there so often.
00:40:37 - Chona Sweet
Right now it's two days a week, right now it's Monday, Tuesday.
00:40:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, cutting it down just Monday helped you out. Make a difference.
00:40:45 - Chona Sweet
I think it will. I will have to tell him about it.
00:40:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm going teach you about energy sandwiches.
00:40:53 - Chona Sweet
Because right now they, they schedule a way in advance.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, you're going to have to get through that, but I'm going to tell you this really quick for your difficult conversation, okay? Before you have to go do something that really, really, really sucks, do something that you really, really like in kimbooster energy, could be your favorite song, if there's a song that comes on and you can't wiggle, there's like a billion of those for me, put that on. If it's eating something, if it's going outside, if it snuggles, it does not matter what it is. If there is something that fills you up and makes you feel good, do that first, and then plan for something good, also like it, especially if it's physical. Physical activities are very good for helping to get stress out of the body, a workout, but any good physical activity of a husband, I'll let you be creative. I'm just telling you, it's important to understand the ways to manage stress and difficult things. When you're growing through difficult periods and you have to do uncomfortable things, it's really important to be conscious about what you're doing before. or after because you can help yourself get through those things without residual stress, which helps prevent or alleviate existing burnout. You're already burnt out. This is a danger zone. I do everything I can in all of my stuff to prevent burnout. All of the systems that I create, all of the processes I create are to prevent burnout because once it happens, and businesses crash, people quit, relationships go to crap, all kinds of bad things happen. Burnout is really dangerous on a physical level, on a stress level. It keeps psychiatrists and psychologists in business. It's a big thing and you're here right now. So the only way to get this is to power through it. But there are tools that you can give to kind of stack the depth for you. And it's just being conscious of the things that physically in a moment can Boost your energy like without fail. It might be sabotage to go eat cheesecake before you go have a difficult conversation But if that conversation is life-altering and it's gonna change the course of your career one cheesecake I'm gonna kill you. Don't tell my doctor. said that I have diabetes, but whatever. I Don't care I use tools. I use energy so sunshine when the Sun is out I am a bear in the winter. struggle so bad because I'm so affected by the weather today I napped for hours and I didn't want to because it was slushy like when when Whenever the weather's like that the black oak hurt and I don't even know it's bad and I still feel different Anyway, energy is really important and you have to manage it and it will help you mentally Be able to get over things you have to put things in the parameters that will work for you and Stop doing it because you feel like you have to do something you have a conversation with Mark like does it? to be like this. What happens if I do this? Not, will he be mad? Not will I not be helping enough? That that's not your job. Your job is to go bring in a new source of income. Inside of that, there are things that you need to know. You need to know how to work in his office. You need to know how to do the charting correctly for the liens because it's a legal issue versus just, you know, but if you know that you love the hospital and he's got patients that you can be helpful with air, if you know that you're understanding the clinic enough that as the lien patients come in, you're going to do a good job. And in the beginning, you can spend extra time with Mark, any other doctor that can help you out, make sure that you're covering everything right. Then you need to trust that over time, it's going to be like driving the car. All of these scary decisions that you have to mentally process are just going to be automatic.
00:44:57 - Chona Sweet
Great.
00:44:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But... But it starts with getting up, going to work, catching up on your part and not getting behind. If you have, you catch yourself getting behind, then have a threshold where like if I'm 20 behind, if I'm 30 behind, I don't go anywhere, I don't sleep in, don't anything until I've caught up. Like created, I don't know what the number is, I just were out of number, but you need to create that because here's what you need to remember is that if you get over a threshold, you will burn out. It just will happen. There will be a burnout threshold. You've already hit it. So keep all of those things in mind. And then the other thing I need you to know is that I think we were together good. really like it. But if I need you to do the assignments, so like sending me the wins, I'll tell you the reason that I ask for them is because of energy. want you to focus on something good at the end of today. I want to purposely shift your energy to something that you're happy about. Right. Just because I asked now, if you said, Tina, I don't want to do that, we wouldn't do it. You didn't. You just didn't do the work. And I'll give you an example. So I used to ask Mark to do a gratitude journal. And we talked about talked about and he didn't do it. And he's like, I don't really want to do that. That's not my thing. Like, okay, he's like, but this is what I am doing. I'm taking Dolce for a walk and we go for walks in the morning. And you know, so he came up with his own system that helps affect his energy that worked for him. So you don't need to follow anybody blindly. That is not going to be where you find the most joy or success. It's where you go, okay, I see the concept. I think for some value in that, but that system that you're coming up with, Tina, that doesn't work for me. How about we do this or how about I do that. Like I want you to drive. I'm here to facilitate not to drive. Does that make sense?
00:47:08 - Chona Sweet
Right. It does. I think I'm definitely not good and I tell Mark and I don't tell you. That's that's the difference. And I tell him like my wins. I was we were just talking when I was driving and I said this is what happened today. This patient said this and this to me. There's positive and negatives and I'm taking the positives. So I'm not good in telling you that but I do tell Mark. And I do like the sending voicemas. Sometimes though I get so I feel bad sending you late late at night.
00:47:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
don't know. No I put everything in.
00:47:57 - Chona Sweet
Do not disturb.
00:47:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can send me anything you want to. Anytime.
00:48:00 - Chona Sweet
Okay, because I, I'm sure there are those messages before that it was so late.
00:48:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, you've never thought of me.
00:48:08 - Chona Sweet
I'm surprised that you respond sometimes.
00:48:11 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Uh, I have teenagers, so we sleep when we sleep. Also, I was born an insomniac. I'm not an insomniac. actually sleep really good, but I'm a, I wake up at night. can be exhausted all day for three days in a row. I can exercise. can do everything to wear myself out and be exhausted around 10 o'clock.
00:48:31 - Chona Sweet
My body goes, let's go.
00:48:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that's annoying.
00:48:34 - Chona Sweet
You, you mentioning that that actually is something I needed to say is ever since I start working there long ago now. Is it one and a half month, huh? I started September, but one and a half month, I wake up at three and four and I know when that happens, I'm stressed out. So I think, and then I try to sleep more.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can't, that's why I'm sleeping in. You know that that's when quarter
00:49:00 - Chona Sweet
All peaks two to three o'clock in the morning.
00:49:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did you also know that one of the biggest reasons that happens is late nine meals? I learned that recently.
00:49:09 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I've been eating bait because sometimes I would finish my charting 11, 30, 12.
00:49:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually forced myself to sleep. So one of the things that I learned is that if you just take like a 20-minute walk after whenever you eat, even if you're just walking in place and pacing around the house, I know that because I do that. It can offset that cortisol spike at two or three o'clock in the morning, which generally is combined with a potty break because the cortisol empties your bladder. I don't know if you know that but that happens a lot.
00:49:42 - Chona Sweet
So that happens even when I fast. do fasting sometimes. do long fasting and that happens even with that. So I think you're right. It's just that I feel, I do that when I'm grieving Yeah
00:50:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I'm stressed out so it's I would back it back to energy management and stress management and knowing yourself and doing whatever just Do you do like do you know what actually it calms you and makes you peaceful? Is there anything that you know of that? I just do that.
00:50:20 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I just playing and by doing nothing Just doing this What are you doing when you're laying in bed, but I would read stories or I would do tik-tok just mindless And I want something funny. I want to laugh like I would When I when I see something funny and then I read the comments that makes me laugh So I laughing is is very good for me.
00:50:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm a big snuggler snuggler's work for me But there's only one person and he's in Arizona So I don't get that access a lot my my grandbaby though. I got to hold her that would do it for me Um, when it's summertime being out in the pool. I'm that's so happy. When I get lots of sunshine, I'm very happy. um, massages, my masseuse is amazing. Um, she does reflexology. That's something, but you could also, you know, I don't know when's the last time you went to the doctor and had your lab checked, had your personal levels checked.
00:51:19 - Chona Sweet
Have you thought about me doing that? Sure.
00:51:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know.
00:51:23 - Chona Sweet
I know where the worst patients, I know this mark. I remember when meeting Mark long when we first met, I went the one like encouraging him and pushing him on to seeing his doctor and do this, do that, get, get your vaccines. then now he's very good in taking care of himself. And then I am not so amazing in these lives that I've worked with.
00:51:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm like, not because of me.
00:51:52 - Chona Sweet
I mean, I've just watched it is what I mean. Yeah, I know he's very good in taking care of himself and, you know, that's commendable. But you probably want you to take care of yourself, too, right? I Don't want to say that I'm giving myself grace and isn't you know in during this grace period But I I feel like I am in that grace 90 day period of this new place When you're building a business, it's it's grit that you need more than grace and Now look Right, it's a shift of mindset. I'm not I feel like I'm not totally there yet This is the first time I'm doing this and I feel It's not fully shifted my my mindset and Can I ask you a question that Just ask me okay Do you talk your do you are you good at talking your way out of things and have you done that your whole life? Oh, yeah, you think you're doing that now, right? I'm rationalizing why why I do what I do or how I why I
00:53:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
what I feel. Is that getting you where you want to be?
00:53:04 - Chona Sweet
No, but I feel it's what I need at the moment to comfort myself.
00:53:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that goes back to you. Do you want to deal with be able to deal with emotional discomfort?
00:53:17 - Chona Sweet
I mean, that would be emotional comfort, but do you want to be able to deal with it? I feel like we've been dealing with it.
00:53:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
just don't know if it's the right thing. what just we're gonna have next week's call and if you think I'm right about anything, all I want you to do is just say you're right and just not explain it, not anything and just sit with it. It's really gonna suck. I want you to be able to sit with things being uncomfortable and not need to fix it or try to make a feel better. Will you do that with me next week?
00:53:57 - Chona Sweet
Okay.
00:53:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you see? any benefit in doing that?
00:54:01 - Chona Sweet
You mean, like, for example, what's you mean?
00:54:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like, well, if I went through and looked at the notes from today's call, we can talk about multiple reasons, multiple issues that we brought up, and then you explaining what's happening. And I don't want you to do that. I want you to acknowledge, there's something that isn't going the way that adopt you, and just sit in it, and not explain it. Just let that sit there and not try to make it feel better. Does that doesn't make sense now? don't know. I probably didn't change it at all.
00:54:39 - Chona Sweet
That makes sense.
00:54:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's just practice. It's just acclimation. I am a type A perfectionist. I was picked on a lot, and also, firstborn daughter, so people pleaser. But also, I learned, because I'm a very angry abusive mom, literally abused me. And so I got really good with dodging the hand with my mouth by saying things to placate and please and excuse and to justify. And I'm also very smart, I'm good at doing that, but I was blessed to have people call me out of my crap. And because of them, I grew and I want to grow more than I want to be comfortable. I want to grow more than I want to be right. That wasn't always true because being wrong was so uncomfortable for me. It physically painful, I still get physical anxiety, I will replay everything I've said every day to everyone, even if they thought it was great and look at all the ways I did wrong. Still, I'm 48 years old. should not be... doing it. So now I do it way less than I used to. But there's still a lot of anxiety. And I feel like crying telling you about it. It's a physical, visceral response. Like I could hang up and just go cry for five minutes. And it's stupid to me. I don't want to do that. That's annoying. It's frustrating. I'm strong. And that crying would not keep me from doing the hard thing. But I'm like, I don't say the things that would make me uncomfortable or say all the things that made me uncomfortable. But Chona, there is so much liberation in being able to sit in emotional discomfort and being able to be wrong and being able to be exposed in wrongness and learn the ear with people who will be like, okay, so Mark and I work with Dan. Also, it happens with Mark. I'll say something and I'll be completely wrong. Just cool. is wrong, not understand something, Dan will just completely disagree with me. he'll make that sound, but he's not being disrespectful. He's just got his thoughts and his opinions, and it's a safe space. But because I was able to sit and not try to be like, why did you say this? no, I didn't mean that, you know, and try to make it better. I've learned that I can just be myself around people, but also I can ask difficult questions, or I can say some of my crazy thoughts. And a lot of times they're right, and they're good. And because I'm bold enough to do that, because I'm okay with being wrong, I get to have the joy and the experience of being bold, right? And I also get to have the learning experience of being wrong and being corrected quickly, or redirected, or instructed quickly. So, or you can just get a new perspective, because I'm willing to say things and be vulnerable. Most people don't like it. make a lot of people uncomfortable, especially my Sunday school teachers. Most of them can't stand me. that's okay. But because of that, I've just found my niche in this world and it's amazing because I felt hated all of my childhood and a good portion of my adulthood, especially I married somebody that treated me just like my mom did. So my point is is that the only way to get comfortable and to not feel trapped by emotional discomfort is just to kind of embrace it. But I can tell you like not many people can from experience the power of the contrast between being trapped by trying to avoid that discomfort and the power of just fully embracing it and asking difficult questions, making demands like, okay, I'm not going to work more than one day a week. And you know what, I'm only going to do one day a week every other week because I really don't like it. And I'm just going to take this whole week off like whatever whatever it is you've got to figure out what works for you. But trust that if you're managing it that way, you're going to be in your superpowers. That means like when you're at the hospital taking care of hospital people, you're going to be the best down nurse protection they've ever seen. And they're going to love you. And you're going to do amazing. And then when you do the lean patients, you're going to have more energy for that because you're not burning out with the other things that you don't want. Nobody is going to architect the ideal situation for you, but you can. You just have to be honest about what you're doing, why you're doing it. What you don't want to do, stop doing what you don't want to do or tell yourself, I'm going to, because it really is going to be the only way that I get to what I want to. But whatever it is, make sure that you're telling the same story all day, every day, or what you're going to have is this dissonance inside of yourself, and it's really going to rip at you.
01:00:22 - Chona Sweet
Understood.
01:00:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What do you think about that more than understood?
01:00:30 - Chona Sweet
I know that I'm not doing really good, I'm not 100% in. I feel that I'm just doing it because to show face right now, I could, myself, because to show face for myself. self. I know that I'm not consistent.
01:01:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you think you can have these?
01:01:07 - Chona Sweet
I know, I know I can be. just have to make that decision that I'm fully fully in. I mean, you know, yeah, I just feel I'm not there yet because I don't want to be. I'm not.
01:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's true. That's what that's what you need to do is be flexible.
01:01:34 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I'm not decision that you're that you're in yet. Yeah, I thought I would be in and then I realized Oh, this is this is a lot of work. I don't write. I don't like this.
01:01:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So ask this question though Is there a way that you see where you can be in like maybe you only do clinics twice a month one day every other week? I know that might sound extreme to you and I don't know. that's reality. But what I'm asking you, is there a way that you can craft the situation?
01:02:06 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, I think I think I I think I've become money focus. And the reason why I say that is I noticed myself committing more to my lean patients in clinic patients. So I will work around, I will drive to wherever I set the page. For example, I called the patient and I gave them two options where they can go and they go far from Huntington Beach. They went there, they went to the south location. So I drove there no problem early, like 9.30, like I don't have a problem. So I noticed that I definitely lit up when I know that this is and make me more. I think that's where it's that. And I feel that the current one is it's not where it's at. That's why I don't like it. And that's the truth that as much as I say, I don't want to treat patients just because of the money. But the lean patient, it's hard not, it's hard not to admit that it is the truth.
01:03:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So you could stop judging yourself and that's okay, that's what motivates you.
01:03:24 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, it does motivate me like, okay.
01:03:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, so be okay with that. Practice being able to say the whole truth exactly as it is. I'm not insinuating your lying or anything. I'm saying is just that's emotional discomfort also to claim what you want and who you are and be okay with it.
01:03:47 - Chona Sweet
By the way, what I just told you is totally against my ethics would work. Because I don't, this is, and I've worked with, I work at Cedars, I work with UCLA. We were, I take care of whatever from homeless to Prince of Dubai or whatever. I know that's the one thing that I hate is, but I just need to say because I don't know why because it's it's it's against what it is that everybody is there is no such thing as altruism.
01:04:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I'll tell you why if I do something just to make you smile and make you feel good, this side effect is going to be, I know I made you smile and feel good and it's boost to my ego and I get the joy of your energy. I know I get something back even if it's just feeling like I did something for you. There is no real pure altruism. We are all motivated by what we get back, whether we acknowledge it or not. Right. There are different currencies. Sometimes we get happiness back.
01:05:00 - Chona Sweet
we get comfort back. Sometimes we get a favor back.
01:05:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sometimes we get a paycheck, but we all receive a currency for our currency that we extend out to others. So then everybody's out of right?
01:05:17 - Chona Sweet
Or nobody is.
01:05:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people are just more honest about it than others. Let ask you one more thing. If you go and make a million dollars, are you going to keep it all to yourself?
01:05:29 - Chona Sweet
Are you going to spoil the people that you love? I mean both, definitely, because I would love to spoil, you know, if you, and then what did I get from that? go, I get what you're saying, but I guess what I'm trying to say is because when I used to work, I work as an employee in my mind. I'm just, I'm doing this because of my job, but not directly because I'm getting, it's hard to explain yourself that not what I'm going to tell you. Yeah, just the mindset, the shift on the business mindset is different. And I don't, Knowing if I'm if I'm overthinking it Judging yourself.
01:06:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's what you've been doing with everything. You're judging your handwriting You're judging your language. You're judging your motives, and you need to stop that If you want to be happy You've got to just embrace who you are and know that other people are blessed for knowing you this guy loves you Like there's got to be something good about you. Your patients love you Your family loves you, I would assume You just being you I mean not all families, but so Just love you and be okay with that and know that You getting what you want and what energizes you and motivates you makes you a more potent version of you Makes you get more good things done Whatever the children of things are you're gonna be more empowered because you're gonna Stop being held down by a judgment and direction and shame and doubt.
01:07:02 - Chona Sweet
Right. Right. I could. I could do a lot more with being having a routine and having time management because controlling my own schedule is the best and that more thing that can happen to me.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes.
01:07:23 - Chona Sweet
So we can talk about that, but ultimately you're the only one who can do anything about it.
01:07:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. It has to be a bigger thing other than I'll be more productive if I have a better schedule. have bigger reasons. You'll sleep better. You'll probably make better decisions because we know cognitive function drops when you're tired and exhausted. You'll be more healthy, more consistent. The close levels will be more level, which means your cravings will be more level, which means your energy levels will be more level. Like if there's, if you want to sit there and have lots of conversations to try to motivate yourself, we could do that. the end of the day, it's going to come down to rob discipline.
01:08:04 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:08:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The discipline is a muscle. You work it slowly, you grow it slowly. It doesn't happen all at once.
01:08:13 - Chona Sweet
And almost always, it looks like this. Right. Mark wakes up very early and well, initially for Dolce, but you know, even without Dolce, still wakes up early.
01:08:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And you guys are opposite like circadian rhythm types.
01:08:33 - Chona Sweet
Right. I'm work, I sleep late, I woke up late. I mean, even if I sleep early, I woke up 3, 4 a.m. then I sleep in again.
01:08:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And there's not a solution to everything when it comes to sleep and schedules. Some of it is just rough. That's life. We can't solve for everything.
01:08:55 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
All sort of saying, I am for me in our office.
01:08:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
If I want to sleep in late, I really couldn't. Yeah, so what I want you to think about is what can you be the architect of what can you change and I don't mean just yourself like Did I have your read that book switch?
01:09:12 - Chona Sweet
No, I haven't that's fine.
01:09:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I will power.
01:09:16 - Chona Sweet
I need you to read that book. I have it on like audible That's another thing we've talked about that you said you were doing didn't do it. need.
01:09:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah um, I said you'd like to read at night.
01:09:28 - Chona Sweet
It's relaxing No, it's I listen to I like listening to the books.
01:09:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I start listening to the 48th, but that I wasn't able to Complete it do you switch because it's how to make change when change is hard Right and it's entertaining. They did a good audible version.
01:09:46 - Chona Sweet
It's very good. So I would say though that in terms of Cheryl I think we were able to go past the resist I mean in a way because now for example the two patients that comes in they emailed me first we are only two months in by the way that's pretty good yeah they emailed me first and then i see see her and then the other person that you know is in charge with the lien it's cast and Cheryl i emailed them so they're part of that loop of email with this case manager of this lawyer so and it's been work i send them the the notes and then cast send the bill of she sent my name on the bill as a provider or as the medical provider i told her changes make it dr e which she did it it worked so it you know architected that you know saying you did it your way right i wanted that yeah she she said she said no tell them to email me it's like no no no no that's not how it's going to work but also i've become i i you know she we just celebrated her but at her birthday the other day and I was there. I'm showing up for the other non-work part. I really wanted to be okay with not just with her but everyone. I don't know about pug stuff, was cute. Yeah, he's a dog person.
01:11:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So he got her a pug. That's a good thing.
01:11:21 - Chona Sweet
like dog people.
01:11:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know she's four not dog people.
01:11:25 - Chona Sweet
She's never met a person who's not a dog person that I liked. She works hard too. think she realized now that okay I'm not trying to take away or be not including you. She's included on everything that I do.
01:11:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's really good growth in two months.
01:11:43 - Chona Sweet
So I feel good about a lot of the things that are happening but and also if you're not okay well that was that's a test um but
01:12:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I do. I we have to get, um, you know, anyway, we talk about pacing, but also looking at the clock and I think somebody's got plans tonight.
01:12:10 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes, we do very pretty soon, but this is really, really, really important because it's or get off the pot kind of type situation. You know, those when I use language like that. We have a prostitution analogy today.
01:12:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh, but you're not serious. I already had to apologize to God today.
01:12:30 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Anyway, either here nor there. Next up, these things about me anyway. I think for tell me if I'm wrong, but this seems like what you want to do because you understand how it's different than what you were doing before in terms of what your long-term potential is and correct me if I'm wrong because I think what's in this saying and I don't mean to speak for you again, but if you were much happier what you were doing before and you want to be handcuffed or only earning a certain amount. you are able to physically show up and not have the flexibility that you want or the ability to make more money, but do you have to work differently and harder? There's nothing wrong with that. It's just admitting to yourself, this is what I want. And I know I nudged you in this direction pretty hard, but if this isn't what you want, it's better to say now than in a year from now.
01:13:23 - Chona Sweet
Mm-hmm. I think it's definitely hard for me not to compare, especially when I'm feeling tired and I feel like I'm doing much more work as compared to that. And I'm not even touching the potential business potential, earning potential, the other earning potential, but I'm understanding or I'm accepting that it's part of it. It's part of it, I guess.
01:13:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just, so here's what I want like, you know, Ponderon is being the architect, okay? So when you tell yourself something about what you have to do, I want you to ask yourself, but is that true? What is actually true and what else could be true? Because sometimes opposing truths exist and it's difficult to understand how they can because it exceeds our reasoning, right? But we can sense, there seems to be evidence that this truth is true and this truth is true, but how they don't make sense. So think about, is there a way to change things so that it's not feeling like it's draining you? And also be the architect of the dialogue in your head. are you telling yourself? you catch yourself comparing the old jobs, Are you looking for a way to talk yourself out of doing your work or justifying not doing your work or making yourself comfortable with an uncomfortable situation, and ask yourself the things that I want is what I want most to make myself feel better about how I'm doing, or do I want to get to this thing and be able to deal with discomfort for a little while. So think about this conversation a little bit. If you want to send you the notes, don't know if you would read it and go back over it and look at some of the highlights, or I could just give you the bullet points of these are the things that kind of contemplate that we were talking about today. And here's the thing when you're when you're going through a growth period, your perspective shifts. I can't think of the word that I want right now. It's just I feel like my blood sugar is one of my crazy. hold on.
01:15:58 - Chona Sweet
Anyway, it's too much.
01:16:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're dark, but that's also, um, um, you change drastically, your perspective changes drastically, you're operating from a different standpoint, your motives and your opportunities are shifting. Um, in your perspective is shifting and part of it is allowing yourself to be honest and just say, I'm motivated by money as a healthcare worker. Fuji, I'll give you an example. I don't think he would be upset that I said this, but I asked him, you know, so why do you become a doctor? He's like, money, he's like, like, you know, he's like, I shouldn't say this, but the truth is it was a path to financial freedom and I felt like it was leverage and it's what I want. And so, you know, I talking, you know, and taking a path because I think his motives and M.O. is this, but it's really here. So just be honest, you're not the only one and I will tell you what this world would be screwed if it wasn't for the capitalistic types because they're the visionaries that actually change everything because they're honest about it and they understand psychology because they're honest about it and they're not trying to say one thing and be another. Let yourself be that way. Think about all the good that you're doing being just exactly as you are.
01:17:37 - Chona Sweet
By the way, when I say that I like the money that makes me feel bad, but at the same time, it makes me feel bad that I feel bad about it. I don't know if I added that. I want to have that mind shift of I want to make more money because I can see in Mark, but I can see in Dr. E. They have a different look in them. It's hard to articulate, but it's like, it's the business people in them like, oh, I'm doing it.
01:18:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
you ever read the book at this fund?
01:18:13 - Chona Sweet
No, what is that? You said, you said, at it, do you have the hand ran book?
01:18:24 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yes. Let me ask you a question then before we finish, because you were with so many people in all different stations in business from startups to very established businesses to people taking over for someone who and different education and class levels like, yeah, especially the ones who are just starting or have shifted, right? How often do you see it in a slingshot where there feels like they're running through the mud? feels like they're running through the mud hitting their head against the wall. So close to quitting and then just one. Hey, it feels like one day. It's not different in your way ahead.
01:19:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Almost every time, but I will tell you that there is one commonality between all of them, and that's consistency. I don't see it and people who don't show up consistently. I see those people fail and sabotage without exception. I have seen people hear me, acknowledge the truth, and show up consistently for the first time in their lives, really, for the hard things. I have seen that. I do believe it can happen, otherwise I would quit with people as soon as I see they don't show up regularly. It for sure is in there. And I would tell you what the litmus test is. had it tonight. It's talking about it. And when I ask you to not make excuses or anything, you're just like, okay, Most, anybody else that isn't going to do the work will still argue there. You didn't. So I have hope for you, but I will tell you that that catapult slingshot comes from consistency. So what you do is you build up tension. It's a compounding effect. And you have done all the things and it's almost like driving the driving lessons again. Only the difference is you're revving the engine right there and pretty soon you get to let off the gas and just go. And it in my favorite way of looking at that is a one year period. So for Mark, let's use Mark as an example. He is always the slingshot. He will just will be talking about talking about talking about things like Mark, when you're going to do this, when you're going to do this, let's just give up and stop bugging him for a little while or whatever. You'll be thinking about something and it just will piss him off and he'll just be like this driving he does I'm gonna go fix this and then he'll go into a deep dive and He'll find a solution and he'll fix it. I didn't do any of it. I'm a facilitator. Sometimes I'm a catalyst, but I don't really fix anything Sometimes I show the solution like chat GBT or cloud AI or something But really that's not the solution. It is the visionary It's the one is like, you know what what I could do and then they they get to work at it And he does that and the the pace of that is probably every several months that there's a slingshot type effect but there's one at least every year and What I was about to say was I like the Looking back over a year because I can always find a look at this Like look at this that happened to look at this that happened There's always if you think you can stack and go wow like we didn't have that last year That's pretty awesome and then it can also go I can look at some of the conversations that we had that ended up being the catalyst for that.
01:22:04 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
So, two months we did that today when we're looking at the year of, you know, we're signing things, we're looking at December and you see, like, go to the top, and then, like, pop. But it was constantly, like, running into a wall doing stuff. don't like to do repeatedly. Yes.
01:22:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know. don't like doing Like, you know what? You're right. I just got to do it, and you go do it, and it's amazing. And the growth, I mean, so sweet law, when we started, we were getting about 32, 30 retainers a month on average. And now, we're anywhere from, like, 82, we've had 100, over 100, or 100.
01:22:50 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah.
01:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Lorenz, we've been working with Lorenz for, it's been six months now, but his 30 days, we've taken his average. of closing the cases to 30 days in six months and considering Lorenz's normal pace is sloth. I mean it with respect.
01:23:10 - Chona Sweet
really like him. He's a big sloth. He's huge.
01:23:15 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
He just moves slowly. He's very just very slowly and that's not a knock on him. It's just how he is and that's okay. But what's he saying like he now knocked off 10% of what he's doing which means he will make more money. He will be less stressed out. But it took you three, four, five months to get him to that point.
01:23:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I actually started seeing the change in August when I was looking at the reports. It was very slow. It was about 10 days. So I would say about every two months there was a 10 day kind of shift and I didn't know how much confidence I felt in it like I was talking about today. I'm like I don't know how much of a difference it actually makes. But that's the thing perspective, personalities, body, these chemistry, childhood trauma, it all comes into the mix, which is why I take holistic approach to it and don't like take a Harvard business process to it.
01:24:12 - Chona Sweet
Just doing all that coffee is not good still.
01:24:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, but the thing is I love what I do and I didn't always and that changed everything. It changed how much I earned. It changed how much I earned per hour because that when I became more joyful in it, I had more energy to go study, to read more books, to hone my craft, to develop my systems a little bit better and bring them back to my people. If you spend more time in the hospital, less time in the places that are draining you, that could be a potential benefit that maybe you haven't thought about because you haven't had the perspective of, I give myself permission to build the business that I want to build, the way that I want to build it, knowing that I will go bless others if I build
01:25:00 - Chona Sweet
business that blesses me. Right and I actually love that part that yes wanted to make more money I want to see more patients because I get paid for patient but at the same time I as compared to how I was in the past I've been very much open and grateful to appreciation when patients express oh I want to like today I want to talk to the nurse practitioner who I talked to last month because I want to thank her that is me you talk to me and yeah no thank you the procedure that you recommended I did it and it worked my pain is over 70 percent better so again I have a patient the other day like I need your card because I want to make sure it's a hospital patient I want to make sure that they keep you I just had an epiphany because you're talking about you know the lean patients and it making you money but that's the hospital doesn't make you more money right?
01:26:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
doesn't I get paid stick would be real quick because we're going to close this up and I think Oh, I remember you telling me that what you liked about the oh actually maybe it's the other way around in the hospital you can give them the treatments that they need or is it in the clinic in the hospital it's quick instant relief and I tell I can see it the next day like today like multiple times I gave something or I did something and then they're much better the next day and they go home early that was it so part of what I think makes you happy is you actually get to help people feel better so yeah so but I want you to remember that that is a motivator for you or you wouldn't like the hospital so much right though you taking care of people is very important to you making them feel good and be better is very important to you it's okay that it's also true that making more money and not doing tedious charting is something that you
01:27:00 - Chona Sweet
I'd better.
01:27:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's okay for you to be nuanced and complicated. You're a woman.
01:27:07 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
But I don't remember any time you come home from the site hospital.
01:27:11 - Chona Sweet
No, I honestly don't know.
01:27:14 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
It's true that was thankful to you. Or that you saw this and the pain went away because of your recommendation.
01:27:21 - Chona Sweet
And in the last month, there's been four, five, six.
01:27:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really good column. That's really good column.
01:27:29 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
Money exactly the same. And you had to work a little bit harder with the hospital stuff, but you got that sense of joy.
01:27:37 - Chona Sweet
Yeah. No, the patient.
01:27:40 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
up with it.
01:27:41 - Chona Sweet
Even Tina, she saw you light up with it. It's a completely different change with you. Yeah.
01:27:46 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
you know, this bag, you get all excited.
01:27:50 - Chona Sweet
Well, the one who I talked to today is a phone call. Yes, it's longer. I talk to them every month. But patients light up if I give them their We feel which of narcotics, which is fine, whatever, but this is different when they say hey, know, you know, you really think you or, you know, I don't know.
01:28:11 - mark sweet (sweetlaw.com)
They've been trying to sell their pain and they've been trying to get someone to help them and you help them solve an issue that's been killing the sickle cell person talking about where watching it off, you spent time to figure out a solution that actually helped them.
01:28:22 - Chona Sweet
Yeah, whether the black patient because that's not neglected even there. Yeah, yeah, no, I have a, I have a little bit of a bias with sickle cell patients because I, it's a painful disease and they get very dependent to it and they were dubbed as seeking because their pain is not controlled.
01:28:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I just, why people don't understand it that's why I'm serious medicine and a lot of treatments where you'll find the greatest innovation is where the people with the money. have experienced it and so they've innovated in that particular area. It's not even a racist thing. That's just that that's just the reality.
01:29:09 - Chona Sweet
So anything. Yeah, no, it's true. That's why you know, not a lot of people like what I do. lot of people I talk to like, why are you in pain? Is this deal with the patients who are in pain and they're addicts and they're they're it's.
01:29:23 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My sister works in a methadone clinic.
01:29:24 - Chona Sweet
Did I tell you that? Yeah, you did told me not everyone not everyone likes to work even psych patients. And I have a, you know, I know, Marcus, it's very, very hard on me. I take in a lot of of it, but I feel bad for them. everyone wants to help them.
01:29:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's it's sad, you know, but that's all the more reason why that by the way, the skill of being able to sit in negative energy and not let it be taken in is a really important skill.
01:29:56 - Chona Sweet
Yeah.
01:29:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And it's not deflecting it. It's letting it be there, but not letting absorb and impact you, right?
01:30:05 - Chona Sweet
Right.
01:30:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's something that I can help you with. God put me through it from infancy. So that was a skill that I got to develop. But you have so much to give. I really want you to practice not judging yourself and just being able to speak openly about how you feel about things. Yeah. And ask, you know what, can this be done in a different way that I actually like? Yeah. And understanding that you liking something is not being petty or impetuous or anything like that. It's you managing energy. And with you having maximized energy, first of all, better quality life, better quality relationships, but also better quality service. Your brain works better. thoughts will be more creative. You'll be more powerful and potent in all ways. Right. need to justify making the way that you want to. It's because you'll bring better everything to every table.
01:31:04 - Chona Sweet
You go to right Yeah, I know like I always feel better when I talk to you I'm glad because I did so much.
01:31:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know she's gonna like me tonight, but I know I do and again, I Appreciate the nudge.
01:31:20 - Chona Sweet
I appreciate them honesty because it's what I needed, you know when I need it I know I'm not I know I there's a lot of things I need to do it's just a matter of me.
01:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's you baby wanting to do it.
01:31:32 - Chona Sweet
I don't I don't pay anybody to tell me what I need Well, we do all need to go because we need to be And get a clock so we have woman to get dressed in chains. Thank you so much.

## Quote 28

> 00:00:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good to see both of you guys.
00:00:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How are you guys doing?
00:00:27 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
How are you?
00:00:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. Sleepy.
00:00:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Actually, I'm running for nap.
00:00:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's the time. Yeah, I'm glad we were able to connect today. And Lorenz has been like a year since I've spoken to you, huh?
00:00:46 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yeah, last time we spoke with Sam.
00:00:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, how are you feeling about your numbers? Well, let's see. I have so many questions, actually. They all fight in my brain and want to come out at the same time. so usually I just trip over them and eventually something comes up. Yeah, so let's see, I'm curious about your numbers, although I've been looking at them because I look at them every week with Mark on a whole, not always individually. And I know we have talked about Cynthia and how she works, but now she's on Pat's team, right? Yeah. So let's start with just kind of a recap of what you remember about what we discussed last year. And anything that it's, I don't know that you might have kind of applied or feel like forgot, didn't apply, whatever, your overall thoughts from your experience last year to now.
00:01:55 - Lorenz Schuerch
Sure. So I think my real life things is, you know, trying to, I think, struggling managing individual members on the team. And we were working on trying to find everyone's strengths. We can't play to their strengths at the time. And so I've been trying to do that and not apply like a preset system on everybody equally. So I'm using everyone's strengths. You know, I split my, I have two teams, essentially. I have Jessica and Mike and John and Viri. And they, it's the same task. All the same tasks get done. the division of the task is a little bit different from one team to another based on their strengths.
00:02:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. And how do you feel like that works for you? What do you notice about? just day-to-day operations. It could be in terms of cohesion on the team, how people feel like just kind of mood, satisfaction, their own satisfaction. There are so many different nuances to how we perform operations that impact us as people, but also as output. How do you feel like that works for your team?
00:03:34 - Lorenz Schuerch
I think they like the general idea. think the issue that we run into a lot is we have these goals and all five of us are very goal oriented, like knowing the expectations and so we all kind of sit down at the beginning of the month, go through the cases we'd like to set, all cases we'd like to close. And then invariably there's always, you know, it's like every day there's like crises that take away our time. And you know, there's clients that are just about to fire you because I never get a call back and I look into the case and, you know, we're talking to that person every other day. And so it's, you know, it's on some of us a little frustrating because it feels like, you know, the biggest, uh, variables that client themselves.
00:04:34 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. Um, so that's interesting too. Let me end that.
00:04:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Right. Like today I spent an hour with a client who, uh, you know, wasn't happy with her conversation with Mike yesterday and I basically said, well, she had a list of questions. And I went through all of her questions one by one and essentially said the exact. same thing Mike told her yesterday, but she was super happy. And, you know, she loves us now. But yeah, to take an hour out of my time out of the things I had to set out to do today, to talk to her and repeat the exact same thing Mike told her yesterday.
00:05:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hey, um, that's good information. So I'm going to just kind of recap that the way that it's, well, and we only got to talk once and we've only talked once. We'll around you and I twice, but there was one as a startup and then just a follow up. But so Mark has committed to six months to work together for the three of us. And what I do with my clients is basically just take a holistic approach. So it's a lot of information gathering. And then it's a matter of prioritizing and ranking what we discuss and what we'll have the biggest impact. what's the biggest lover in the business in your day to day operations and things like that. So though we're just starting kind of working together, I've been with Sweet Law for three years. So we've been talking, you know, Mark and I every week for the last three years. And so some of the things that we're working on is going to kind of and overlap. So one of the things that we were talking about trying to figure out is how do we do, how do we create a client ranking system with intake so that we can improve our intake script and process to potentially if even possible because there's such a wide variety of types of cases that you take as well as types of people. And we can't, you know, just cherry pick everything, right? But, but are there ways of determining through potentially profiling and through recognizing through conversation very early through the script, what types of people are going to show up are going to do the work, you know, because there's always a portion where they've got to get us their information and, and do the reporting, will they return our phone calls, will they return our emails, all of those types of things. And so, anyway, not that we have enough information do any of that now, but, but, but all of the things that you share will be useful because then I can go back and we can look at and you guys might find that there are some parallels in what you experience. And one of you might say, well, actually we had that same issue and this is how we did it. So, there's a couple of things just as a general practice that I try to do. with all clients across all business types and it doesn't work uniformly and sometimes it's just not applicable but for example starting up the day proactively versus reactively meaning whatever planning we're doing whatever organizing we're doing and whatever we've prioritized as being the most important thing to accomplish those things get done beginning of the day as quickly as possible so that when we get pulled to the fires you know the things that have to be dealt with in a timely manner have to take time the things that were most important the things that moved the needle the furthest let's say it's a really high high level case right maybe it's a death case and and there's it's higher priority because of the client because of the client's needs and the impact it has in their lives but also what it's worth to sweet-law so What we'll try to figure out is are there ways that we can better structure either our day or the team or our styles of communication with customers or within the team where we have more time and more energy for higher value, higher impact activities, and we're either triaging the lower level stuff. Potentially delegating it. There's a lot of variety. You know how you manage a team, but those are the things that we're going to be looking at, seeing if there's things that we can do to improve. We'll take best practices and then I'll also take some of this information back to Mark and see if there's some feedback where he can help. So point being all of this is discovery. All of this is useful. And that's kind of I just wanted to talk about the approach of how we're going to be doing it since we haven't covered that yet you and I learned and Pat and I did that last week so just make sure this isn't a child it's not in mute everything sorry about that. Okay, so you were talking about. So how many people do you have on your team and I'll have your list right now. I've got four. And remind me who they are please.
00:10:33 - Lorenz Schuerch
So there's Jessica and Mike. And then there's John and Mary.
00:10:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Jessica and Mike are your case managers.
00:10:42 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, John is a case manager. So they're split into two teams. So Jessica and Mike do mostly the Spanish speakers. And then John. And they're both case managers and then. and John and Vary have more of a traditional split where John does most of the case manager asks and Vary does more of a record request and things like that.
00:11:19 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And those two were kind of a pair, weren't they, that are newer to the team? Very, didn't she come from somewhere else?
00:11:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, she came, I think she came from Sweet James maybe, I'm not sure.
00:11:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was thinking not, but did she and John work together before? No. It wasn't them, okay.
00:11:45 - Lorenz Schuerch
But Mike and Justin.
00:11:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mike and Justin, okay. I knew that there was a newer two people that had worked together and kind of came together. Okay. So how do you, when do you have your meetings, how do you meet set your goals like as a weekly, do you have daily meetings, how do you look?
00:12:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
So right now we went through a few iterations and I try to get as much feedback as I get from them. We used to meet as a full team every other day and then the feedback I got was that there's a lot of, when we were going through cases for the other team, the opposite team didn't feel like there's a lot of value so now I'm meeting with individual teams every other day and we kind of do file reviews. We do, you know, if there's any fires to put out, we do those and then we kind of cases along.
00:12:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And how long have you been
00:13:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
doing it that way about a month and how do you feel that's going for you it's going good I'm yeah I think I like the idea of doing foul reviews as a team it seems like we're all on the same page at the same time rather than information you know trickling in from different slack channels and we we have a better overall trajectory for each case what what's next you know how do we move this case along faster and you've only been doing this for a month but you you notice the trajectory changing and improving yeah yeah and we have a lot less a lot fewer cases while stagnating
00:14:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that was primarily, would you say, from, um, the file reviews together?
00:14:10 - Lorenz Schuerch
So all five of you doing that? Well, no, because their cases are split up. So like now I do, I do them with the, I do the, okay.
00:14:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So file rules together per team.
00:14:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
So team.
00:14:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, that's great. I'm, I'm really interested to see how that continues to improve, are you getting good feedback from them?
00:14:38 - Lorenz Schuerch
They like that. Oh, they love it. They, I've gotten really good feedback from all four of them. They say they, this is the, the best thing. just. Let's go. Leader.
00:14:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
job.
00:14:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
Good job. It took some. Several iterations.
00:14:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
As I said. Yeah. That's the thing about growth, though, it does. It takes several. Okay. Good iterations and you know there are different things that can throw a wrench in it just somebody having a major life event can do it um you know there's there's so many different things because at the end of the day it's just it's people and um we've got a lot going on so um let me keep an eye on the time because I want to make sure we we cover everything I'm really I'm really excited for that so you do you remember reading the book multipliers that we talked about yeah um do you feel like you are staying mindful of um looking for ways to kind of nurture and develop leadership in each of your team members I could be better I could I could do better I used to I used to make time to have like an individual kind of like check
00:16:00 - Lorenz Schuerch
with each cheating team member like once a month and then you know people get sick they took some days off and it just kind of fell out you know a few months ago and to get back on the board especially with a new member very she's super super shy and so that's really hard to get it's like pulling teeth trying to get information out of her.
00:16:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Do you feel like that's her all the time or that it's a work situation and she maybe doesn't feel safe in in the work environment to speak her mind?
00:16:44 - Lorenz Schuerch
Not necessarily because you've created that but I see what you're saying you know it's hard for me to say at a distance I know that you know I I know she's a single mom with four kids, so I've always tried to, anytime she has a doctor's appointment or something like that, I to be as accommodating as possible.
00:17:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can relate.
00:17:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
Single mom.
00:17:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:17:15 - Lorenz Schuerch
And so I don't think I've ever said, no, you can't take time off or anything like that.
00:17:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, so as a single mom with four kids, sometimes just risk aversion keeps you from talking. Being afraid of stirring the pot a little bit, causing any kind of conflict, causing any kind of work environment hostility. you say things, you know what I mean? don't rock the boat kind of thing, which is why I was asking you, did you feel like it was more of her personality to not be open and say what she's thinking? Or is it that she's a single mom who can't afford to lose her job? and wants to have a good place to work. So she doesn't rock the boat and saying.
00:18:04 - Lorenz Schuerch
think there could be some of that. And I have four kids, so I kind of get it too a little bit, maybe not to the same extent, but, you know, you want stability when you have kids. You're not looking to job hop. So it's abilities, your primary motivator. And so I think there's some of that. I think there's, you know, it's easy to feel when there's not a ton of parents around you. It's easy to feel like you're not sure if people are gonna understand your needs.
00:18:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Okay, so I'm gonna make a note of just something that maybe we can work on some exercises that we can at least experiment and see if it's something that we can, we can. help with because I look at this as most of us don't want to be job-hopping. Most of us would like to kind of have a place where we can nurture and grow and evolve ourselves as well as everyone around us for a long time. And if that's the case, then it's worth investing in every portion of that experience in terms of the skills, including the soft skills, the communication skills, including the relationships between the team members, all of those things. so being able to tap into each person's super powers, their strength, everything that they have inside of their minds, to the point of like what you read in multipliers. Pat, did we talk about multipliers last week at all?
00:19:53 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
you remember? Yeah, I told you I didn't like to read.
00:19:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. we'll have an approach. But the promise of the book was, and I think I did touch this, which is that you want to nurture the leadership in everybody that's on your team, so that basically everybody's playing at their best levels, and that you can create autonomy. Like you were talking about Cynthia, you needed to walk her through some things so that she would know just to get the job done, right? These are the things that don't sit around and wait to be told that type of thing. Like that's multiplying, that's making her more valuable, and there were things that Lorenz did as well to work with her. So that's just the thing is noticing where somebody might be pulling punches a little bit, might be holding back a little bit, or somebody might just not be having the support that they need to be able to to do what they can do. So as we go through our meetings each week, it's just kind of looking and going, oh, I noticed this thing. And some of it is just going to be human nature. None of us are perfect. None of us are going to do amazing at all the things all the time. But some of the things we can make, even if it's a 1% improvement, a 5% improvement, sometimes a 15% improvement. And then you start compounding 1% over here, 5% here, 10% here, another 1 over here. And then all of these different improvements, of them micro level, some of them macro level. And then you look at that a year later, and you look backwards and go, wow, this is amazing. Look at how steady we are at these numbers. Look at how happy everyone is. Look at how well everyone's working together. I used to have to say this to somebody every single week. now I really don't know. I'm to have to say anything to them about it, like little things like that, that just make the quality of your work day better, a little bit less stressed, not just for you, but for your teammates, which tends to end up coming out for the clients, which makes their experience a little bit better, generally will impact the numbers so that your bottom line revenue is higher without feeling more stressed because of it. So, they're very subtle things. There's nothing that you go, holy cow, that's an amazing whiz-bang like, you know, did that come from? It's nothing like that. It's just a little micro adjustment here and there that you look back at it and go, this is better. For example, around your goal last year to start improving your numbers, how are they compared to where you were at the beginning of 2023 versus now?
00:22:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
What's that like for you? I've been trying to work on... I'm quicker turnaround. think I had a couple of first quarter. I had a couple of rough months. One was kind of rough because of money in and then the following one was rough because of settlements, which doesn't make sense. You would think it'd be the other way around. that took a big chunk out of my confidence. I kind of like try to reset myself, reset the team expectations and try to press on the gas pedal. The numbers could be my goal every month as a minimum. of $600,000 and I haven't hit that in a couple of months, so I've been just disappointed. And then there's a couple of factors as of looking at that and State Farm has been just really awful to deal with this year. putting the brakes on everything I've got. Probably out of the 20 cases I have in negotiations right now. 10 of them are State Farm and they're offering less than meds. mean, I don't know about you Patrick, but they're just, they seem to be just slowing everything down, just gumming up the words. And it, it's just, it takes so much time.
00:24:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you noticed anything that sounds out about State Farm for you?
00:24:52 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yep. Same compliance as like the cases. Those cases take the most time to get resolved and it's like, and it's crappy results. Yeah, like the, to the firm, it's like the lowest result of like, sometimes I'm like, it's better. We don't even just drop the case and I'd rather put more time into X case that's going to bring in 30K to the firm because, I mean, I just resolved one now. It's like the case settled for nine grand. We're going to take like two, like, I spent so many time just trying to reach somebody there. Clients pissed off because it took so long and the numbers like not even anything, you know, you would think somebody was going to wait five months for a case in negotiation would be getting like at least 10 to 12K in their pocket.
00:25:40 - Lorenz Schuerch
It's to the point where, when I see in the intake channel that the defendant's insurance estate farm, I get anxiety and I'm like, if it's not a broken bone, I don't really want it. Because I know it's just going to be such a struggle.
00:25:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That is really. really good to know. don't know ethically that we'll want to avoid those, but maybe, you know, because we talked about client ranking, but maybe there's a case ranking system that we have. And maybe, I don't know, I want to talk and brainstorm this with Mark and see if there's a different way that we handle it. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:26:31 - Lorenz Schuerch
Because I look, the main issue and Patrick talked about is it takes just as long to manage a small soft tissue case as, you know, for a state farm as it does to manage something a little bit more serious for GEICO, for example. But the state farm case, I know if I get the meds, it's like party time, we've we've won kind of thing where with GEICO, we can pop the policies
00:27:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
All day long It's also hard to game plan those state farm cases because even if you do all the right things like that mark has taught us on how to work up a case It like that just doesn't apply what state farm for some reason. I know the friends has cases where you know even The client got injections in the medical You know the offers like not even half the medical expenses like it just doesn't make sense And that's a case that you work up just like any other case would and you know The other one settles and gets done and this one you're still stuck like asking the most basic questions to the adjuster like why is your offer X amount and you get like Seven eight of the state farm cases now You know based on marks the stuff he sees this case It doesn't have any negotiations for X amount of months. The client's pissed off. It just snowballed into the time sucking machine. And then when it does get resolved, it's not even worth half the time that we spent on it. But to completely bar every state farm case from coming into the firm, I don't know if that's the right move.
00:28:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't think it would be practical. We can't lose that many, but we might be able to change the way that we process them. And I don't know, like, even maybe a team or a system dedicated to it, or just even just having an awareness. There sometimes there might be a conversation that Mark can have. Maybe there's a representative. I don't know, but...
00:29:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
It starts with having awareness.
00:29:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Has there even been a conversation among the attorney is or with Mark that state farm stands out so badly?
00:29:09 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Yeah, every week, every week.
00:29:12 - Lorenz Schuerch
I can bring it up every week.
00:29:14 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What does he say about it?
00:29:16 - Lorenz Schuerch
He says, well, it's you know, you can always have someone else second voice and things like that. I've had other people second voices. had Patrick second voice. I've had Sam, I've had Nick. And usually it results in an additional thousand bucks. And it's I'm not going to like bulk at that because I know if we get enough extra thousand dollars eventually builds up or whatever. So go ahead, sorry. And I feel like. Like where's my value as an attorney to the client?
00:29:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:29:58 - Lorenz Schuerch
If I'm getting them. the meds paid for, basically.
00:30:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, well, at the very least, one thing I wanna do, and I don't think it's in our, I don't know if it's in our reports, it's not on my dashboard, but I would like to see matters by insurance companies and look at what the volume is across insurance companies in terms of how many cases we get how many times we hit max policy limits. Just drill down on that a little bit more. We'll be interesting. And sometimes, so to the point of getting disheartened, sometimes you just have to put things in perspective and just say, is it, and not let it get to you. pause, you know, there's there's all kinds of science on the psychology when you just you focus on on the problems, especially the things that you can't control, it impacts the rest of your mood, it impacts your energy, it's going to impact your cognitive abilities, simply because your mind is over here wrestling the frustration.
00:31:24 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, but the metric that we're measured by is our average fee.
00:31:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right, I get that and so but here so so this is part of why I want to have the report so I can look at statistically if everybody is averaging roughly the same amount of state farm cases so then we would look at is there any possible way and I doubt it that somehow intake is you know one team gets more of that and one team doesn't it's not very likely that that's the case. So that means that if everybody's getting right roughly, and throughout the year, it probably is. The same amount of state farm cases, then it really is not a determining factor, right? Because you would all be dealing with the same problem. And so, if Samantha, so I'm looking, I asked Mark this and I did not get the question, but you guys get to see each other's numbers, right? You know what everybody's attorney fees are, roughly. so I'm going to look at this for this year. Let me update it. So, Lorenz, for the year of 2024, your average attorney fee is 11,000. We're not going to look at Mark or Nick, because obvious reasons. Pat, you're at 8.8k, Sam's at 17k, Tyler's at 11k. So, you and Tyler are tied Lorenz. If I look at that for last month for June, which is a very small pool and not really a good way to look at it, for last month your 8.4k, Sam was 12k, Tyler was 9.3k, Pat, your 7.6k. A month is, I mean, it's not a good sample size because of how long your cases take to work up and to settle. And let me look at record counts. So, wait, that was last month. wanted to do this for the year. So, cases closed by team for this year. Lorenz 125 for you. Pat, you're at 59. is a 120, so learns you close more cases. Again, how long they start is not necessarily a good thing. Just a second, please. have a child. Teenagers, and I work from home, so like, thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Okay, so, click cases close by team. Lorenz, 125, is for 2024, Pat, 59, 120, then, that number's 100% not correct, gross the, oh, that's by state, I'm fine. Resolution by team. My average attorney, we already did that. Dropouts and subouts. Lorenz, your percentage of subouts. Let's see, subouts as they fired you or is that dropped out?
00:35:23 - Lorenz Schuerch
Well, subout is when they hired different attorneys.
00:35:28 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
difference I guess. So, your percentage is rough. That can't be right. Hold on. Let me make sure this year. I'm not positive. Okay, okay. I need to change this report because I want to see it per all the cases that you have. But for the year, you only had five subouts. Samantha had 13. Pat had... three. Tyler had seven. Now, there's a lot of reasons that can happen. It can be your performance. It could be the insurance. It could be multiple things. And they're blaming us for it, not necessarily because of something you and your team have done. But there's a lot of things to look at in terms of your quality and performance and how you do the job. It isn't just attorney fees. That is what your incentive pay is. But all of these things impact sweet lot. Getting subbed out. And I can't so one on sub out. And one out. Percentage for cases. And policy limit for that case, potential loss, because I think that we should be measuring the loss for team two. And then this isn't about penalizing anyone. It's about making sure that we're evaluating everything. So, let's say that your attorney fees are lower, first of all, you're operating primarily in Arizona, and I don't know. All of you are, so Samantha waved into, I don't remember New Mexico, I think she's New Mexico. Who's doing Texas, do you remember? Tyler. Tyler. Tyler. So, you know, there's different things impacting your numbers, and all of that needs to be taken into account. So, at the end of the day, Really, the thing is we want to look at each of those numbers, just your attorney fees, but we want to look at the sub-out rate. We want to look at policy limits. We want to look at how often is your team showing up and doing well, how happy are they because that has an impact on the likelihood that we're going to have to replace somebody soon. We have to replace somebody because the pod leader, the attorney, is burning people out. It's very difficult to find good people to hire. We are constantly looking and we go through a lot just to find one new attorney. So, again, my approach is holistic. I'm looking at everything in Sweetlock top to bottom, never just the bottom line. I'm looking at each individual, I'm looking at them as a person. I'm looking at all the costs, all the impact. act, all the wins, all the losses, and and how it affects everything because ultimately each of these things makes an impact on how profitable it is, including how happy everybody is. So if you learn to measure all the things that matter, not just your attorney fees, but like I think you should be happy with the fact that your subout rate is so low, I think that that's important. I think that that means that you're probably doing something good. However, what I don't have and what I need and why I need to change this report is I don't have that in relationship to how many cases you had this year. So Samantha, if she, so her subout rate is more than double yours, but if her case rate is more than double yours, then she's roughly in the same boat, you know what I but. Yeah, so anyway, those are some of the things to look at, Pat, you're coming up and now you've got those goals, trying to, so I'm just going to tell you Lorenz, Pat's gone in for being the best attorney in the firm, so we've got some competition in here, but I think it's good, I think it's good. I think how we handle the competition, like Samantha, she's leading in attorney fees, but when Pat asks her questions, she answers them, and thoroughly, really supportive in answering that. And so ultimately, if all of our goal is, how do we make the sweet law be the best place to work, the best place to go for help? Well, you know, I think that's winning, right? job security is, if you show up and you're continually improving, maybe you're not improving an attorney fees for... or three months. But maybe what you did was improve your team processes. You improved. You made sweet lot better. And that's important. So we're going to have those conversations too. And also going to take that and report back to Mark, like the fact that you figured out through multiple iterations and different processes and effort and communicating with your team that your trajectory improved because you split the teams instead of having people sitting around, wasting their time on meetings that are irrelevant to them, doing bio reviews per your groups. That's important. Sweet lot was improved because of that effort. So maybe it doesn't have an immediate impact on the attorney fees, but it will over time, 100%. There's no way that's not going to. And if we get to continue working together, so here's the other thing.
00:41:56 - Lorenz Schuerch
Q1 here. Yeah, I guess I might. I am competitive, but I'm more competitive with myself, so always compared to myself to one career.
00:42:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's best way to be, honestly, because that's the only race you can run, but I like both of them. I think ultimately that's the only race you can control and that you're really actually in, but with Pat, know, wanting to get the highest numbers, like I get that too. The bottom line is whatever motivates us, that's what we need to tap into. That's what we need to be working with. So what everybody has different drivers, and as long as there's intrinsic motivation and drive, that's all we need. There are people that don't have it. They're only externally motivated to please other people, to get accolades, to earn money, but mostly so they can show up things, not because they want to improve themselves, not because they actually want to be the best at anything they just want to be. he perceived as the best. Pat wants to be good at what he does. You want to be good at what you do. And that's valuable. But I want to make sure that you did hear me. All of Sweet Law is slow and Q1.
00:43:13 - Lorenz Schuerch
Did you know that? No.
00:43:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every year, I've watched it. Every year, every year, have a little bit of a freakout period. Mark has a little bit of a freakout period. And then everything turns around and we're like, oh yeah, this is a pattern. But I will tell you that Mark didn't know it was a pattern because Mark didn't track his numbers. And when I would ask him for his numbers, he would say, well, I think it's this. And I think it's that. And I said, none of what you say adds up. So how about we go get that information? Yeah, but it's a pain in the . don't know how to get it.
00:43:51 - Lorenz Schuerch
And like, well, let's figure that out, Mark.
00:43:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so we did. And so now we've got some data and the more that we dig into it. Um, so we'll go get some information and all of a sudden, you know, nothing's really happening and then Mark sends an email because he can't sleep a night because he was thinking about something and he had an epiphany and he dug into some numbers and he's like, I just realized this. And then we have a big change and there's a big improvement and so really digging into all of these different numbers makes a difference. But something that I really love about numbers is it kind of takes the emotions out of it and in a good way. Um, because you see what's real numbers don't lie. Numbers tell you the truth. So if you see some good numbers, what do you know? You know that that's, that's a real thing. That's a good thing. If you see a number you don't like, it's also a real thing, but that's an opportunity to improve. And iteration upon iteration changes happen and occur. So, that's what we're looking at. So one thing I'm really excited about though by talking to you guys as I'm realizing how we can improve our reporting which is going to be really useful for us and what we're doing with Mark which will somehow come back and improve things for you including potentially improve because I don't know that we have the best incentive program that there is I want to make sure that you guys are incentivized for all the good work that you do including if we're minimizing dropouts and subouts I think that that should be part of it. Especially if the reason that we're getting subbed out is lack of communication and so this was something that really isn't managed super well I think across any team. I think it's getting better but we would have some cases where nobody been communicated with for two and a half months which is not acceptable and until I I was asking questions and probing and digging into that. That was just like that and it was unknown. So there's always opportunity to improve. And just by having the conversations, we figure out ways to, because you guys have a lot of watch, you have a lot of things to manage, you have a lot of people, a lot of processes, a lot of conversations that will fry the average person's brain every day. So dropping the ball is kind of part of the job, it's going to happen. we're trying to do is create the systems that minimize ball dropping. know what I mean? That also maximize making sure that we're spending the most time on the most important things, the highest leveraged impact type thing. And that we're making air pre-person on the team as potent as possible so that everybody's winning. So, um, okay, we've got about 15 minutes left and then Lorenz, um, before I forget, let's just go ahead and get out next week's schedule because next week will be just you and me.
00:47:21 - Lorenz Schuerch
Yeah, I thought we said next Wednesday, same time.
00:47:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Did we? Okay, uh, that will work. Let me just, I think I just didn't schedule it yet. Let me duplicate this. What is the calendar? No, that's not it. That will work. That will work. You don't have to deal with All right. Okay, so that's done. So Pat, Mr. Patrick, um, have you had any thoughts since our conversation last week?
00:48:11 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
The main thing that stood out was like the male, female dynamic. Um, it was obviously two of my team members or females. Um, we kind of touched on like how the male dynamic can help them like a camera with what you said. But like, I remember you talked about the dynamic between male and female team. Um, I want to see how I can use that to maximize. Um, because the team is super respectful. Um, you know, we don't have any issues. Sometimes I feel like there might be issues with the female case manager and answering to a male attorney, I'm not sure why, but that was like the main thing that really stood out. So I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on like naturally what's the dynamic like.
00:49:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So just even observing dynamics between people, there are going to be different things, the female female dynamic, especially if they're super strong, A type personalities in the workforce can be very either they're going to be very supportive of each other or tear each other apart. There's not a lot of middle ground generally speaking. So the first thing is just observing what kind of dynamics exist. Who do do two people interact with each other and seem to be more open when they interact with each other versus interacting with other people? Do you notice any tension? Do you notice more forthcoming, more holding back? type of thing. What I was saying about you is that you have a, so the way that you approach Cynthia, I think Lorenz is the same type of way, is that he wants to bring out the best in people. You want to support them. That doesn't exist everywhere with every person. Not every female comes to work and feels safe, either because of anybody that work or one. And men of the, you know, not necessarily safe, but it impacts, it'll show up in a woman a little bit differently in terms of how much she will lead and share what she knows is gonna help things. So one of the things that I do and have done for several CEOs is higher higher. and install a right hand person for them, more than an assistant, somebody who kind of like pushes back on them a little bit and says, did you think about this? Hey, I noticed you said you were going to do this, but you're not doing this. That type of thing, right? Now, that was what they were hired for. That was their exact role. That was what was wanted from the CEO, somebody to push back little bit and hold them accountable because there's nobody doing that in the business. And we all need somebody to hold us accountable. But without fail, even though that person was told clearly, please call out when you see issues, please call that out every single time as often as possible. And even when they did that and they never got pushed back, even when they were fully respected every time, it took years for them to feel safe enough to do the job well. Because generally speaking, That's not how the rest of the world operates. Most people don't want to be how accountable. Most people don't want to be called out even respectfully. There's ego involved, right? You both come off to me as someone who is not operating from a you're coming off a little harsh or something like that. But more importantly, the energy that comes from that is that you're safe to be around. You care about the people that work for you and work with you. Here's how I knew that from you, Pat. Without being prompted, you were talking about how you noticed Cynthia was not doing X, Y, don't remember all the details of it, but I remember you're like, I tried to give her space so that she could just do her thing and not, you know, control her basically. But you noticed that. that wasn't working. And so you knew that she needed more support, she needed guidance, she needed to be directed. And so you did that. But what you told me was I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I didn't want to, you know, cause her any problems or make her uncomfortable. So I just took my time and this is the approach that I took. So you showed that you were concerned with how she felt and that you took the time to modify the way that you showed up in order to create a safe space for her. I'm going to tell you, and Lorenz, I think that you would do the same kind of thing. I think that that's how you operate primarily is being concerned with giving people what they want. And you've given other signals like that, same thing with Cynthia, noticing that she's process oriented and everybody else is kind of free. so you gave her some tasks to allow her to create those processes. also when your team told you, look, we don't like wasting our time, like, okay, let's make a modification split this and I'll just go ahead and do two file reviews even though maybe it's more tedious for you, you were there to lead your people the way that they wanted to be led. What I'm trying to explain to you guys and what I really want you to hear, and this is not a platitude or patronizing or anything, that is not how most leaders operate. Most people are more bosses, they're not leaders. You both show up as leaders because you care about how the people that work for you feel you want them to be happy and successful and even if it's not altruistic, even if the only reason you're doing that was because then they'll perform better for you and you get better paid. Let's say that was all it was and I know that it's not. It still gets the same end result, they're still taking care of. So paying attention to how people respond to you. I'm noticing, for example, if Viri doesn't maybe answer questions if you ask her how things are going. want to drill into that with you next week a little bit more Lorenz and get the details so that maybe I can kind of figure out what's going on a little bit and we can find a way for that. But generally speaking, that's going to be that she's received signals from other bosses or leaders that have said, you know, if you tell me too much, it's going to annoy me and I'm going to give you some annoyed energy and you're going to feel that tension and that hostility and she has taken that and gone, you know what, I'm going show up, I'm going do my job, I'm going to go home and that's it. And I'm not going to rock the boat because I don't want to deal with feeling threatened with my job or anything like that. So, um, paying attention to these types of things, being aware of them, and also paying So guys, what I want you to understand is knowing how unique you are, that you have an opportunity to really improve, especially when you have females working on your team. Because you are safe, because you do care, you can probably get better performance out of them than they've ever had before. But if you want to know the impact that it makes, and maybe this doesn't motivate you, but I'll tell you this anyway, you can help them show up better in the rest of their lives completely by showing them that there are safe people in the world where they can make mistakes, they can say the wrong thing, and they can still be okay. You know what I mean? Because if you have people willing to make mistakes out loud, then the mistakes can be seen in the open, which means they can be corrected gently, but they can be corrected. Whereas if you have people who feel like they need to cover up their mistakes. Who need to lie about them or just not show you, you know, what's weak within them? You can't correct it. You can't improve it. Does does any of this make sense? Yeah, absolutely so I'll give you an example of where I learned and then we can kind of close it and I was inquire for like ever and and We would be learning new songs and they were difficult songs and my my Quaritage was always trying to get us to sing louder and So he could hear so he could pick out the part so he could see like he's I could hear there's an off note But I don't know where it's coming from because every time I walk by everybody's mumbling and they're not really right So I'm just like, you know what I'm sure you can imagine I was loud I Don't do quite or settle very well, but um, so I did that and it was frustrating because I would get corrected but I would get corrected quick and you know what happened after that, I nailed the part and then I'd be a section leader and everybody would start listening to me. So when I would join in any other choirs, church choirs, whatever adult activities and every other thing, I'll just be loud. I'll just make my mistakes out loud. I have opinions, I'm very secure in my opinions and loud about them when I say them and confident in them, knowing that if I'm wrong, somebody's going to correct me and I will not like that, by the way, do not like being corrected. But I prefer being corrected to being wrong perpetually. Do you know what I mean? So I'm okay with being confidently wrong so that somebody who knows better can observe it and go, yeah, no, that's not right, Tina. This is actually what you need to do. So I try to create that kind of space for people that work with me. as well and encourage them, just go do things. If you make a mistake, we're going to figure it out together. But if I don't have to tell you and train you on every little thing because you're not afraid to try it, you're not afraid to problem solve, you're not afraid to explore, you're not afraid to go look for other solutions and implement them knowing it could cost us money, it could cost us time. But knowing that the end result is we're going to get more knowledge and we're going to have a deeper understanding of how these things work and you got it for yourself and you made yourself more valuable to me. But I'm paying you the same amount of money. Go learn, go explore, go figure some things out. But then when they do that, they start getting more brave and they want to explore more things and they want to try more things and they bring more things to the table and then they stay with me for years and I get to keep benefiting from this all because I was like, go ahead and make mistakes. Like it's powerful. But, you have to make it very clear that it's a safe place to make mistakes. It's a safe place to tell what you really think, as long as it's done respectfully. And if it's done disrespectfully, then you just correct it respectfully. But we're looking at this long term, your people evolving. And the other thing that I'll tell you is that these skills and these things, they'll help you as parents, if you're a coach, they'll help you as a friend, any other place you show up as a leader. When you learn how to create a safe space for people, but also help them be their most powerful selves, everything that you do, everywhere that you serve, everywhere that you show up and have any kind of interactions, improves because you will be one of the few places in the world where somebody is safe to show up and have some room to make mistakes. So that they can explore and. and learn. And it's, I think it's pretty awesome. I mean, I love watching people grow. love knowing that I had a little bit of a part of it. And the two of you have both demonstrated that you have that kind of interest and awareness and ability. And Pat, you've got a strong like shoulder spore things just kind of roll off you. Lorenz, I think you get a little bit more anxious and stressed out about it, but you still take it into you rather than putting it on them. And so, and if we can teach you how to let stuff roll off you a little bit better, that would be good. But at the end of the day, you both offer very unique things to your teams where there's a lot of potential and growth. And I think that Sweet Law is going to be, I think Sweet Law is blessed for having both of you. But if we can keep working on these things together, I'm looking at some awesome stuff coming down the road.
01:02:00 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
and some good numbers and of course you know you want to get that extra money and you've got those goals so we'll get to them too through the people that you're working with and just through day-to-day ops so um Pat before we wrap up so we were talking about dynamics beyond female dynamic and you said that's what you were thinking about do you have more questions do you have more thoughts like did you want to dig into that a little bit more now um i had another can i give you like another thing i was thinking yeah um how to keep them motivated because obviously like their cap on you know financial like improvement is kind of limited because just the nature like we have our licenses and we're attorneys and like your salary or whatever can just you know it's kind of like sky's the limit whereas with you you know, non-licens staff here, it's kind of like, there's kind of a ceiling, um, and I'm sure they know that, but they, which is why I applaud and I appreciate all the work that they do, because I mean, Lorenz and I was like, they take a big blunt of the work that we don't want to do, you know, just even taking the calls every day, it's like, one day if Elsie's not here, and like, it kind of falls back on me, it's like, pay this woman what she needs to be paid to be happy and keep her here as long as possible, because like, you know, they really do a lot of the work that, you know, as an attorney at some point you want to negotiate and get the settlements, which is the fun part. So just like trying to keep them motivated and happy to be coming to work every day, because like I said, they do a lot of the work and, you know, I don't know how much they make, but in obviously Lorenz and I have like the room to really grow whereas other staff members is kind of like a range because for me it was in that position like I don't know if I would have lasted as long as, know, people have doing the work that they do.
01:04:19 - Lorenz Schuerch
So what I've done with my team is I've made my growth commence written affairs so we have certain bonus ladders where if we bring in this much money that month I'll take money out of my paycheck to bonus the people that and then that way they feel just as invested in the success as I do.
01:04:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I love that. But I thought that that was that the incentive program, so I guess maybe I was just probably thinking about intake because I know intake. takes incentive is combined like there's no way to separate it because each of them can touch a case multiple times before it becomes a case and before it's turned over to you because I've been trying to figure out how do I create some separation so that we can really measure and reward according to effort because not everybody shows up the same and I think that it should be based off of effort and ability but I didn't realize that the pods were separate like that that the case managers and assistants don't get incentive pay is that correct like not unless you're too mean right so that's some questions that I have because I would like to see that be consistent across sweet law I think that that would be better for the company but we've not had this conversation would like to have that with Mark. So that was a good point, Pat.
01:06:03 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
will bring that up.
01:06:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
My staff hasn't complained about, hey, this is just something internally that I was. No, yeah, yeah. That's good. I'm glad you brought that up and I'm glad you're thinking about that because I would think the same thing. know, if you're incentivized and they're not like, there's obviously ceiling to how much you can ask for them when they don't get more for it. I, for sure, I'm motivated by incentives and if I'm not getting more for working harder, guess what I'm not going to do.
01:06:34 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
Like, don't go put that up for somewhere else that comes back. the end of the day, was not going to want to get paid more, know, but there's just one of those things I was thinking about because, you know, on those hard days, when you, you know, on by clients all days, it's like, I'm going to come to work the next day and then, you know, what's my financial future like, you know, whereas for me and Lorenz, you know, we can suck it up and, you know, get yelled at by clients, but you have a really good month and it's like, You know, this is why why I put up, you know, yeah, so just you know I want to make sure that For the long term the team is happy and you know despite their They've been like in certain range. They can have other things to look forward to and be happy about Well, that's like a couple hundred dollars incentive every month.
01:07:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know it's not very much that takes to Yeah People yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so that's good was there anything else?
01:07:31 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
I know I didn't answer that I've been to look into that I don't think so I think the The three of us on the calls would be helpful because I can get some more detail on how Lorenz you know organizers team and everything because I'm just free styling I see some stuff that Sam does Tyler does from Lorenz But obviously these are more in-depth calls so No, I'm excited.
01:08:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Good. I'm glad and I'm really glad that you said that because I wasn't sure how I want to structure this. I thought that one on one a month and then to all of us meetings a month would be best. So I think that that would be good. Still that way we can talk about your team specifically on an individual basis. So that's what the one on one call would be to really dive into the nuances of your specific people. And then twice a month, you could really just do some back and forth best practices digging into Sweet Long General.
01:08:36 - Lorenz Schuerch
So how do you feel about that Lorenz? Does that work for you? That's great. I'm always, I always want to grow. I always want to do better. So I'm happy to just follow your lead and hopefully settle off. A lot more cases and have happy teams.
01:08:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. I think, I mean, just the thing that you did with the file review, I'm really looking forward to seeing how that goes. Pat, your team is going to be growing eventually. mean, you're definitely gun, and I'm watching your line grow. So it's good. I think you guys are awesome. I'm so excited to be doing this. Thank you for spending some time with me and letting me come in and do this work with you guys. So Lorenz, I will meet with you next week. And then Pat and Lorenz will will reconvene, not next Wednesday, but the Monday after that at 3 p.m. Sounds good.
01:09:37 - Patrick Shahverdian (sweetlaw.com)
You send emails, right?
01:09:38 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Every time like we're about to have a meeting? Yeah, you should get a notification through Google. And I have it set by default to send multiple reminders. But I don't know that the multiple reminders go to you. So, starting a day or yesterday. So what I'll tell you. though is so in the beginning we didn't have a set time but we're going to so what you can do is once I set that recurring Monday meeting call which I'll do by next week at the latest because we're doing Wednesday next week what you can do is go into your calendar and set up your own reminders to be whatever frequency level you want but I have mine going one day before just to kind of remind me it's a thing I do with all of my meetings and then four hours before and 15 minutes before just so that I remember because I've got a lot going on so I need other reminders but if you need anything else if you want other kinds of reminders let me know I probably will start getting to some point where there's some follow-up questions that I'll ask through email just to make sure that we're on track but right now there's a lot of just downloading everything from you guys so we're not getting to that point yet uh yeah so any other questions did you fix your pool my daughter is working on it right now because i just work hard yang are you in california no i'm in northern southern cal southern organ i want to say northern california southern organ southern yeah look now why is it more again oh we're at beaverton oh that's much nicer i live in the hictown and i cannot wait to move i'll be moving though every single night because i like oh we're at um probably the scott still area it's either that or vegas but yeah stop still it's very nice yes i like it very much all right you guys well i hope you have an amazing fourth of july i hope you have a great weekend and i look for

painting so it's got my gosh you're so cute yeah yeah I just I even have a picture of me in the car we I painted an old Honda Civic in my parents garage right pink bold pink with oil based house paint and a paintbrush and put a big red vinyl sticker I got made on the sides saying pinky student painting I decided to pull pink to cover the first objection in a blue color town I was raised in of well can a woman really climb a ladder and paint the exterior of my home so I figured just go with that objection and shout to the world that yeah we are women pinky and we're pink I love that yeah yeah so I obviously saw a lot to continue but I was also realizing because you like frameworks and stuff I have a really good framework graphic that I did a while that I think you're gonna love figure out how to just model after that too and some of the stuff we're doing but basically When I sold my social media certification program, I kind of channeled some of the stuff I learned from all the business process of re-engineering and SAP consulting jobs that I did with computer sciences, all that stuff. So basically we made like a really good, say me, but Tommy got half of my ex-husband because he's, he was a consultant too, but we made this really good, what's that?
00:01:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was the voxer thing I just got was from you, I don't know why I just sent it again.
00:01:34 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Anyway, sorry. Oh, no, we're zeroes. So, social media, social certification methodology.
00:01:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I just remembered that I made that graphic when I was like, up late.
00:01:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I know it was really good, yeah, So, let me just share screen, I'm still looking for, I called it fast-track for social media, media, sort of methodology, and I, all the people that paid $2,000. to the course I got certified, I allowed them to use all of that and the white peppers I created and stuff. So I was realizing that like I gave a lot of good back then that I don't feel I'm elevating this time around that I definitely should. So that's what's good about doing this. Fast track. Let's see if this comes up. copy of Fast Track methodology. Do you see this? My social sales accelerator methodology is this?
00:02:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh my gosh it's beautiful.
00:02:29 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, so it was blues. I actually looked like I did for maybe my social sales thing because I just modified it. But the original one is through a loop. So let me see if that comes up. If not, it's in my other Gmail account because I had an old Gmail account that I was using. Oh, that's actually really social.
00:02:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the yellow and gray is the other combination that works really well and you can think of of Amazon. Amazon uses those colors. are some like, yes, yeah, yeah, gray brown, you know, UPS, brown, brown gold, but gold and blue and often they're used together, but those are powerful colors and the gray and black are kind of elite level, right? Which is why Amazon, I mean, in the beginning, um, and even so, they, they've got so much to them, Brown, but UPS, corporate, corporate kind of thing.
00:03:38 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So here it is. Like, this is the whole webinar presentation at the end of a challenge. I like someone coaching room and, you know, um, that was a review.
00:03:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
love to do a webinar together.
00:03:48 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
We have to get some offers and this is what we're working towards.
00:03:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yes. I was thinking about it last night and I was, you know, in my prayers and stuff and after, especially after you were consulting and I'm not consulting. I'm asking about the scaling question, I'm just talking to Heavenly Father and I'm like, know, because here's the thing, Maria, like, I'm not trying to build a legacy business, I never have my love is always like, can you protect your brand? got to this? I'm like, babe, this is not my calling forever. This is what I'm doing now, like, I'm, I'm running a book called the prosperity complex. And it talks about, and it's very much the same premise as give a man a fish versus feed a man. feed a manifesting, teach him how to fish, that kind of thing. But it's that you don't solve poverty by giving money. You don't solve poverty by redirecting money or donating or things like that. solve poverty by making self-provident people. And when my babies are grown, all I want to do is go visit my family and my friends, my loves. And I want to strengthen them and I want to teach them skills. I would love to go to Africa. I'd love to go to that any country even do it here, but teach people the same way that I serve my clients just every day people that would never have a chance to learn it because there are so many skills. We figured out lemonade stands where we're kids, know, and mowing lawns like kids can do it. So there are grown people who could completely change their communities if they have somebody just say, number one, you can do it. Here's how you can do it and here's the simplest way to do it because most people don't teach that part, right? that's what I want. So in the meantime, what I'm doing now, I just want to serve God through my people, through my kids, my business, by helping them do that right be self-provident. The money that I need to help people because I have to teach how to fish, but also feed fish until they can
00:06:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
learn, right?
00:06:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And so I've got that responsibility and the income that I need and want to generate. But I want to have joy in it and I want to bring joy in. I was just thinking in terms of that scalable, I still think that us spending our time with a few high level clients, and this is the diversification that I've been saying about from the beginning, right? that you don't have just one offer, you have a few offers, you have one that's like really high level that pays well but also gives you the experience of keeping your soft, super sharp and really understanding the businesses inside and out. also because it's a high level client, having higher level expansive mind expanding conversations, right? And then you take it back to the lower levels and just showing up in a community. and me teaching people, nurturing them, loving them and helping them make money. I'm like, that's so like joy for a few years while I finished raising my baby and we making plans with whatever extra money we're doing because one of the things I wanted to do is have my money work for me. And like I imagine the compounding effect of us working together for a few years if you were interested in it and building an off ramp where you do whatever you wanted to do because you've got the money that you do whatever you want to do you can do it because of purpose or and likewise and not that I would just like disappear because when I keep people I keep people forever so there's that but anyway I just thought how much joy would it be to just share community and serve them and love them and teach them the marketing and the business and but also to feed off of their thoughts it's not like we're there are going to be people that are smarter than us in some ways you know sorry did you say something?
00:08:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I had to say Alexa stop. had an alarm for an hour, but I already did it. It was to put the rice back in the fridge. Sometimes I pre-cook rice for dinner.
00:08:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I've gotten lazy and I buy the ones you can just steam in 90 seconds.
00:08:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I have those too. I have lots of those too, but I got a rice cooker.
00:08:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's kind of cool, so yeah. Oh, last night I threw a bunch in the Instant Pot, so it was brown rice chicken, broccoli, with some cream of chicken, and there's some Montreal chicken seasoning, and then some cheese in it.

Nice. Montreal chicken season.

I don't drink Well, this is what's funny cuz we don't drink much either This is why it's funny cuz I don't we're getting all this cuz we get booze for everyone and they're young and stuff and Literally we each had like one glass Saturday night and one glass of wine on Sunday one glass of wine lat yesterday So so we laughed at each other saying well, we got booze that'll last us till well into the new year because I my sister and I were talking about it cuz she drank too much
00:10:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the weekend and I was like, when I was 18, I got blackout drunk a couple of times and the fact that I could drink so much, probably also had some marijuana, but drink so much that I first of all, I thought my body was explode and I peed all over myself.
00:10:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So there was that.
00:10:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I didn't remember what I did and when I was told what I did and the way that I behaved was just rude. And I was like, I need to not, and I'm not, I don't do anything by halves. So if I'm on drink, I'm on. So religion or not, I just need to not be a drinker.
00:10:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, it's funny. Um, yeah. So, so it was, yeah, it was really good. So, so yeah. So, but when I, right, I almost like was going to vox you the few hours later saying, Oh, wait, no, disregard the message about these offers and scaling because I realized the first step is you need the pedigree and all my courses use that and then we'll figure out from there. so anyways, that's why. I backed off unboxing you because I'm like, oh, I got to get this done for you.
00:11:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
For us. Yeah. Because I really, what I think it's just going to do is make attracting people and make our marketing so much easier.
00:11:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:11:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
it's not just what you've accomplished, but it's your path of evolution. And so you're not just showing somebody that, look, this is where I am. And this is the success I have now. Like, I got here in steps because everybody has to get where they're going in steps. You don't leapfrog for the most part. So the other thing is I specifically for you is I think that you had forgotten how great you were. Like you knew it, but the details of it every time you would tell the story, you'd be like, I forgot that. And I had paid attention to the fact that you kept saying you forgot that. And so I wanted you to really remember, but also because you've attracted these people and they start to got a connection with you and low ticket and in their mind, maybe lower value, that needs to be corrected. The second part of it was what's your library of content, like what have you created because from that, and you have way more than me to bring to the table, as far as I'm concerned. Way more experience, in terms of volume, the thing that I think that I do the best is that mine has always been leveraged. My effective hourly rate has stayed high for a long time. I've worked very, very little and still done really, really well, but in terms of volume of clients, because I work so little, I don't have a vast experience and I didn't make as much money myself. So I have earned over a million dollars over a few years of coaching, which is you. But I'm less impressive, between your library and your pedigree, that will help convert people a lot. I'm more impressive when you talk to me, more impressive than you. mean, more impressive as a person, but I don't really feel like mine. There are some accomplishments that people go, wow, I think, but I think I just have less of them.
00:13:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, and the thing is what you'll find about all my stuff, you look at it all, that probably if I stuck to one of those, I would be in a far different position right now. Because I totally realized that, look at Amy Portafield, like she had, I remember when she first, like I used to be a search term on Google, like people, like I'm sorry on Facebook ads, you know, interest. So back in the day. So, so, and that was before Amy Portafield even existed. And then she came out with her podcast and all this stuff. And then she, but she stuck with it. Like, yeah, she had webinars that convert. That was her. first thing, but then she converted to Digital Course Academy, and she stuck with it. Like all this time, or look at Brooke Castillo, the life coach school, like she stuck with it. Yeah, she's going through whatever changes she's going through right now, but she like, so I think that was my biggest downfall because probably if I stuck with just the social media certification, because that social media is still hot now, then it was like years ago, but this whole webinar, after the challenge selling this, because you know, they even got a certificate.
00:14:32 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
This was back in 2000.
00:14:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Wow. Yeah, this back in 2011 for social media was huge. So I could have been like the, what's that other gal? The blonde here that wears the turquoise blue all the time.
00:14:46 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Mary, Mary, she's glazer.
00:14:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I like her too. No, she's the Facebook queen, Facebook loves her, and got her to speak a lot on the Facebook stages. Mary, I forget. Anyway, so I'll come to my mind, but But this whole thing took a hell of a lot of work to create.
00:15:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How do I have stesses, lot of testimonials.
00:15:06 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I think it was probably just because with divorcing Rudy and everything since I felt he helped me create behind the scenes this. Maybe, so he was sort of like that Tony Robbins on my shoulder and a really motivational. Yeah, maybe I just felt. now. Yeah, yeah, so maybe with that I just felt I didn't really want. Well, so something I'm a shiny object. want new technology. Everyone's doing social media now. So let me do something different, but like this, you know, this is all really good graphics and stuff.
00:15:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
know we can update it to 2000, you know, 24 terms, but still this was like really damn good. So think about though is that because I've beaten myself up for the jumping around and things that I do, but I'm a generalist. I'm not a specialist. I do have specialized skills and to me, that is leverage and it is simplicity. But it's even those are general type terms, right? They can be applied universally with benefit. But the value that you have in having all of that experience is that the nuance of your knowledge and understanding, one of the greatest assets I have brought to companies that I manage their operations and the way that one of the reasons I was able to get them to grow so well wasn't just my structure. It was my liaising between the different departments because I knew them because I'd done their jobs. I've done copy, I've done graphics, I've done development, not to the same level, but I knew enough to know your program lying to you about how hard this is or how long this takes or how much it costs. fire him. them or fire me because I'm not going to keep putting up with this attitude and him holding everybody else back and things got fixed. But because I understood every aspect of the business, top to bottom, left to right, diagonally, my ability to manage it really well, that's where it came from because I done the jobs. So you understand like multi-channel marketing in a whole new kind of way. You understand the ins and outs of the channels. You know how to leverage a single channel, but you know so many things. Now at this season in life, it may behoove you to stay more focused in a particular realm. the realm can be a realm of slightly ambiguous generality so that still explore nuance. So, for example, with business systems, teams operations, these are the things I talk about. I get to play with technology because systems and technology go hand in hand.
00:18:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Well, that's a whole lot of shiny that I get to play with.
00:18:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And yeah, I mean, that's the biggest thing, technology in terms of project management in terms of automations for customer in terms knowledge and connection and even customer nurturing with the automation, right? So not just acquiring, but nurturing and extracting everything you can out of each customer and increasing the lifetime value, but making that reciprocal and creating the nurturing that gives everything you can back into the customer. That's a lot of shiny for me. That's fun because there's so many different, you know, like AI, all. these different things. But also the psychology of how to do that. So I get to study marketing psychology and I get to study leadership, which is more shiny to me because I love like Adam Grant and I love Robert Chaldini. And those are shiny for me because there's a new thing and I'm like, ooh, what happens if I apply here? But it's still like I've been doing systems. Everybody knows me as a systems person, which has kind of been detrimental to me because I'm way more than that, but that's where put their heads around.
00:19:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
your copy, your marketing, adult productivity as well.
00:19:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, everything. Yeah, mindset. Yeah. So anyway, I do also have to leave at like 1145 because my daughter is home and she needs me to take her to school.
00:19:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So I've got a hard stop in 20 minutes. And I'm really sad because I don't want to talk about all these things. That's okay. Hey, we'll have tomorrow, too. Well, let me update you couple of things. I haven't said anything to Joe, but I can. I can just kind of respond and say, look, Joe, oh, yeah, we've been, sorry, we've also been swamped with other people that want to hire our services for kind of what we have. So we're going to, we don't have a bandwidth right now to help you, but just, you know, and just leave it like that, you know, nice.
00:20:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, you can say whatever. I still think that like it's not even necessary, that you do have other people interested in talking to you, but just the, the message I said might be too blunt for you. I don't know if you remember it on boxers.
00:20:46 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
was long. I thought it was quite long. That's the only thing I thought.
00:20:49 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's totally possible to you.
00:20:50 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But it's so funny. It's totally possible. Let's see. Let's see. Boxer. I thought it left an opening for her to actually still hire us.
00:21:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Um, yes, she wanted to do the pocket CMOC.
00:21:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, but I know she won't. No, she won't because she's asked us a lot more of free.
00:21:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Exactly.
00:21:14 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Uh.
00:21:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You just do search hi, Joe, but it's to be right above that.
00:21:22 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't know how to search in Boxer.
00:21:25 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right up there.
00:21:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Where?
00:21:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the search? Search chat title titles. It's just as titles.
00:21:31 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Never mind. Yeah.
00:21:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You should do control F though.
00:21:36 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Uh, just Joe.
00:21:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Hi, Joe, maybe there it is for Joe.
00:21:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
At least that. Not think about it or apply. might send him this. We have to have all that we said that you want to call your man. I just mentioned we have managed on this one to test where you get it with this offer. Yeah, that's why I thought no, because I think she's still going to be unhappy. Don't you think, if she buys the CMO, pocket CMO, COO, don't you think she's going to be there?
00:22:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
won't buy it.
00:22:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, so just leave it like this then, because you know she's not going to buy it? because she won't buy it, because you still gave her the window, but she's not going to buy it. Okay, okay. Okay. Go through all your . for a of I know I laughed little bit when she said, well, plus the percentages, that's $250,000. thinking, it's $250,000 and nothing, because it doesn't have it's too risky whether we'll get it.
00:22:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That was one of the other causes of mine in Rudy's divorce. the other part of this being long is it's tedious, guess what she's been, tedious.
00:22:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes. All right. Oh. So it's from you, the software that Marie and I put out. So did you want to respond to her with this?
00:23:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
can do that.
00:23:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I can be the .
00:23:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:23:10 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. you do that, yeah, because I've got good news. I got three strong candidates in the pipeline for, yeah. So remember that one guy that we drafted the scope for Grant Mueller? He did pay $1,000. He actually said send me the pay public. So then he said, I'm looking to start this Friday. I know it's your Canadian Thanksgiving. So I said, OK, well, let's all get together with all to send you some information after Thanksgiving. And so by Friday, he gives me access to his account. Is that then I'll send him the other invoice for $4,000? So that's $5,000 a month. So that's good. And then you know who came out of the blue. And again, there's a lot of lurkers, I guess, in the NHB board stuff was I don't know you know. But he's a pretty big player in the manifestation niche. Um, oh my god. He does affirmations Let me go to Facebook get you know us Noah St.
00:24:13 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
is that it that's when you said Noah that was the name of pop to my head that I don't know him I just know the name.
00:24:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, yeah Ditto I think ages ago one of my colleagues did some work for him before he was famous And I know I think I may have consulted him like I'm talking 15 years ago Off for an hour about social media strategy, but that was way back in the day So he so I don't think he knows Recognize that was me because I think it was through a colleague, but um, yeah, that was when he was nothing now look at him So yeah, so he's interested So I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow afternoon. We arrange a call for tomorrow afternoon So nothing's determined yet or anything and then there's another guy that wants to do He also is from NHB Allen's group. He used to have a yoga, the modern yoga.com brand. He sold it off, so it sailed and go that well because the urnout that I was supposed to be paid by the new owners never really came. And that's typical. That's happened to me too when I sold one, something before. And so he said, but he did with that company, he helped yoga instructors establish courses online and sell stuff online and basically do webinar funnels. He said, so I have funnels that really work and I'd really like to get into recurring revenue of Go High Level. So he wants to create a low ticket product that can then put people into Go High Level. Basically giving away that $10,000 course that he used to have. Basically it was given away. So I've been talking him back and forth and I said, I'm simply giving away. You should just create a little take a funnel with that, right? then it blah blah blah. So anyway, he actually is pretty serious as well, but he's in Thailand right now on vacation or something. So we're going to chat tomorrow morning briefly and see if there's any legs. for him, I did tell him $20,000. So yeah.
00:26:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:26:08 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
So we'll have to figure this all out if this all comes fruition because remember, we haven't got an agreement yet, but there are certain aspects where I think initially, I don't mind getting the money coming into me for cash flow of the one client, Brett Mueller. But for the others, if we want to take them, I'd rather see maybe the money going to you in the US, because in Canada, well, they're not Canadian, so it's not an issue. If a Canadian pays me, it's paying me because you got to pay HST because I have an HST license, which is harmonized sales tax, then you got to charge them GST. like GST is like 13%. So if they buy 20,000 from you, you have to add an extra 30% tax or else the government's going to come to me for it. So it's way better for you also taking the money into your US entity and all that jazz.
00:26:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
But I do not know enough about anything in structure, but so how Um, do you get, um, like, is there a different type of payment? So, so like we have employment, self employment tax, and then we have personal tax. So like if the company gets paid a certain amount, that's one thing. And if I as a person get paid a certain amount, that's a different thing, they're taxed differently. So like, how would that work for you? is it just that, um, I would take it and then pay you, and just because you're getting reduced amount, you're not having to pay that initial 13%. So it stays the tax.
00:27:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
how does that work? No, well, well, first of all, like I was mentioning this so that you get money as well. Like this is part of the joint venture because you're helping, you know, with those other clients, like if that's why I would say that, um, those, these warm clients, it doesn't really matter if they're not living in Canada.
00:27:48 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I don't charge only if they're in Canada.
00:27:51 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Okay. Do you have to charge 30% like as long as they're anywhere else in the world, it's not an issue. So that's why like 99% of my clients are outside of Canada. I really don't like having Canadian clients don't really, they take too long to make a decision. First of all, they're very conservative, add the Canadian dollar, I want to get paid in the U.S.
00:28:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
like what I did with Creed is like I would just invoice her, you make money and then whatever the amount, I'll just invoice her.
00:28:15 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
And so I'm like a consultant to you that you're, you're paying, but it's sort of, I'm just thinking down the road because I don't, you know, let's just say if like 20k comes in in the next like 30 days, I want you to have some of that. So that's kind of where that's coming from too.
00:28:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You're good to team.
00:28:39 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That are going to get emotional. Yeah.
00:28:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like you making everybody else money, but like it's good to be able to take care of my people too, you know? Yeah. I, it would be great. And I got to tell you like the gratitude that you do marketing because that's the thing. I don't, I don't whatever. We've had these conversations before. It's just not, I'm ambivert and I really withdraw a lot. Now, to serve is a whole different thing, the marketing aspect of it just drains me. I love the service and I love the work and showing up and getting to do that. And if we could bring in a few high level clients that we could serve really well together. And then if we could siphon off enough time to work on a smaller offer that's scalable, I really think it would be joyful to serve a community together and just to teach people and to love them and to serve them. I think that we'd feel blessed. think we're much as given much as required, know, and God has blessed us with really strong personalities and minds and hearts. And I just know that the world needs it and all the good people. that are out there, there's not enough of them serving. So anyway, I just, I feel happy borrowing joy from the future in the hope knowing that we're building this and just getting to talk to you every day to makes me happy.
00:30:17 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I'm really good.
00:30:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm borrowed joy from the future. So to me, when you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:26 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
But when you hope you borrow joy from the future. Wow. When you worry, you borrow pain from the past.
00:30:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I heard a phrase once that is don't go borrowing troubles. I think it's a, you know, a black thing that I heard. But then I realized that one of my powers has always been even as a kid is, I live in the present, but I always borrow energy from the future that I'm creating. I live in that moment, as though it's the reality. you know, as I got older, it's the kind of a law of attraction, you know, things like, like, it's already happened. And that was never a concept to me, but if actually it had, because I felt it. And I felt the reality of it strongly enough that it brought me joy and energy. So that's what I think about. Like, I can literally borrow energy from a future that doesn't even exist right now of all the infinite possibilities with hope. And it makes me happy in the now.
00:31:49 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I love it.
00:31:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I get to talk to you.
00:31:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
just, every time I'm saying my present, it's just so hey, what trellible. board are you thinking of that that would be part of the scope? said, we'll make them a trellibor so they're responsible for their own data, which I love because as an agency with Emily Hirsch, like we'd always provide them Friday stats, but very few clients I've read it, they'd have no clue still and then you know what I mean? Like I loved your whole thought process of they know what the heck we're doing so they get the value of what they've invested in.
00:32:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yay, let me see if I can find the template that I used to use for base camp because we can start with that. Course creator template bundle? is that? Oh no, that's campa. But I could even create one from scratch because I've done it so many times. I feel like I found it and showed it to you and drive. was a, I think I probably have a few of them, but we, it would be fresh because I don't have anything in Trello. But basically, So, you know, and we can do most of this in our sleep probably, and as we've had conversations and talking about implementation, I rattle off this step, this step, this step, this step, that's what we've done. So basically what you do is you, we could put multiple boards in Trello. So let's say you're launching a new digital offer. And so in there, you would have a copy section and a graphic section and a development section, and then a marketing section, because these are all the pieces that go together. So the first thing that has to happen is the offer has to be created, and then market research has to be done before you can give it to a copywriter or the copywriter is doing it.
00:33:52 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's an assignment.
00:33:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right. So, and then you define does that offer match, right? market research and offer creation. kind of it's kind of a circle like chicken and egg kind of thing one can happen before the other but then you need to go reiterate based based on what you find. So then it goes to copy and then the graphic designer really needs the copy before he can put you know graphics together because there's the verbiage that goes on to the e-books or the ad graphics or whatever. The developer needs the copy and the graphic to landing page, opt-in, So then you've got the developmental operations on that side but then you also add the copy if there's a you know abandoned cart sequence. there's a nurturing sequence after they opt in to send them to a sale where they purchase the sale and then there's a you know follow up or they're upset like all of these things have to be mapped out so all of that could be put into a project management suite and so not only do they wrap their whole heads around it but they could literally just change the title slightly assign a person put a due date and one of the things we can do and talk about is like you know you should expect about this much time for this process to happen if you're doing it well and if you've hired it well you can get this accomplished for roughly this amount of time and money and then we could also pair that up with the PTE maximizer right profit time energy maximizer and go like look make your decisions based off of what you already know here if you're going to hire somebody you know we one of the things we did was your effective hourly rate so who are we hiring or are you doing it Are you writing the copy? you doing the development? Are you putting your name in there? That may be the case because sometimes we've got more time than we have money. Even if we have almost no time, you might be dear money. Anyway, so no matter who we're serving, even when I go on to people who have made millions of dollars, most of them don't have project management suites and they don't have that. So people, so your lurkers, if we do some screenshots of some of this stuff, and it doesn't matter if people steal it, so what? There's enough for us, we don't need everybody to buy from us. We just need enough people to buy from us. We'll make sure that happens if we're out there surfing, so we don't need to worry about who steals and he tries to whatever. You can't take with mine. He won't let you, so whatever. Yeah, so as people, and there will be lurkers who will sometimes, especially if we don't have a high ticket cost where they can come in and check out everything, they'll go on to be like. like Dan does that all the time, Dan Ryan, he goes and buys people stuff and then he goes and hires them for a very long time and gives them a lot of money because he's like, yeah, all your stuff.
00:37:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You're super smart. How do I get you?
00:37:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So anyway, I think that that could be a massive value, especially if on top of that they get access to being able to show up on our weekly calls or ask questions in a group or whatever. And then they start to the questions inspire more questions and more answers. So one person asked the questions that somebody else didn't even know to think and ask about. And then they're all like, oh, and I'm like, well, yeah, I didn't think about teaching you about that. But I could teach you about that. you know, like it all just feeds and builds upon itself. And it could be very lucrative, very quickly, because you don't find a pair like you and me just in there.
00:37:55 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, no, I agree. So but this is specific for like say Grant, right? Like he's probably We're going to want to see some thing happening in Trello.
00:38:03 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you put it up, we would just have one of our conversations, you and me, or even them. And I've just set it up and build it, build it, manage it, run it, do like just do operations, plus support you in marketing, basically, whatever is needed to show up, because the faster we do it, and I, there's also the saying many hands make light work. Like, it'll just be easier.
00:38:30 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And what's cool is that he's probably out of the three. He's the best guy to start with, because he's already got a low ticket funnel started. He just doesn't have a good order bump. He doesn't have enough cell one, doesn't have enough cell two. So he really just needs the refinement versus the other two will be starting something from scratch and a little bit harder to get momentum. But yeah, this would be good.
00:38:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So if you sell anybody and we work together and I get paid, here's what you should know about me.
00:38:59 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Everybody's business like it's own.
00:39:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I'm going to come in and nurture the crap out of it and offer it to serve. also mindful of not stepping on toes. don't need to be the star of the show. I don't need to be ego. Like, we had the conversation with Joe. Like, I talked, I'll lead, but I'm not trying, but I don't need to dominate. I don't need it. You know what I mean? And it's important to know that because sometimes you work with people and you're like, they just, you know, like they got it to go and they want to make it about them.
00:39:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I don't care. I care about you.
00:39:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And I care about how you feel at the end of everything more than I'll care about them.
00:39:43 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. And I'm kind of the same. you know, I've probably give too much to their company, right? yeah. so, I hope I had to be ego more 12 years ago, but I think my ego sort of more humbled out. I was a jerk.
00:40:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I was.
00:40:02 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Okay. So, uh, yeah. So let's just play by your about the other ones. Um, the other two, but I think Grant's in if he made the pause unless he chickens out, we'll see. And then we'll go from there.
00:40:16 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I know you got to go soon. I do. I wanted to. I was so excited. I'm a nerd about like I'm a five year old about this graphic that I made.
00:40:24 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yes.
00:40:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I made it. I'm like, it kind of actually reminds me of one of my client's images. I'm like, did I mentally steal something that we've used before?
00:40:33 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, because it's, no, because it's, it's very similar to the Emily Hirsch one and I'm the intellectual property creator of that.
00:40:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, um, I'm excited. can exist still for a while. As we had, oh, so the colors are blue and orange. That still exists. Am I on that page still? I'm still on there.
00:40:58 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, my gosh.
00:40:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
What?
00:41:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Show me.
00:41:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So, sure, sure.
00:41:01 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You'll learn.
00:41:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sure screen, sure screen. I went to LA for this photo shoot.
00:41:09 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Oh, sure.
00:41:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's not the right thing.
00:41:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's the website.
00:41:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
D4Ybrandbuilder.com. D4Y. Yeah, I turned that into a seven figure agency within month. And then he just destroyed it by taking our too many clients too fast.
00:41:28 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah.
00:41:31 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think that's it.
00:41:32 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Are you in the about? No, so on the home page, there's D4Y and there's a laptop. There's Arthur and I'm to the left of him. Oh, yeah, there you go. And there's .com secrets. Why did he show .com secrets just for the branding?
00:41:53 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's just for what he calls them. Arthur is something else. Oh, brand recognition. see that. like, yeah, he didn't work with them or anything, but he follows that stuff. Competitive analysis, value letter design, strategic evolution, community build-outs, social media management, email marketing, and I ran everything in that company.
00:42:19 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
No, well.
00:42:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Services, let's see what they have for clients. Oh, nature select. I forgot about that. Our rows forgot about them too. Gymnast, whatever. Anyway, we had, we had a graphic and it was kind of like the value letter design. And I feel like after I saw this, I'm like, it seems similar to some D for Y stuff, but I don't remember. Anyway, but Yeah, but it was inspired with the Emily, her stuff, but also for sure.
00:43:04 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I've created other graphics and had graphics.
00:43:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Where's the Canva thing? But, um, what, what I actually liked and what I kept like reiterating is the right thing. Nope, that's not the right thing. Canva design. I'll just go home. Oh my gosh. I just made my thing go away. My daughter don't reply to me.
00:43:27 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
She's probably like passed out.
00:43:29 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It takes lunch anyway at school. She doesn't have to be there right now. But what I kept working on is, and it seems like it wouldn't be that much because there's not actually that much here. But this, whatever we put into here. This is what I think is unique is replicating the will determine maintainable cost and pace of scaling.
00:43:57 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
don't think people really think about that much and I don't think.
00:44:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And if I in implementing complimentary or supplementary offers based on customer feedback, and so that's all the more looking at data, but, but I think that so like this could be a whole kind of PDF and then the next one like break down day zero through 90 and much more detail and 90 through 80 and much more detail, like each of the faces in more detail. So people go like, that's a lot to be giving to me to walk me through to help me do. Um, like I think that we can make amazing webinar slides out of this. Yeah, agree. Easy on the eyes. think it looks professional. I was kind of proud of this.
00:44:45 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think it looks amazing. Can you share that with me? Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't share the link.
00:44:54 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You, you know, it says only you could. Yeah. I think I was going to say. You probably thought of Oh, is this like the done for you brand builder only because it's the blue and the Orange gold. Yeah, I think that's the only similarities So and if you're unsure about that we could change growth Nope, I'm not changing nothing. I've built most that anyway. Yeah, got it Yeah, no, love all this because also this can just be repeatable to sell to other people who want to start an Agency and then that's how we could make recurring revenue. think from go high level because then we can Give them a snapshot of the website that includes the methodology things. Maybe we create some white papers for them Share some case studies they could use It's taking what I did for social media certification, but doing it for like Agencies or entrepreneurs or something.
00:45:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, yes So the snapshots can match up with the projects all set in a way in the in the template Mm-hmm Yeah, anyway, and I do think I think that so the thing that I was thinking is that the visual representation, and I think I sent that in the message, but you know, I'll go do a quick search marketing campaign, low chart, there's tons of these.
00:46:20 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
How come your computer just got really small mobile sized.
00:46:24 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there. So, like, we could make versions of this with our colors and branding. Oh, yeah. But we can make variations of this. what it would look like to launch a main product or relaunch or add an order bump into the mix or upsell or whatever or turn it into a recurring revenue. you had a one off at all, you had this high ticket, like, yeah, how you, you know, so anyway.
00:46:53 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah, no, I get it, Ravi Abubala was good at that using Lucidchart. He, I think, sold a lot of his initial class. Science because he showed a damn good flow chart of stuff. Um, yeah, I have an account for them but I never really used it a lot.
00:47:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I never use it, but I have it and I'm like, you know what? Ryan?
00:47:12 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Did you buy it way back in the days when it was like, yeah, me too.
00:47:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:47:18 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
Yeah. Yeah. I think that produces great flow charts.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Some people use Miro now too, M-I-R Mind. Yeah. Mindjet. Um, what's another one? Yeah, there's one to the man. There's flowy something like that.
00:47:37 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
That's right. Yeah.
00:47:39 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
then the Giffy even G-I-O. Giffy. Giffy. That's the one that Dan has built our org charts with. Yeah. yeah, org charts, like some super basic org charts, like two team org charts and like really show what they're doing. Yeah. How it evolves into three, five, 10, 20 and how You know, you can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team and it's not that difficult. If you do it, right?
00:48:07 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
You can have a multi what business seven figure seven figure. They're right down to maybe that's our slogan Multi seven figure business no one says that Yeah, well, that's my ears perked up because everyone's like here's how to have a six figure business six figure six months I know sounds people like it. They're good hooks, but that's unique You can have a multi seven figure business with a five person team like it's very specific.
00:48:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I like that Yeah, I mean, I've worked to them There are lots of them, but they're not Vanking noise on social media.
00:48:47 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
They're just living their lives. Well, we can also say you can have a multi six figure business with a three person team or two Yeah, two person team.
00:48:56 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, three or or 1.5 right and One is a two point five and the other one's a two point five because and so yeah We can have a whole webinar of team structure and what you could do with that and talking about Operations and teams and going through my profit time energy maximizing go. This is this is what this looks like when when everything is leveraged So I should go wake up my daughter.
00:49:21 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
I think she probably passed.
00:49:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I'm feeling good But she's trying to keep up with school, so okay, I'll let you make let me um, so we'll meet tomorrow I would love to have an agenda for calls as often as we can if we can start getting that slow with that Yeah, I think we're always productive and really good, but as we're tightening it into specific Yeah, um things that we want to accomplish so you're working on the the pedigree and Putting stuff together, and I think we're kind of mentally I think if we put the main focus towards getting a couple of high high-end clients that we
00:50:00 - Maria Gudelis (Maria Gudelis)
can work on serving together.
00:50:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So there's money to build things with and then the time there we will be spending time actually fulfilling that and the rest of it we can be like okay now we've got some assets to work with. Let's build a simple funnel with what we have and that's where our previous trainings will come in and then maybe we just do some live webinar trainings and build content out of that. Something to think about but anyway. So tomorrow let's just pick it up from where we're at right now and then put the intention out that within the next couple weeks try to create agendas for each of our

I'm just looking at my bathroom no highlights and they are so weird because they're a I yeah but like one of them is NHH semi colon period KKKG you know you don't remember that for four minutes you didn't you did not get that done yet my bad my one that one was super important I was crazy it was so important I had to be in my top secret code okay I forgot my decoder mean right wonder twin powers cannot activate yeah and then the other lovely benefit is that I'm pretty sure I didn't save notes again because I don't have notes from last week and I'm on my laptop not my desktop so it's okay But, we've been on the same kind of thread for a while anyway, which is just talking about another 71, the things that you're doing because I want to poke and prod into that. You were, I think you had figured out the cost per acquisition was, I wrote down $17, but I feel like that was not the right number, that it was like 20.
00:01:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think I mean, no, it's, it's around there, I think I had an initial number and then I revised it. Okay. Because I found something more at times, I think it was initially 14 or something. But it's in that neighborhood.
00:01:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So and we were talking about getting reliable data. And so, has there been any movement towards that?
00:01:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, I did figure out. I did figure out that the GA4 is working. Those changes that I made are actually now populating variation data. In there, it just isn't part of the default reporting. You have to go create a report to see it. like, oh, and I don't know how to, this goes to the Mercer thing. I don't know how to get a widget to show up. I figured, I ran the report and it was there and I go, the data's here. Granted, I didn't really try to figure it out. just was like, oh, the data's here. It is registering. Check. don't need to go back to funnel kit. I just need to now go learn how to build either custom reports or see if they like. This should be so great when other people could build reports. That's.
00:03:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Okay, so you could go the Dan does it route or you could let me introduce you to win.
00:03:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right. Yeah, you can do that because now I know the day is in there. The problem before was I didn't think it was in there. It was in there.
00:03:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, I met a bar, like thing in the kitchen here and the stool is really uncomfortable. It's just all I miss my desk. I miss my story. But I love the 113 degree weather. Is really though? Oh, yeah, it is and I really love it.
00:03:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I go outside like every hour.
00:03:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Yeah. I did not love it, but love it. I love it. I hate the cold. It makes me want to keep people. Okay, let's see. All right, so let me just, how do I want to do this? I need to set a reminder for myself to introduce you to win, so let me do that. I want to think about it more than just pop up an email right now because yeah, that will be good. I'm really interested to see just like if you could just have a conversation with him what that would yield. just, like I've said before and I want to, you know, waste time repeating it, but I do think. think that there's um you would just really enjoy him as a person and his brain but also what he knows and you would want to plug into that because like he's just really good at understanding all of it. I think he probably is smarter than Mercer.
00:05:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No sir.
00:05:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah okay so let me go back and look at this one oh okay so I'm framing the question hold on we still need the data basically I'm thinking about the the um well so now I can turn to like segmenters and go all right that's going to be my first step do I think do I trust what's in there and what what is it showing me
00:06:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I don't know, but now I can go over it a bit. Well, yeah, and I also need to figure out like where, I don't know if it pulls sales data from Blue or it does from Blue for sure, but well, I guess I determined that when I make a report. So I would use Blue data. The other bit was, yeah, when I just need to figure out I need to be adding any additional info. OK.
00:06:42 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, it is not just my other computer.
00:06:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Your guard. I live really just walked away from my phone. My phone don't. But you just disappeared like, come on. I just got to remember where I left it. Okay, we're back, we're back, we're yes, who's back, that good game. Yeah, so I just need to now go poke around and figure out. I did poke around and met her and saw my phone and stuff, and there was interesting, but nothing crazy. Okay, and we're waiting for, what's today's day, today's the 20th, so this whole, like this weird thing that's in the 20th, we have to wait, I was like, okay, and then the week after the 25th, we'll know if things are normal, oh no we won't. because that'll be Fourth of July and sales are gonna go down.
00:08:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh yeah.
00:08:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
We have to wait for a week after that and then we'll know. There's constantly like these weird interruptions, so that's gonna be in another one. We're like averaging 40 sales a Nice. Which was my target. And I started running more ads anyway.
00:08:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I remember when it was like 35 or 31 or something and then 35 now.
00:08:40 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It was like 51 at the beginning of the month. But now I think it sounds like between 39 and 40.
00:08:47 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
No, no, I mean the target.
00:08:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, 31.
00:08:52 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah, it was 31. Yeah.
00:08:55 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've actually never reset it because then we fell off it. we're trying to get back to it.
00:09:01 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Have you done the math to figure out um how many daily subscriptions would get you to the 1% market share increase?
00:09:11 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
don't remember doing that math. So here's the thing that I figured out and I kind of want to hit this guy up and be like well that was wrong. Just see what his reaction is. He's like the subscription guru expert. I ran his formula. His formula is incorrect. So his formula said hey you'll cap out and let's say it's 3600. We're 300 over that. Like dude that's a pretty big wrong. Like if it was you know 3625 or you know within 100 but if it's 300 off I'm like that's way too big enough and we keep going up.
00:09:58 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wait it's just getting more wrong.
00:10:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm confused So forever I was looking for What I was calling like In weirdly, this is actually his language which I thought was really funny that The the proverbial glass ceiling like at some point The math is going to be that like no you're going to reach a Level of stasis, right? how do I figure that out? So for years, I never could find anything like I've found all kinds of other formulas around stasis and whatnot and Subscriptions and then there's this dude Robert Scrobe who I stumbled on to maybe two years ago and He has this formula. Hey, this is the the glass ceiling formula or the subscription ceiling point or whatever and And I had not forgotten about it, but I was just not using it because we were in the doldrums, but when I realized, you know, month ago, that, oh, wait a minute, I rediscovered it. And I threw it in a spreadsheet with some other , like data. And then I ran it. I was like, Oh, okay, well, we're averaging whatever 31 today, whatever the number was, right? So the formula is how many new subscriptions who were adding a day. And then you factor in your churn. So I actually used a churn that I would say is, this could be actually not a lot of this could be the reason. Our churn was falsely inflated. Really? So what I should do is go back in and reduce our historical churn. I would say is 21 2021. churn as a result of 2023 had crept up to 25, but it's really not real. So if that's not real and I revise that down to 21, I'll bet it gets closer. Then the question would be, do we go past that? But using the data on hand, it was like, you're going to be, you're done at 3,600. we already surpassed that.
00:12:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah.
00:12:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wow. Which, thanks to Mass, tells us something's wrong, so it has to be the churn. The only thing that can be wrong. Good work, Tina. Literally never thought of that before.
00:12:36 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
was like, oh, wait a minute. Isn't it funny how I really, I mean, I do some work, some of the actual calculations, formatting, some setting up, some things, but so much of it is just unlocking you by asking the question. didn't ask yourself, or you asked yourself, but you didn't make yourself answer.
00:13:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I mean, I wasn't even I wasn't even asking myself that I was just sort of whatever. Yes, exactly.
00:13:06 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that is the whole point.
00:13:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's right. It's like You I can't it's that. I mean, that's why I go solve other people's puzzles.
00:13:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:13:17 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It makes me ask questions.
00:13:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
wouldn't normally ask. And that's what I needed to I'm on the hunt for finding that person for me now because I really do want to build a scalable thing. Okay, for just just like two seconds. So Maria, Maria had that offer. So it's just how people do what they do what they're good at what they're not good at what. So she's really good at selling, but not so great at the follow up because I bought that and the follow up email, which she actually does a really good job of that. She must have an amazing Send her score because she's always about that hit that reply and say Yahoo, blah, blah, but um, so I bought it and it says, okay, and I'm creating a calendar for you, which was a default. all to everybody who bought it, right? To schedule your four hour VIP day. That was over a week ago. And there's been no further emails, no further follow up. So if I'm a person, now I'm just chill about it cause I know something about her and I've talked to her and I know you, but if I was a brand new customer, now I got ghosted for a week after spending $2,000 for somebody, I'd be like, what is going on here?
00:14:32 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And my first thought is something's broken.
00:14:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Well, and what I think though, also with the lack of communication with her is either somehow I pissed her off and she doesn't like me or, and I think that this is the bigger thing is she sells and can't fulfill really well, like she's overstretched.
00:14:51 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I think that's definitely part of it. I was gonna say that her and I's interactions like we have one, one hour call or whatever or two hour call. And then she banged out some coffee and then I banged on the coffee and then I never talked to her again I just would text her, but you know me like I Prefer not to talk to people right and then I could get it done via text and we communicated in the doc, but I Was like most people wouldn't go for this I'm not most people right so I was like, I don't know so it listens to you right now. I go well Yeah, think that is kind of the way she rolls I think I think she has this a bit I would say probably a bit of a scarcity mindset That's why she's always making offers Yeah And that's the thing that's why she's She gets Games right it seems like when I think when I was talking to her she had just she just lost the gig right so she's doing these sort of Fractal blah blah blah see I'm all over the hill you want to call it and then those come and go right so it's like when they go and you're making five grand off of one big hit and then all of a sudden she's hustling doing offers like what you got like I did not wait yeah I was the VIP they went did you I suppose you didn't get the father's day offer or didn't know no because you know what good for her good for her good list segmenting yeah no I did get the father's day offer oh you did bad list segmenting and it is well it's not really though because at discount as a discount no it's funny that she that I'm even on that list it's like girl why are you sending me a 27 dollar office like yeah now that that whole segmenting um yeah and
00:17:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The whole thing is like, I don't think I'd want my higher end clients to be getting like that.
00:17:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Right.
00:17:07 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Right.
00:17:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And I literally was expecting a higher price.
00:17:12 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
funny.
00:17:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I, when I clicked her, was like, really, you're like, this is, you're sending me up your entry level offer.
00:17:20 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Like what are you doing? she's had somebody dub her like the low ticket queen or something like that, low offer queen. And so I feel like she's just kind of leaning into that, which actually the time from the things that I'm seeing in the market, that's the trend and, yes, again, but I think that the difference is that because buyers are so much more savvy, they now want to sample and where it used to be a tried and true, those that pay the least expect the most. I'm watching that those that pay the most have been burned so much by just handing over money to salespeople that they're like, where's your proof dude?
00:18:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
you're not getting my money until I get referrals and all the money you say that I agree.
00:18:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I think I've seen a bit of that lately, too. Yeah, where it used to be like, you know, just somebody make a recommendation or whatever, here's $50,000. And now, yeah, it's just, there's definitely a shift in it. Because of that, though, it's even more imperative to do testing and not make assumptions. But I've always leaned more towards the low to high ascension anyway. I feel like if somebody wants to refund at a low level, whatever, it causes you some merchanting issue. But I think that it's really easy to over-deliver on that and kind of negate it. But if somebody buys three different things from you ascending up and then they want to refund, it's pretty clearly that it's them, not you. So I feel like just, the standard operating for business and this might be relative to what you're doing with the music stuff because you do have an ascension I think potential there that having something super low ticket next to like under ten dollars then twenty thirty dollars then what I saw her conversion rate was crazy because she showed me some of the back end stuff so when she tried front end at twenty dollars the conversion rate was like five percent same exact thing at three dollars the conversion rate was seventy five percent but this was what was crazy the conversion rate for the twenty five dollar offer same thing after that so as an upsell was fifty five percent to the cold traffic compared to three percent to cold traffic when it was the front end So now that's just one thing once, right? it's definitely can't be a standard for all things. But it was really interesting how much that. And then the conversion rate to a $2,000 after that was like 15%. So for cold traffic, that was still really solid conversion rates. Anyway, just lots to be thinking about. But it doesn't matter if you're going to ruin your reputation by not fulfilling stuff. That gets bad really fast. Anyway, fascinating. so the original question was, what's the matter for subscriptions in relationship to obtaining a 1% market share? You went to, there was this ceiling, this map that this guy had this formula. So you're going to revisit it to come back with that answer, right?
00:20:59 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I've never done that calculation. So that's like the sort of gold that I laid out was that, but the problem is based, like, you know, me do it. I have to revisit the 1%. So the 1% calculation I did before is now incorrect because as part of my recent five, our, this is the thing, this sucks, all these eppin changes that they made. I'm like, don't know if I can trust this. So there's two ways I can go about this. I can take the 1% calculation that I did before, which is old data and use that because that data while old or three ways I could do this. I could go revisit that calculation and then, oh, , no, I can't, I can't go. I don't think I could go back and use like 2018, 2018, So that's like the sort of gold that I laid out was that, but the problem is based, like, you know, me do it. I have to revisit the 1%. So the 1% calculation I did before is now incorrect because as part of my recent five, our, this is the thing, this sucks, all these eppin changes that they made.

I can take the 1% calculation that I did before, which is old data and use that because that data while old or three ways I could do this.
00:22:50 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I could go revisit that calculation and then, oh, , no, I can't, I can't go. I don't think I could go back and use like 2018, 2018, 19. So I was like, Oh, just use pre COVID.
00:23:02 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
No, all the numbers are F. I guess the best case scenario was would be revisited, do a lifetime calculation that accounts for everything and changes global pandemic. Right. Huge screw up somewhere in the fall of whatever the hell you hear that was. Well, actually, no, that would be in it. So it'll be whatever has happened with a ninja. I just do it in ninja. I don't do another 71. I just, that's all crash data. I just don't use it. But when I recently did, I revisited the lifetime value, it was way higher. And I was like, Oh, , that's way higher, like, over $100 higher.
00:23:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So that then changes. I guess that doesn't actually change the 1%.
00:23:50 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That just changes the value of the one person. Right. You're right. Right.
00:23:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There has to be fixed based off of
00:24:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
of how many people are in the market, not how valuable they are to you.
00:24:04 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. So the problem with 1% is we're already exceeding that. The rate at which we are right now is way above 1%.
00:24:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, I can't increase 1% when I'm increased over that already. Like, I don't know where we're going to land to say, okay, this is our actual average. And then I want increase that 1%. When I was trying to increase 1% from 31, well, it's already done. We're 10% about that.
00:24:35 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, okay, well, we can't really increase 1% and I've increased 10. But I'm not even sure I've increased 10.
00:24:43 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Wait a minute. Okay.
00:24:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Let me just keep clear here though, because are you talking about a 1% increase in your business with your target? Because I thought you were trying to get 1% more of the market. Oh, yeah, good point.
00:24:57 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I need to.
00:24:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And what I'm a. So that goes back to how many buyers does that equate to because that should be relatively easy map If you knew what the market size was by a number which you'd have to know if you know what your percent Yeah, that's whatever whatever spreadsheet that's in I I don't know the number. We don't know the actual number I used I think I used the lowest number that was publicly available to us.
00:25:27 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's like eating out So I need to look at And is that 80,000 every year It's yeah, it's like an average like a rolling average So that would mean So you're getting a percentage of that 80,000 and you're saying you thought you were at 6 percent Eleven Eleven Okay, was it alone? Okay. And so how many new customers did you have in 2023? And how many have you had in 2024 so far? New?
00:26:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I don't know.
00:26:19 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
have to go around the report. Okay. currently paying at some point during 2023. I'm not sure where you're at. are you asking how many individual customers paid us or how many active subscribers? Well, me ask you this way. How would you identify your portion of that 80,000? How would you identify and define your marketer? So that's what I'm asking.
00:26:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
How many did you have in 2023? how many do you have so far?
00:26:56 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, the things that we track. So that. We have new customers and new subscriptions, so that 31 is actually new subscriptions, right? That's not new customers.
00:27:08 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
New customers is lower.
00:27:12 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So new customers is the factor that you use for market share, right?
00:27:18 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So the market's 80, I'm saying we get 10,000 customers a year would up first. So yeah, I mean, offhand, I couldn't tell you how many customers we've got this year, but I could go run it. I can run that on the torque of the drop pad. Can we do it now? No, because my laptop's in the house. I'm up on Perch 2.0 looking at the ocean team, huh? Listen to your voice, listening to your voice, looking out over the horizon. All about hurt and the relaxation button band. I got to earn my phone. I was just on the support chest like an hour with GoDaddy. Only to find out I can't do what I want like oh my god. Did I really spend an hour?
00:28:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Doing this yes, that is the worst that will literally ruin my mood for hours. Oh my god. I'm ruined. I'm a headache Seriously anytime with customer support All by itself is always like seriously wreck Emotionally I hate it. I don't I wish that I was like Full dreaming, but then to not get it resolved and to have spent that time I Don't know why it affects me so badly, but it Literally like imagine a battery icon and it you can watch it drain The life force is doing like that's what I feel like so I feel you Okay, well next week You either have that or be where we can go look at it together.
00:28:59 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Is that fair?
00:29:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I can send you an email reminder. Sure, I have a spreadsheet with it all and they're already, I've definitely done this. But what I probably don't have the last time I did it was November, but I probably don't have like the true 2023 total, but I can get it, yeah. Okay, what I'm asking you is by next week, will you either have that done or be where we can go get it during, okay, I'll either be done or I'll have a computer, yeah.
00:29:37 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And do you need a reminder for that? No.
00:29:41 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Okay. Promise?
00:29:44 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I need this stuff for those broker dudes too, because they, they had asked some stuff for them. And they, they got into our books and they were like, your books are a mess. I'm like, have I mentioned my partner to CPA, we're shocked.
00:30:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
the mechanics car never drives like yeah yeah they're like what is this entry I was like I don't know I got to Jeff Jeff what is this entry what oh my god really so then I get him so then I send him Stacy right Stacy other Stacy that works with me was working with Sean I don't know if she's still helping probably not and then I send her impotor Jeff and Jeff's like I know Stacy and then it dawns on me oh that's right I found her to get our books done what happened oh I stopped yeah five or three years ago I'm like and here we are again he's like I just didn't want to pay her five hundred bucks bro you didn't there and her updates are hilarious she's like you haven't entered anything in over a year
00:31:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I'm like, oh, God.
00:31:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Wow. Now we're paying her like $5,000 to fix it all.
00:31:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm like, how did that work out, Joe?
00:31:09 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So 10 months worth of $500, and he could have just paid it. Yeah, and it would all have been up to date, and then I wouldn't be broke. you would be sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Oh, that's a good time. Oh, my gosh. OK. Oh, so, Mark, I might, um, kind of all of it out, Tina. Spit it out. You know, like, I always have like five stops that want to come out at the same time. It's the heat stroke. It's not. I'm freezing because or once everything is like, icebox and I like heat. But no, I hate it. I'm always blown up. like, is there? air-conditioning on? No, yes it is. Yeah, I don't mess with it, though, okay? Gaslighting.
00:32:06 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
like, there's your lighting. No, it's not on.
00:32:10 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Anyway, so Lorenz, because we were talking about, um, how, huh? Po-changer, whatever, yeah. Yeah, yeah, well, I mean, because Lorenz went from, I don't remember what it was, like, around, uh, a million dollars a month for attorney fees, and then we had that meeting. By the time I talked to him again three months later, he had almost doubled what he was doing before. So I'm like, dude, my coaching is already paid for. You should just let me work with him, because he's still complaining about Lorenz's pace and ability to manage the team. And he's finally come around. think he talked about it on our meeting that, you know, we can't. hire the best people, which we had that conversation from day one, because he's not going to pay top prices for those people. And it would exist. Well, yeah, but yes, there's that. But also, there's no guarantee that they'll stay. That doesn't mean any kind of loyalty or whatever. I think you get more loyalty by growing people and giving them a place and they know that they're you know, CRB players, and then you raise them up, you know what I mean? And I think Lorenz falls right in that. He's not sure how to open to it.
00:33:31 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But I'm like, basically.
00:33:33 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Sorry, there's so much noise.
00:33:34 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I'm not sure if I hear you loud and clear. If you're talking. good.
00:33:40 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So I'm like, basically the coaching was already paid for by just what Lorenz has done and improved.
00:33:47 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So let's just get in there and make that team better.
00:33:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So Samantha, Samantha does good enough financially, and he's figured out what people to put on her team that we don't really, the fact that she doesn't want to be open to it doesn't matter. But we can work with the people who do. So then the the invoicing I'm like well we should just pause whatever you want to do with the splitting and like the end of your stuff because his 10 million dollar settlement came in and he's got to think about taxes. like just wait and maybe we'll bundle all of that together or something but uh and then there's Dolce you know the dog situation and he's working super late at night and yeah then I was a day born to Selco. What's that?
00:34:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
I said 14 hours a day according to Selco. He's like a market legitimately uh as Selco said finally learning his business. All right I mean I don't know I don't know if you really realize that before the king never went to work. He was never there. He never went in. I heard you. So what I'm gonna try to do then is just tap
00:35:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
into what's already happening, if he's going to be there a lot, then I'm just going to be more, was going to use the word aggressive, but it's not really aggressive, but just more frequent in the questions and then the, like if he's here, if he's in the season of getting work done, I want to tap into it and help him, I don't know, do whatever he can do, but then also he was like kind of quiet this week. So I was like, is everything going on? Like apparently I didn't tell you I'm a human bear, not barometer or something like that, but basically when the weather changes, it's a headache and can't work, so. Oh, it's way more than that. The divorce is next. I mean, like he's going to, he's going to go, the only question is, and I don't think he will, Salka thinks he's going to go off the rails. I'm like, I don't think he's going to go off the rails. Salka's like, he's going to go off the rails. So I don't think so, man. He's. He's directing his energy in the right place. Yeah, he is doing that. But I do see him going, what am I doing? Like, and just finally cutting the cord. So I said, oh, yeah, I so the one thing I asked and he didn't respond to. And because I'm not really the one that asked this is like, did you go talk to the guy, you know, that you were asking about the counselor, whatever? And, and then I just kind of like glossed over that. Went to a big question. Yeah, but it's really not for me. So what I, what I did do is send them a good message of like, good, like, you know, kind of about what these are the things that when, when these things are shaky in my life, everything falls apart. So if they start to shake at all, I go fix them. Like in the past, it's been money. When they're when it's not there and I'm not sure about things like I'm stressed. I can't even think straight. I can't talk. my mood is crap, like everything's terrible, and then the next thing would be my relationship with the girls. So anytime I have problems with the girls, like it's bad.
00:37:09 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So I make sure I don't ever have money problems, and I give my girls like priority, so and make sure like be proactively, you know? Anyways, and oh, the other thing is I have to get sunshine every day, like the things to protect my mood, because I'm the steward of the ship, like I'm the cat, and I gotta make all these things happen. So I have to get sunshine every day, I gotta move, and I have to eat food to protect my mood, because I'm prone to depression, and he has to, which is why I was talking about it, like avocados and salmon and things like that. But he's taking grown into the office, and oh, we knew that was yeah, he's been taking it like since Monday, at least, I don't know if he did it before that, but I think that's super good for him.
00:38:00 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
and I really do. That's a good idea of channeling. But, um, the other thing, I'm like, go hug your mama a lot because to lose his dad and his dog, like, was it this, his dad passed this year?
00:38:13 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
It's been recent. And so I'll give you the quote he gave to Selco. And I was like, ouch. And he said, I lost my dad. So I lost, I lost the person that helped me with my head. I lost my dog and I lost my heart. was like, that's just slightly sad. Like, Oh, Lord. Yeah. So yeah, it was. And I think that weirdly or not, maybe not, the dog dying just reinvigorated the dead dying 100%. Yeah. And so now Selco loves. Yeah, he's like, I don't know where he's gonna go. And he, those two talk constantly, constant. weird to me because in the beginning, like, I know that that's how you got involved. But Mark made it sound like he's damn psycho. He doesn't want him. He didn't want him to be in the business, right? But even that even he even relented on that. I was floored on Monday when he was like, basically, and I called this two months ago, month and a half ago. I was like, we're eventually going to get to the people. Well, we're there. Except I didn't think he'd go intake then lawyers. But that's exactly what he did. I actually talked to Salco yesterday and I said, he started with Lorenz and Patrick. But I'm like, we all know that Sam and Tyler are next. Like, nobody's safe. And they shouldn't be because that like, I'm not going to tell you what to do, Tina, but here I'm going to tell you what to do. All you got to get from Patrick and Lorenz is what do you need help with? That like Like this is I mean, it's not a nice way to say this, but like Mark's not a good lawyer and Therefore they're not good lawyers, right? So it's like they can't become better lawyers if the lawyer that they're working for is not good at the thing, right? He's not because he he if his background was he ran the intake For Jacobia Myers. He wasn't a lawyer there. Yes. He was a lawyer, but he wasn't a lawyer there He was a lawyer that ran the intake team and that's why he was good at that, right? That's why That became a strike for him here But as like an actual practicing lawyer Salka's a better lawyer by miles, right? But Salka doesn't want that's why Salka's in their training What's his name? Let's see the kids name Nick Salkos got Nick doing the LIT department, and then he wants to start looking at the pre LIT stuff, and now you're going to go look at the pre LIT stuff, and the problem with pre LIT is system. Salkos convinced, I said it to you, it's these nine steps. That's it, it's like nine steps. These guys aren't lawyers, right? Like they just have law degrees because it's a pre LIT firm, which means they're never stepping foot in the courtroom. Therefore, they're never really being a lawyer in the true sense of getting in front of a jury, making argument, blah, blah, blah. They're mostly pushing paper, and if they followed literally a checklist, then they could be better at their jobs. The problem is that checklist doesn't exist. It can exist, but presently it does not exist. Not because of his version of the checklist, Mark sort of got his version of the checklist.
00:42:05 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
There's some, you know, disagreement about how some things work, but ultimately the data will say which one's right or wrong or whatever. So my guess is the problem with Lorenz is not managing people. It's managing the system.
00:42:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Well, you can't manage the system that doesn't exist.
00:42:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And that's the problem. There is no system. There's a sort of system. We know that we know that A and B, right?
00:42:36 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
So there's a black box in the middle and it's like, okay, what's happening in there exactly? Everyone doing it the same? there a way to make this better to get a higher percentage of cases settling at the policy rate? The answer is yes.
00:42:55 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
The thing is that no one's extracting it, right, which you're great at. it. it, and then, and then, you know, once it's out, once the pieces are on the table, preferably, right?
00:43:07 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
start putting it together. Well, that was insightful and good. I'm trying to figure out, because he's not sure Patrick's open to it, but I think there's only one we only need one. Yeah, I agree with that. That's a good thing. Patrick isn't in Arizona, though. He's in so I don't know. I only need one. Let me hear the rest of your logic behind that. It's because they're all doing the same thing. So it's like the system is the system. It exists outside of people, right? I get that. Okay, so for creating system, I only need one. That was what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. Got that. I need all the attorneys to be their best. Oh, I was confused, but not good. I mean, the way that they get better is by working a system, right? It's like, it's like, like, and I think that the system Salco knows the system and the question is, can you take what they're saying they need, what Salco is saying, and then like Josh and go, okay, let's make let if I do this so that it's just, it's like, follow the yellow brick road. Just, just follow the yellow brick road and things we've talked about. I mean, it's super cool that like, it's all now happening and it's, it is happening faster than I thought it was, but this is like the final frontier. It's like, okay, let's figure this out. Now, whether Mark moves in this direction of, hey, yeah, I'm downsizing. And like, I'm just going to run this super tight firm at like super high margins. or not remains to be seen, or I talked to Salka yesterday. So like, Salka was like, hey, you know, like they're still trying to figure out a way to work together. And I don't know if they'll get there, but I was saying how this KSHQ to me, potentially, had solved the one thing that was like, dude, if we were signing these cases, signing retainers, instead of sending leads to someone else to sign them, like, we'd be so much better off. But we didn't have a method to do that. Like, he didn't want to hire an intake team. for a while, he was like, well, he was marks. And I was like, I don't know if that's gonna work, right? He's gonna, right? seemed weird. But now you have this KSHQ guys, and I go, so literally yesterday I go, holy , I didn't actually think about that. Like, they saw, we've never had a lead gen problem. We always had to leave, follow a problem. Right. only problem with those guys is I hate the software that they use. It literally creates work for me. So I pitched to Robert for me and him to get on the phone. And I was like, I've got a solution that will make your life easier. And it's like a living thing, right? I can get him on lead blowing and he just opens up the hood, I'll be like, yeah, dude, I can make your so much better. But then that in term, it marks the better. And then that becomes a resource for shall go. And then it can better align sweet love myself. And so I'll go with these ad surgery dudes, which is, I think. Those guys are super interesting in that they just want to generate leads. They don't want to go around with any of this other stuff. I'll be back in overall. I'll do the systems. Okay, there's something here.
00:47:02 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
That's why I would mark that that Arizona firm thing today. was like, and that might be the way to go. I thought that before, except, you know, that dude did it totally wrong, goes against private equity money.
00:47:15 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
But, you know, it's like, just like I said, me, know, you have all the money in the world.
00:47:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
You can't execute. It doesn't matter. he had 3.3 million in revenue, and we know as pre-lit insiders, he should have been paying about 200 bucks a lead and about four grand a retainer. And if he wasn't, which I'm willing to bet he wasn't, then he was screwed from the start. And if he had never been inside a pre-lit law firm, how could he possibly know those numbers? Even better, even if he had, that firm didn't know it, marks the only one that knows the numbers, and that's because we made it the same. Right. reality. Yeah. What to think about but the I always have to think about the person like I don't I have to in in the sense that like, oh, yeah, totally. Do it. Yeah. And think about like where he's at in life, what the you know, the probability there's possibilities and probabilities, right, about where he's going to go, what kind of pace he can work at. of course, there are, we're thinking about this yesterday, I was talking to my friend, Samantha, and I'm like, there's pace pockets, like inside of this pocket, this is the pace and the pace can be different all around us. But also, we can have so like inside a sweet law, there are different pace pockets, Samantha has her pace. Lorenz has his pace. Mark has his pace and they all are under the same roof, but operating kind of at different speeds and almost kind of self-contained units. I know he's got pods, but there's that and there's the autonomy of those pods and what he's doing and whoever is the one in charge that has the power that drives that. What's going on in their personal lives always will affect it no matter how good the system is, no matter how good the tools are, but if the system is such that it's engineered to be max leverage, meaning it requires the least amount of mental effort and energy so that when that person is operating on a lower level, because divorce, Samantha pretends
00:50:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
actually mark, I mean, death, sickness, babies, all these different things. If the system is maximally leveraged, then even at their lowest, the company is still okay, everything's okay. But when it's max leverage and everybody's operating at their highest, then we have the seasons of like just sprinting and mass and growth. But because it was based on the system using the system, it should still be sustainable and maintainable. Even when things when the person slows down a little bit. So everything that I'm doing is trying to figure that out. But but again, I'm not in person. I'm not watching things we talk one hour a week. But yet, look at all the growth that's happened in that amount of time. So that's that's kind of amazing. Anyway, I mean, I think he's in the spot right now. Oh, it's like this. It's, I mean, it's potentially highly pivoting point in his life, right? like, it's like, I mean, he just has to cut bait. His marriage is a show. So it's like way worse. It's way worse than you know, let's put it that way. I don't know anything about it. Do you want to or do you not want to your call? My I do, but I should not. So that's why I never mentioned it to you. So it's like it's I have no I know why he's not doing it because I because we know him because he is emotional or whatever. But the fact of the matter is he should have never got married to her. He was warned to not get married to her. Explicitly, he was questioned. Why are you even doing this? And he did it and I think part of it is is he purposefully picks someone that's broken, right? Because he's broken. And it's like, but now I think he's getting to this place where he's like, I don't want to be broken anymore. And it's like, well, then you have to, you have to separate yourself from what the broken version of yourself is created, right? And the broken version of himself created romper room, which he, so he's going to clean up a romper room first. And he's just doing it faster than I thought. And it's like, okay, man. But, you know, he is in this spot right now where it's like, you got that $10 million settlement, which by the way, he didn't work on zero work.
00:52:51 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He just gets the benefit, right?
00:52:53 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
The work that he did was he got that lead. So it's like, okay, you're going to get this $10 million settlement. And now you're putting this. focus on work, and it's like, if he taps into you, in a way, it is go time, right? It's like, okay, if he's going to put his attention towards work, and he's going to bring you into work on some other stuff, and he's got this ginormous influx of cash, it's like, you know what, this is the time to take the next step. But, and I pointed this out to Salka yesterday, and it ties into just what we were talking about being a second ago, it hit me yesterday, after our call on Monday, you were like, oh, just go get another vendor. That's really not a thing, right? But the fact of the matter is, that's not a thing, practically, right? Because new people can come into the market, that's all. Yeah, but it's like, but it's not likely that we're going to find somebody new and or that they're good, and that they're going to move the needle very much, right? it hit me yesterday, I was like, oh, He's he's gonna the growth is gonna start to slow down and It's not necessarily a bad thing right like he looks outside at Steve or whatever But what Steve is doing. They're not doing the same thing So you can't look at Steve's results and expect those because what Steve is doing in my opinion is Steve is buying brands So Steve is buying these branded firms and it's not this firm. That's Kicking on Facebook ads or Google ads or whatever. It's a firm that's been around for 10 years And they did and they they're getting a lot of referral business Like if we could go into the hood, that's what you'd see you'd see like I know they don't have 300 leads from monkey and blah blah blah whatever Right they have the same people coming through the doors that have been coming through the doors for 10 years And maybe they're doing buss ads and maybe they're doing like more of the traditional stuff But the the core of that business is built around referrals in a brand And well, if you buy 10 of those, get 10x that, right? Or to whatever degree. So when Mark looks at that, I'm like, no, you're never going to be that. I mean, you will be in 10 years once you build up your brand.
00:55:17 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
So it's like he's now going to be at this thing where his model is going to cap out. Unless and until he can figure out a way to generate leads on demand, which I'm not sure is a thing, to be honest.
00:55:35 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then God forbid, like a monkey or something goes up, because that's still a huge problem.
00:55:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
when a bunch of your business, I mean, granted, he's spread out that risk now across multiple vendors. But still, it's like they go sideways. You're instantly damaged. So it's like he needs to keep that in mind. So it should be like building the doctrine that built building the internal assets that you do control the doctrine at work the referral portion the bump of a and yeah, you can keep looking for vendors, but And stop looking outside stop looking at Steve stop looking at models that are not akin to what you're doing right Right and the other thing is okay, so he this week Tuesday referred me to One of his friends who's a doctor for coaching Fuji Naka Well nice, but nice yeah, he's like he was looking for a coach and He said he thought it would be a good fit so I've been talking back and forth and then he's in love with Mark like that the dude in Arizona No, he's in You know to the way that he's talking about Mark as a mentor and the way that he feels about him. It's really obvious that Mark is special to him, and I've seen enough just in how Mark takes care of his mom and how he talks about, know, the romper room isn't, like, business is his social, like, he needs a family and Dr.
00:57:26 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
He needs, yeah. Well, it's a service.
00:57:30 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
It's a surrogate. It is. He does need a family but I'm afraid he's boxing himself out there. Yeah, but my point is that I'm taking this back to pace and also to who he's modeling after. So like, and that was part of the message that I sent to him today, you know, he's modeling and targeting these businesses that are doing things he doesn't want to do. They're using ethics or a lack thereof that he would not. I want to do and so that he really needs to take into account the things like he's living this life where people Fall in love with him because he loves them and supports them and encouraging and the way that he talked about his friend was like Like it like a brother, you know, love it. It wasn't that he used but but the language was very obvious Like there is like they love each other And that that was the dude down here Zach loves Mark My point is that Mark is not these guys that he's been trying to chase after and to your point of You know, what what path he'll choose and what he's gonna do and where he's gonna go You know People do what they do and I don't know, but what I have seen Mark do Is repeatedly check himself like I've seen him go off the rails a little bit And I've seen him Do things that aren't really prudent But I've seen him respond to
00:59:00 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
our council and other people's council and check himself and go, you know what, I gotta just do this and I just gotta do that. Which is probably also why he's at this point where he's at where he wants to be respected and cared for at home also. But that whole thing is a long journey and most people take a lot of dips in it, but I, over the three years, what I have seen being more consistent is that he purposely puts himself in a path to talking to people who will call him out, who will tell him what he needs to hear, even if doesn't want to hear it. He will go quiet and process it rather than sound like he's hearing it and then he'll work on improving. So, I mean, three years is, that's a pretty steady... I don't think he'll go off the rail. No, I don't think so. Salco's not sure. Well, I don't think he will. Yeah. But I do think that he's going to.
01:00:15 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
He's going to have, he's, he's approaching as, as sort of, you know, the scales fall away, whatever metaphor you want to use, right?
01:00:24 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
That's happening. And it's like, it's unavoidable.
01:00:27 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
And he's going to have to face things that, I don't know that he's necessarily been avoiding them, but they've just been comfortable. And it's like, he's going to start to have some clarity around the things that he really does want, right?
01:00:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
and he, he is good about like moving past things, right? It's like, he's moving past the idea like, oh, I can just hire someone in.
01:00:54 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
I can, I can just increase the size of the team and I'm going to get there. like, no, a. No, my argument was always, you don't even need to do that. The math doesn't support it.
01:01:04 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
And then the market wasn't supporting it either. So it's like, OK, internal, which it was him. Like when he asked you to do that on Monday, I was like, no, I didn't see this. Got me. But OK, it was a good move. Um, I just saw a lizard outside. had to take a picture of it.
01:01:22 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
OK, I had just my chair.
01:01:25 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
was like, where did that puppy go?
01:01:26 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
Oh, there it is. Yeah. Yeah, I don't appreciate non-getting puppy pictures. Gee, Dan. You get none? So rude. You sent me one picture. That's it. I'm like, come on. Newsflash.
01:01:38 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

01:01:41 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:01:46 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
Oh, up. is it 104 already? Because I was on support to go down for an hour. Isn't that related to this?
01:01:57 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)
All right, well, I got to go run. and errand but um hold on let me just close my I gotta go take I gotta go take some Advil or something. What were you saying? Uh it was funny as I was convinced it was from work. I was like yesterday or Tuesday or whatever I was like I think I get headaches when I come to work. No.
01:02:18 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

01:02:21 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:02:28 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)

01:02:43 - Tina Marie (profitdriversinc.com)

01:02:49 - Dan’s iPhone (danddcompany.com)
